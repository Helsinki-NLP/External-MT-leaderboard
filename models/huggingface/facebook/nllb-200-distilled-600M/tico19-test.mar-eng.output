The combined incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom has been increasing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The combined incidence of COVID-19 cases is showing similar patterns in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although the stages vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care centres should step up their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially: ultra-efficient treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of unknown cell lung pneumonia cases were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the new coronavirus as a pathogenic medium, which is now called acute severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) because it was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of people affected by COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 takes the form of more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases are more severe requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we assessed the combined nature of COVID-19 cases in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with those in Italy between 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread further geographically and the rest of the world's COVID-19 epidemic figures are now following the situation in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 publication of EuroSurvelance 2020, Spiteri et al, reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by WHO.
In the EU/EEA, France notified the first three fixed cases of return from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded as of 31 December 2019 and up to that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting Combined Number of COVID-19 Cases and Combined Cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from each country worldwide, for which information is updated daily at 8:00 am using authorized sources such as the Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO of the countries.
The data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and to compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the combined 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the aggregate number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 and compared them with cases in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The nature of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
The overall pattern of the 14-day split combined cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK is similar to Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA as a whole and in the UK, the combined cases of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and then started to rise rapidly by 28 February 2020 (supplementary content).
This included the fastest growing reported cases in Italy, but also the increasing combined incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It highlights that at 8am on 15 March, the same number of cases in Italy as in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK were already reported 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The observed nature of the combined cases of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparatively fast pace across all countries.
In addition, while different countries are at different stages, the gap between national public health responses and the possible definition of different cases and different protocols of patient selection between countries need to be checked for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19 require hyperactive therapy, and media sources have indicated that hospitals and hyperactive treatment centers in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care centres is currently available for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively at EU/EEA level (data not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a consistent systematic manner that will focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study in 2010-11 showed that there is a significant difference between the number of hypermedical and mediocre medical beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have fewer or more resources than Italy (with 12.5 hyperthermia and medium therapeutic beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The trend of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and UK is associated with a higher risk of exceeding > 90% of the intensive care bed capacity of healthcare care capacity saturation, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are still limited to certain EU/EEA countries and regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care centres are providing treatment to a certain regional population, case information and information on superconducting centres should be made available as far as possible as defined by Regional Centres for Figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience of Italy and the current situation in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and hyperactive care centres need to prepare themselves for the ongoing community infection situation of SARS-CoV-2 and the growing number of patients suffering from COVID-19, who will need to maintain health surveillance and especially hyperactive care, as the situation has been in the affected regions of Italy.
A fast, active and inclusive approach to nanotation is needed rather than delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, as the expected rapid increase in such cases will not allow decision-makers and hospitals to assess, accept and absorb their response if not implemented ahead of time.
Public health measures have also been listed in Rapid Risk Assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can step up their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA healthcare systems will have to deal with a wave of patients who will need hypertherapy within the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and infected more than 80,000 people and has been a disaster for humanity.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV-2 which caused thousands of people to get SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been infected by the same virus and exhibited similar symptoms through the same technique.
The severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, but the infectious capacity is higher and it is more prevalent among the elderly than among the youth and among the men than among the women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the research topic being developed.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and combat this dangerous disease.
The Spring of 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese who were told to stay home for the entire holiday and for weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new infectious disease.
The virus is very homogeneous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was designated by the World Health Organization on 11 February 2020 as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease as COVID-19.
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has affected 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), over 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published in just two months, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020, which has determined the sequence of the virus in addition to the various patients.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in new and slowly developing fields.
When possible, we will try to compare SARS-19 and other COVID-19-related diseases with Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis and the urgent issues that remain unresolved.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-fatal to humans, primarily causing about 15% of cold cases.
However, we have faced two very deadly human COVID-19 infections in this century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started out in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread quickly to other countries with extremely deadly disease and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID outbreak in recent human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first group of pneumonia with unknown origin was reported by the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the order for the COVID was issued.
The first fatality was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were reported infected, which showed that human-to-human transmission can occur.
On January 23, a total lockdown was imposed in Wuhan and all public transportation was closed.
On January 24, the first medical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had come into direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market which was thought to be a centre of early infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2.2).
The final state and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain as the situation is changing rapidly.
A multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented an updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages but primarily targeted people aged 30-65.
Half (47.7%) of those infected were 50 years old, a few were under 20 years old, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/1,00,000) than women (0.27/1,00,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly to the city groups in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the time of COVID-19 infection to diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from diagnosis to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased tremendously before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the large pre-spring outbreak in China.
The mortality rate of patients with fixed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that contains a single strand of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) glycoprotein binds its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the cell membrane; after the virus replicates the genome, the genomic RNA forms a virion-containing vesicle with overlapping glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which are then integrated with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new strain of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples taken from the outbreak's origin center at the Hunan Seafood Market in Hunan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 molecules have been found in extremely thin areas of the human airway.
ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which in combination causes less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a new small protein, which is encoded by orf3b and the enriched protein is encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or purpose.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å has been blended with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the structures of the spores that were open and closed were combined as dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 spores could bind to two S proteins, which provide evidence of identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Medium Host
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from the caterpillars and were transmitted to humans from the feeding cats and camels respectively.
When genealogically compared to other SARS-CoV-2 CoVs, the wormholes were considered to be the local hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to the wormholes' bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 CoVs, such as SARS.
However, it is unknown which medium carrier helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans and the route of transmission remains unclear.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes should be carriers to reach humans from the vertebrae, where there must be homogeneous reproduction between S proteins.
A study by researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggests that the long-nosed, mosquito-eating cat used in traditional Chinese medicine may be a potential medium host for SARS-CoV-2, with 99% genetic similarity between the CoV and SARS-CoV-2 found in the cat eaten.
However, the 1% gap between the two genomes is still a large gap, so concrete evidence is awaiting for conclusive conclusions (Figure 33).
The physiological properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive for up to 5 days at 20°C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot be absorbed in ultraviolet radiation and at temperatures of 56°C after 30 minutes, and that other sedimentary solvents other than ethers, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acids, chloroforms and chlorhexidine can effectively naynate it.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there are no extensive studies on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, specifically: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, when a virus attacks a host, its first pattern is identified by recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lactine-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus triggers the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and type I interference (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and increases the rate of viral antigen macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the N proteins of SARS-CoV may help the virus to prevent immune response.
Soon, the immune response is aligned with the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokineses that are inflammatory to help the rescue cells.
However, by incorporating apoptosis of T cells, the COV T cells can inhibit function.
Humoric immunity, which includes components and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies from several previous cases have been found to have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the over-reaction of the immune system produces large groups of locally free cells that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and can lead to organ damage and even death in bad conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 infection initiated in the group is more likely to occur in older people with co-morbidity and pregnant women.
Individuals who have other diseases or have a compromised immune system are more likely to get the disease than others.
The estimated average warming period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with the majority of cases being 3-7 days, as seen in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average heating period was 3 days and was between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study shows that the warming period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days in the population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for healthcare authorities to coordinate effective quarantine periods based on the most accurate warming period, so that infected but symptom-free people can be prevented from infecting others with the virus.
As a general rule, people who have come into contact with the virus or are infected with it should be kept in isolation for a maximum of 14 days.
Is the quarantine period necessary for 24 days?
Fever is the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, diarrhea, muscle tightness, nausea, headache, throat itching, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, diarrhea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxia within a week of their illness.
In severe cases, patients are immediately diagnosed with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever need to be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, whether or not there is a pulmonary imaging abnormality.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspenia 55%, and diarrhea 3%, and 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Two recent studies on a family group and a group of individuals with no symptoms have found similar findings.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspenia (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation assistance, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and MERS was more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat itching (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspenia (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat itching (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and nearly 14-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases had reached 66,576, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
In comparison, the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases based on a demographic study in June 2012.
Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a higher RO of 6.47 and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV had a RO of between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and RO is given in Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The mass start often started in the same family or with the same ceremony or with the same vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected persons or in the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms and recovered patients who have been discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, which has been warned to extend the period of isolation.
In the initial stage, the normal or decreasing number of patients consists of peripheral white blood cells (especially: lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with lymphocytes < 4×109/L including lymphocyte count < 1×109/L and advanced amino transferase levels and viarremia.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients had increased, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocytes layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the fibrin degradation product in the blood had increased levels of D-dimer and the lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
Most COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid storage and progressive deep intensity affect air exchange.
Type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes decrease surface levels and increase surface tension, thus reducing lung transmission and increasing the risk of lung damage.
So, the worst radiographic results are often the most serious illnesses.
The first diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that the desquamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of an antigenic membrane and the penetration of the central lymphocyte and the multicellular sensory cells in the lungs of the patient who died from the disease are compatible with the diagnosis of viral infection and ARDS and are similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate accelerating the pandemic, medical manifestations for diagnosis were introduced in China on February 13, 2020 (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation started to arise with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, medical disclosure, laboratory testing and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, which uses a depstick to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microllitre of input) within one hour without the need for extensive tools.
It is hoped that if validated in medical samples, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with the new COVID-19, physicians can provide only supporting care to COVID-19 patients and can test using various treatments previously used or proposed on other COVIDs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments including antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients who have been infected, Chinese medicine and mental health support.
Not only that, but the cells of many patients were also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are making rapid efforts to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys to some extent.
Thus, respiratory failure and malfunction pose a high risk to patients and is a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is needed to relieve symptoms and save lives, including regular oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for fatal cardiac or respiratory system failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock and protecting the functioning of the major organs, treatment and functioning of the major organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been found that in SARS and MERS patients, an additional immune system response is affected by cytokine storms.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines that includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free molecules that are a major cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression therapies for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response, IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, Blenetumomab, suppressors of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in SARS treatments to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can lead to serious side effects, particularly: vascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect diagnosis.
However, short-term treatment of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses is recommended for use with caution for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir was found to be effective when administered via vein to a COVID-19 patient in the US.
Remdesivir, originally developed by Gilled to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses, is an extraordinary antiviral drug.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential blockages for other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Depending on this, Zilled supplied the ingredients to China for testing on patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricetinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with Lupivaari/Ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effects of these treatments on other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma and antibodies are produced from many patients.
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients with multiple infectious diseases to treat patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that in many patients, the blood counts are higher than in those of the pathogens.
The antibodies to fight pathogens and other foreign substances are immunoglobulins (IGs) produced by B lymphocytes that identify specific molecules in pathogens and directly destroy them.
Based on this, cells were collected from the blood of a large group of patients from COVID-19 and 10 patients with severe illnesses were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammation and viral pressure and improved oxygen transmission in the blood.
However, validation and clarification for widespread use is required until specific treatments are developed.
At the same time, some of the disadvantages associated with cells for therapeutic effects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can highly stimulate the immune response and can lead to cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal in its toxic form.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells is high to treat a seriously ill patient.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies at a fast pace to fight the global pandemic.
It is therefore important and practical to separate B cells from a large number of patients and identify the genetic codes that encode the effective antibodies or test the effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula according to the TCM theory of disease diagnosis.
Most of the influencing factors are unknown or uncertain because such factors or their highest combinations are difficult to draw and verify.
Due to the lack of effective and specific treatment methods for COVID-19, TCM has become an alternative treatment option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have experienced severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do Capsules and Lian Hua King Wen Capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
The highest recovery rates among 87% of patients using TCM for COVID-19 treatment were seen in various provinces of China including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%) while Hubei Province saw the lowest recovery rates (13%) where only 30% of COVID-19 patients were using TCM.
However, this is a somewhat cumbersome comparison because other impact factors such as patient numbers and severity should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boly Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) only with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time to reverse body temperature, to disappear symptoms, and to be hospitalized was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic growth (mild to severe) was much lower in WM+TCM alone than in WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate in WM+TCM group was also lower than in WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, large-scale gold-controlled testing is required in more centres for the effectiveness and safety of TCM.
It would be somewhat odd to specify the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combination.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience a highly contagious or fatal illness, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to anxiety and depression.
During the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there were reports of persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mood swings, unpleasant symptoms, delusions and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people even more anxious about infection, isolation and guilt among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
The mental base includes the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health group, regular and clear dialogue on accurate news and treatment plans on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, use of commercial power tools and use of applications to avoid close contact with others.
An effective vaccine is required to break the chain of transmission from the virus stockpile in animals and the infected human to the susceptible host, and it can often be used effectively for antiviral treatment to control an outbreak caused by an emerging virus.
Efforts are underway to develop a protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and beneficial antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-degraded vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, the vaccine candidates who were vaccinated before the start of the medical study have not yet been able to identify the physical performance and lethal challenge patterns and protective factors against animal-borne viral infections in adults.
This may be because the effects of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the emergence of smallpox cases and some collective cases of MERS in the Far East and the spread to other regions have shown that animal-borne resources exist in the epidemic region.
Vaccination policies for MERS were developed using ineffective viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microorganisms, viruses, and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the challenge is challenging because it takes a long time (average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and a dynamic variation of the CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just started to show its full course of treatment in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also linked to high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare organizations need to set priorities for their services, especially in resource-free areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be related to or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients aged over 50 years with COVID-19 were aged between 30-65.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (51 vs. 66 in the middle age), suggesting that age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Co-morbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require hypertherapy are more likely to suffer from severe heart disease and dysfunction.
Heart disease was also one of the leading causes of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind ACE-2 positive colangiosites, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the relationship between age and current diseases is important and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are a potential long-term diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
CRP levels have also been linked to the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alpine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially: the heart and liver and tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional spectators of heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient increase in medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other problems to build conclusions and predictions of complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used as adjunctive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
The widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in SARS patients has led to many survivors suffering from severe acute osteoarthritis, including lifelong disability and reduced life expectancy.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients suffered from additional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak because they had to live in isolation and very uncertain conditions for a long time and witnessed the deaths of family members and companions.
Providing mental counseling and long-term support is essential so that they recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic are different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 recurrence can occur more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract and may not cause mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, as other CoVs that can cause colds.
Thus, infected patients in the early stages or retention period can generate large amounts of viruses during daily activities, which can make it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection is believed to spread, while most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
Large-scale efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing and this seems to be causing a decrease in the epidemic.
The most optimistic prediction is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter, predicts that COVID-19 which is more contagious than SARS will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set a pattern to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a patient's mid-turbinate and throttle swab released from the hospital 2 weeks after recovering from the disease, suggesting that the newly identified virus may come in a cyclic chain like influenza.
However, the declining number of new cases is showing promising signs from China, which is showing a positive impact on current policies.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would cause a million cases and five million deaths.
However, due to strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken to ineffectiveness and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with contaminated material by the virus.
The virus has also been detected in the bladder, which has increased the possibility of infection from the bladder to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been caused by hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, very careful care is required to protect people, especially: healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and not only third parties who come into contact with sick or infected people.
The first safety step to reduce the risk of infection is to use face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) both help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid points from passing from the air to the surface of the material from potentially infecting individuals, so that they do not infect others.
However, only the N95 (series #1860) mask can stop the respiration of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses able to enter completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the cell can be accessed through five surgical masks with one on each, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series #1860) without the use of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must also wear a fit insulation gauntlet to avoid contact with the virus.
Viruses can infect people even through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should use transparent face covering or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions have been seen as effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, it is the same-sex variant of SARS-CoV, the 2003 SARS outbreak should have sounded the alarm in China.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was telling people that the new virus is less contagious and less reproducible from humans to humans and that it is not difficult to repel and control the disease.
This message greatly diminished the sense of caution among the people, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring and the crucial time to keep the disease at a minimum in Wuhan was missed.
The disease control institutions in China can learn from this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take further precautions (1) to be more careful in making public announcements as every word spoken to citizens is important and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) to be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) to impose more restrictions to prevent potential disease at an early stage rather than to comfort the public; and (4) to issue targeted and effective drills from time to time to increase public awareness of the disease and to test and improve the patient response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started in late December 2019.
Within two months of writing this, it had spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak created a feeling that SARS is back.
However, there is a significant gap between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important for controlling TB and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 infects patients without symptoms, SARS infects patients only after they become seriously ill, making it much harder to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered from the virus can become positive again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
This rapid progress in research on COVID-19 has not addressed many key issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homosexuality was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like COVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the virus.
Which animal was the medium species to transmit the virus from the original host, the caterpillar or humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and #2, we cannot effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never return.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluation showed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway cells and then make diagnostic changes?
Does the virus bind ACE-2 expression cells to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does a virus genetically evolve in humans during infection?
Will it be a global epidemic, will it end up like SARS, or will it continue to come like the flu?
The answers to the above and many other questions are necessary, but they may take some time.
However, no matter what happens, we have no choice but to get the disease out of our system as quickly as possible and normalize our lives.
The origin of the human coronavirus is animal disease.
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its nutrients with humans has been fueled by mutations and adaptations.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses like the common cold.
The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown how devastating and deadly HCoV infection is.
The coronavirus resurfaced in Central China in late 2019 with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and we were surprised by its high infectiousness, but its pathogenicity was lower than its counterpart SARS-CoV.
HCV infection is an animal disease and therefore it is important for us to understand the origin of HCV.
Most HCoVs are derived from weeds where they are nonpathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to contain parasitic veins.
Identification of animal feed for human disease prevention can have a direct impact.
Research into the interaction of the covid-positive in animals could shed light on important information about the human pathogen.
In this review, we are presenting an overview of the existing information on seven HCoVs, which is focused on their discovery history as well as their animal disease origin and intercellular transmission.
The important thing is that we compare different HCOVs from the point of view of viral development and genome reintegration.
The current COVID-19 outbreak 2019 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful change of diet and the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease has also been emphasized.
Coronavirus (COV) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of inflammatory, positive-sensing, single-stranded RNA viruses.
Viruses that host the largest genome of these RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kB, are called "COVs" because they look like crowns under an electron microscope.
Structurally, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicas polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, which are assigned NSP1-16 in order.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleoproteins (n).
Numerous genealogy-specific ancillary proteins are also encoded by different genealogies of COV.
The COVs are classified into four generations (Alpha-COV, Beta-COV, Gamma-COV, and Delta-COV) according to different protein sequences, of which the Beta-COV generation contains the highest HCOVs and is divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as the genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main masks for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, COVID has been continuously overcoming the barriers of species and has emerged as a major human pathogen.
As of today, there are seven known human COVs.
Among them are HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63, which are Alpha-COV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are usually caused by mild symptoms such as colds and/or cough.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing a relatively high incidence of acute respiratory infections in patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extraplumonic manifestations.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E variant, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which produce self-limiting symptoms.
So, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely believed that HCoV infections were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people with an estimated 10% of the crude cases fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak (MERS) resulted in a continuous epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread rapidly to the rest of the world.
The new HCoV (2019-NCOV) which was later renamed as SARS-CoV-2 was the catalyst for the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had caused over 3,120 deaths and infected over 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing constantly and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs are caused by a disease in rodents, mice, or pets.
Various evidence supports the theory that the origin of the virus is from the parasites, which have taken over the condition and show extraordinary genetic diversity, not pathogenic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the animal disease of ACV reveals the natural history, driving force and constraint structure behind the species jump.
It will also provide guidance or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 host, intermediate and propagating parasite (V) parasites, which can play a key role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal diseases, interspecies infections and pathogenicity of HCoV.
Specifically: We focus on the following common themes and discuss how the parent HCoV virus is not normally pathogenic in its natural parasite litter but becomes pathogenic when interspecies infection occurs in new litter.
We also reviewed the art of HCoV evolution, which is that if infectiousness increases, pathogenicity decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal COVID has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first detection of HCoV-229E from the nasal secretion of a cold patient, B814 was isolated from various infected animals including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCOVs have been identified in the last decades.
A brief summary of the HCOV findings in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently increased from that to WI-38 lung cell lines.
HCoV-229E infected patients showed symptoms of cold including headache, itching, coughing and itching, and fever and coughing in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture of small mice and then from the serial passage in the brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, which cannot be distinguished from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally spread and are mainly infected during the winter in low temperature environments.
In general, the boiling period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study on human volunteers, mild colds have developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, known as "Atipic pneumonia", was the first properly documented global contagious HCoV in human history and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
SARS resulted in 774 deaths, including 8,096 reported cases spread across several countries and continents.
It is estimated that, apart from the hypertransmitters, each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a boiling period of four to seven days, and the peak of the virus's impact can be seen on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV can initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, cough and cold, followed by difficulty breathing, cough and then breathing problems.
Cell damage, liver function tests and increased creatine kinases are common abnormalities found in SARS laboratories.
Diffuse alveolar damage, accumulated cell growth and increased macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
An estimated 20-30% of patients then require ultrasound and mechanical ventilation.
Along with the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also become infected with this serious disease, often causing cytokine storms, which can be especially fatal for patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, unlimited efforts have been made for HCOV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found in large numbers in young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised immune systems.
HCV-NL63 illnesses are commonly associated with colds, dizziness, fever, and respiratory distress.
Another independent study in the Netherlands described the same virus as being isolated from the nasal effusion of an eight-month-old baby with pneumonia.
Although it was found in the Netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and is most prevalent in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an inhibitory colitis also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and respiratory problems.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma disorder, including community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory disease.
HCoV-NKU1, like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, is also found worldwide to cause mild respiratory illness.
All four of these communally transmitted HCoVs have been successfully accepted in humans and are less likely to develop into highly pathogenic diseases, although unknown causes may also lead to accidents, as happened in more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have been reported as recently as causing acute respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs become capable of being effectively infected and persistently in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012 who had severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, close contact has led to the occasion of secondary import cases in various European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The curative signs of Mars are similar to those of SARS, which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered severe renal failure, which is very unusual for MERS in HCV-related diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients with symptoms of digestive disorders, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, were diagnosed.
As of February 14, 2020, there were over 2,500 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humanity.
Between mid-to-late December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients associated with the previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-related respiratory infection as a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
It is noteworthy that the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, compared to 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that are characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also developed hypertension.
Pneumonia was one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly increase the symptoms of severe respiratory pain.
Although the high nucleotide sequence is very similar due to homogeneity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they are branched into different phylogenetic structures.
So, SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Patients with no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to six other HCoVs shows a large number of similarities and differences.
First, the boiling time and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and HCoVs from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is showing features that are commonly seen during infection with HCoV, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even though the rate is low, there is a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the curious patterns of both community-derived HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the HCoVs that are received from the community.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission rate in humans decreases, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 decreases the transmission rate.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also appear in the spleen samples.
It is to be seen from future studies whether the Sars-CoV-2 orally transmission plays a role similar to Sars-CoV in at least some cases.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, as with the community-based HCoV cases.
However, after human transmission, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including infectiousness, pathogenicity and persistent human transmission will be effective for the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
HCOVs, which are derived from all four of the mildly symptomatic communities, are well adapted to humans.
In another way, it may also be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both of them may have survived the ancient HCoV.
To eliminate the serious human disease-causing HCoV and the serious human-caused HCoV.
To achieve this, HCOV should be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to accumulate a favorable mutation that will defeat the inhibitory factors of the nutrient.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its spread among humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
For years, four community-based COVID infections have been spreading among humans, causing people with weakened immune systems to catch a cold.
These viruses do not need animal shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans properly and their human transmission will not be permanent.
They need to maintain and spread their animal shelters and spread to sensitive human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying nutrients as possible.
The features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs that are community-based.
At least for now, it's just as contagious as community-borne HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will be fully adapted to humans without shelter or intermediate animal feed and it remains to be seen if they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it would be appropriate to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, shelter, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoV.
An animal can become a habitat for the evolution of HCoV if it has sheltered a closely related ancestor that shares a high homogeneity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
In these cases, the ancestral viruses are often adaptive and non-pathogenic.
Similarly, parasitic feedingstuffs provide a continuous and long-term shelter for HCoVs.
In both cases, the pathogen is naturally infected and the pathogen is naturally infected with HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is placed in a mediated host just before or during introduction to humans, it does not adapt to new clothing and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediate proteins can then act as animal proteins for human transmission and can act as a promoter proteins to allow the virus to reproduce transiently and then transmit to humans to extend the range of human transmission.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it cannot maintain its infection in the median line.
In contrast, HCoVs can accept moderate diets and not only establish long-term immunity.
In this case, the median nutrient becomes the natural parasite nutrient.
The epidemiological data has unveiled with anticipation that the history of contact of the first SARS case with predators has been revealed.
Subsequent CeroPrivalence research showed that anti-SARS-CoV-IGG prevalence was higher among animal traders than among the general population.
In the live animal market, masked palm seeds (Pugma larvae) and raccoon dogs were first identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all the Swede in the market.
However, it was also reported that the masked palm seeds in the forest or fields that have not been exposed to live animal markets are negative for most SARS-CoVs, suggesting that the masked palm seeds may be intermediate enhancement proteins but not a natural refuge for SARS-CoVs.
It is noteworthy that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so there is no denying the possibility that different species of small mammals may also be acting as intermediate enhancers for SARS-CoV.
These are all seen as the ultimate costumes of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research into the natural animal nutrition of SARS-CoV has led to the discovery of a closely related rhinovirus COV, called SARS-related rhinoplasty bat COV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-batCoV-HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe rhinovirus.
These worms are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
And these other parasites share a common nucleotide sequence homogeneity of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that weeds feed the developing human pathogens.
Several SARS-like covid-19s have been identified from strains, but none other than WIV1 have been identified as living viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was derived from a sample of the vaginal cavity that was shown to be used as a graphite for vaginal, suction and human ACE2 non-cell entry.
Interestingly, the blood of the SARS patient who had recovered from the disease was able to neutralize WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in the strains, which share 95% of the nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although there is high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the median parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that the parasites are not immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genealogical analysis combines MERS-CoV into a similar group as COV-HKU4 and BAT COV-HKU5.
The carcinogens COV-HKU4 and MERS-COV are used to enter the virus by grafting dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4).
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of Mars-CoV is historically closest to the patterns found in Bat Beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild grasshoppers.
Merce-CoV and its closely related bat-CoV-HKU25 have only 87 percent nucleotide sequence homogenization.
Thus, it is likely that the wormholes are not an immediate parasite of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to certain non-communicable MERS-CoV antigens, as camels of Middle Eastern descent are found in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV is similar to a virus found in humans that was isolated from the snake in the nose of a dromedary camel, further indicating that camels act as beneficiary parasitic nutrients of MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that a large number of viral experimental methods, which were generally mild in nature, have been used to determine that MERS-CoV has taken refuge in infected camels.
Notably, infected camels provide shelter to the viruses not only through respiration but also through the mouth-to-mouth route, which is also a major route of shelter from the virus from vaginosis.
However, the question remains that in many confirmed cases of MERS, there is no history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, a human-to-human transmission pathway or an unknown transmission pathway in which unknown animal species that shelter MERS-CoV are likely to be caused.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with batCoV RATG13 which is separated from Rhinolopus-related varicose veins.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG-13 are very good for determining parental relationships.
This means that the bats are unlikely to be an immediate parasite of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
The intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the early cases related to COVID-19 being speculative of the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Numerous recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small critically endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis Jovanica - eaten cat) may also be a haven for SARS-CoV-2-related ancestor beta-CoVs.
These new Pangolin COV genomes share a homogeneity of 85-92% nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 in approximately 90% homogeneity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They grouped the variants SARS-CoV-2 into two sub-branches in the genealogical tree, one of which shared a more similar graphite-like mortgage domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence identification.
In the paradox of the undeniable truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more diverse, but there is a high proportion of genome-wide homogeneity sequences.
Recent research on disease pangolin has also reported viral layers on a lung sample, which were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The research adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to produce a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that one of the intermediate animal proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is Pangolin.
However, due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin's SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence available to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a direct pangolin.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin's SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the highest sequence homogenization was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homogenization.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high degree of similarity between the Pangolin's SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and the selectively drug-laced RBD of SARS-CoV-2 carried by co-evolutionary agents.
There is an alternative proposal in the benefits of re-breeding between the Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and the third wildlife species RATG13.
As the driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoV.
The jury is still investigating the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Even with high levels of pathogenic HCoV, animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
The genealogical evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are derived from both variants of the fecal fluid, while HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 is the parent virus found in rodents.
It has been reported that the COV from the appendix was found in ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) North American triangular appendix, showing a close association with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomally related to another varicose vein COV, called Hipposiderosis/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, at the same time that camels were suspected of being their mediator nutrients.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV has been presented through genealogical analysis throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic livestock to infect humans around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was reported.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is very poorly understood.
Bat alpha-CoV has been identified as closely related to HCoV-229E.
One of them is Alpha-COV.
There is a lot of evidence supporting the direct transmission of the virus to humans since the time of the virus.
First, it is likely that humans, not alpacas, were exposed to weeds in a shared environment.
Instead, humans are more closely connected to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related strains are distinct and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV strains, while alpacas alpha-CoV has been implicated in the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpacas alpha-CoV has not been found in the wild.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas have HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, the worms are direct sources of human pathogens including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
So it is no surprise that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is a genetic stock of HCoV-229E, with alpacas and dromedary camels acting as intermediate carriers that can transmit viruses to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has been the best example of interspecies transmission in humans from camel to camel and from camel to camel.
The evolutionary origin of Mars-CoV from the fossil record is known for its early identification and has been further reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that the caterpillars provide a rich stock of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated settlements, close social interaction and flight capability all make the parasites the model for the transmission of the virus.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for decades.
These camels have taken them well which has made them stable and natural parasitic feed from intermediate feed.
MERS-CoV is a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The small number of human infections is an accident, and humans are living in the grip of MERS-CoV because their infection is not permanent.
The role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission is different from, if anything, the role of the pangolin in the SARS-CoV-2 encounter.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic to pangolin.
They may be a step-by-step guide to SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV cases.
Future research should consider or reject the numerous possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, the worms may be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are very similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with the slaughter or through the coal mines.
Second, pangolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients that have recently been identified for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Human exposure to viruses is caused by slaughterhouses and eating prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Pet and wildlife surveys are required for the antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in a third species that are exposed to caterpillars and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal feed, there are three main factors that are important in the COVID virus's support in facilitating the crossing of the other species barrier.
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of COV depends on the stage of adoption of the new covid, with an average replacement rate of -10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year, which can be considered as "moderate" to "high".
The COV has a proof-reader exoribonuclease, which removal results in high levels of mutation being overcome and degraded or even viability.
Surprisingly, nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to replicate COV to suppress the inhibition of these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the rate of mutation of COVs is about a million times higher than their nutritional rate.
Furthermore, when COVs are not well received by the diet, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower mutation rate, indicating a high level of acceptance by humans.
It may have been adopted by other clothing that is close to humans.
As an addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well received by the drone kites.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic hijacking will make the ineffectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and condition-viral.
Second, large RNA genomes in CVOs extra flexibility in gene modification to mutation and recombination, thus increasing the possibility of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CVO when conditions are right.
It is supported by many other open readable frames and protein activity encoded at the end of the genome at 3'
Third, COVs switch templates between RNA replicas randomly and frequently through a "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the gut, they act as mixing vessels, with frequent strand switching occurring during the transcription of COV RNA.
High-volume homogeneous full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be reconstituted to produce new COVs.
The genetic evidence for natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal COVs such as the woolly SL-CoV and the woolly COV-HKU9.
The interaction between the virus and the host in relation to infection
In addition to the three viral aspects mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient recipient is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a sample example, which also shows evidence of positive selection among interspecies transmission incidents.
Based on comparative analysis of differentiators between humans and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adopted in different diets, especially with the RBD mutation of S protein.
In general, in RBDs in S protein, COV interacts with the cellular receptor and is actively selected by the antibody response of the nutrient.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are found on the S1 axis in the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to the human ACE2 as well as to the recipients for viral access.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows for interspecies transmission of viruses that can identify ACE2 recipients from various animals, including caterpillars, bats, mice and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were found to be distinct in the RBD of human and civet virus separators, and four of them are located in the receptor-bond pattern for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In civil SARS-CoV, the K489N and S487T mutants are in their RBDs, which can amplify the desire for spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, replacing these two amino acids could be crucial in human viral reception.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein suggests that their S protein's binding desire with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Of course, a Cryo-EM study showed that the desire for these hostages is 10 to 20 times greater than the hostage between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether there is a need for any other co-receiver for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 should also be more likely to be associated with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are numerous other HCV grains, such as amino peptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully transmitting this covid to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal feed.
In addition to cellular grafts, the effects of interspecies transmission of HCoV are also controlled by other nutrient dependencies and preventive factors.
The dispersion of this nutrient protein between humans and natural cumulative nutrients of HCoVs such as woolly worms, dromedary camels and rats can interfere with interspecies transmission.
For a successful cross-species transmission of HCV, nutrient dependency factors must be strengthened and nutrient inhibitors must be upset.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of this important viral-nutrient interaction are yet to be identified and their characteristics determined.
Using CRISPR's state-of-the-art technology for SARS-CoV-2 can be useful for non-biased analysis of nutrient dependent genomic and inhibitory factors.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Going back to zero
The diversity of COVs of the decomposition provides a lot of opportunities for the emergence of new HCOVs.
Thus, the woolly covid is used as a genetic reserve for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reintegration also lead to HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or destruction of new protein-coding genes has the power to completely alter viral imagery.
Among SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human reception, as SARS-CoV-related strain of the virus is isolated but is found encoding abnormal ORF8 proteins.
The gene pool that was isolated at the start of the disease in humans has been characterized by the removal of the 29-nucleotide of SARS-CoV.
Since it is removed, ORF8 divides ORF8a and ORAP8B and is considered an acceptable mutation, which promotes nutrient migration.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the genealogy of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which contain a large number of small recombinant RNAs.
These reintegration sites were also identified in NSP 9, most NSP10, and parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that MERS-CoV has been experiencing reproductive events in different strains, which have been observed in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the phenomena of re-combination have been reported in other HCoVs, where HCoVs re-combine with other animal COVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to unwanted changes in the virus genome, which often free the virus from the selective pressure applied by the immune system of the nutrient.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype genome, which causes the deletion of the two-nucleotides.
A group ORF4 can be found in HCOC-229E-related strains of the worm and camel virus, denoting the inclusion of alpha-CoV single nucleotide, which results in frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by selective pressures in their parasitic habits.
The immediate or only mild symptoms were detected when the vaginans were infected with the covid, which indicates mutual acceptance between the covid and vaginans.
It seems that the vaginists have been well-administered to COV through physical strength and physical activity.
For example, a defect in activating the pre-exposure response in the vagina reduces the effectiveness of the pathology being implemented by the COV.
In addition, the upward regulation of the natural marker cell activity in the wound is suppressed by the upward regulation of the natural marker cell grahi NKG2/CD94 and the low expression of the major tissue compound class I molecule.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of the worms both suppress the COV replication activity and result in pre-friction by the exoribonuclease, thus when new nutrients are introduced, the genealogy of the virus provides selective pressure to become highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic CVD strains also evolved into re-synthesis, which led to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to absorb nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not been accidentally created in the last two decades.
These covids cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic diet, such as wolves or camels.
These strongly-coated proteins produce replications without removing the immune response.
The secret is hidden as to why the carrier is present and what is causing the serious problem in human infection.
Symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, while where the immune response is stronger, more severe lung damage appears to occur.
In contrast, in the carrier, the immune response is deployed from covid replication.
This is a useful strategy for breaking the immune response in the case of SARS-CoV-2 anti-vaccination.
Interferon response is particularly strong in the urine.
Thus, management of at least Type I interferons should be beneficial during the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 agent in the wool is defective.
For this reason, the co-sand-man of the NLRP3 transmitter MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern, which results in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Conversely, 95% of the beta-COVs in the WATCOVs were found to share nucleotide homogeny with SARS-CoV, whereas 96% of the nucleotide homogeny in the WATCOVs is also present with SARS-CoV-2.
However, since bats and other animals in the market have been identified as hosts of viruses such as SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate doses for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
The homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 in Pangolin's beta-CoV has been surprisingly found, suggesting that Pangolin may have acted as one of the intermediate nutrients or that Pangolin's beta-CoV may have contributed to genetic hardening in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question remains that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought the COVID-19 back into the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and parasitic nutrients of HCoV in human transmission.
Evidence of spread showed that the origin of the virus is between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and that its transmission to humans was through intermediate clothing.
The SARS-CoV infection was caused by contact between humans and cats in the market, closure of the seafood market and killing of the cats in the market.
For the same reason, given the discovery that multiple strains of Pangolin beta-CoV are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal transmission.
However, future research remains to clarify whether and how SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
It is an important means of transportation for camels and is also a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the locals.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of mercury, as has been done in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, including integration of other infection control measures, should be taken.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new strains of the virus can emerge to cause an outbreak.
There are many different types of animals that live in the wild.
In particular, bat COVs are also very diverse with animal potential.
There are numerous opportunities for these animal-based COVs to evolve and reproduce, resulting in the generation of new, more transmissible and/or lethal forms of COV in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of wildlife eating should be abandoned in some areas of China.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparation and response plan should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although weedlings have many characteristics of spreading viruses, training people to stay away from weeds and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
To better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural habitats, there is a need for continuous monitoring of mammals, which can help prevent human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
To conclude, keeping humans away from the natural nutrient position of the animal virus is the most effective way to prevent animal virus.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle for SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if the caterpillars transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to the pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances the caterpillars and pangolins share the same ecological location.
Second, if the worms played a more direct role in human transmission, humans would have to decide how they came into contact with the worms.
Third, if the third mammal really acted as an intermediate food, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, wolves, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, so they should be monitored and experimentally infected.
If it is a caterpillar, pangolin or other mammal, in the future, their natural diet will be identical to the SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral virus.
Continuous exploration of the region will reveal important insights into the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team has published the Rapid Consultation Guidelines for the Diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and these guidelines have set a good reference for our experience and the fight against the disease worldwide.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is growing gradually based on the research findings and experience of clinical practice that is currently underway, so the diagnosis and treatment strategy is also being continuously updated.
In this letter, a comment is highlighted on our guidelines and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (seventh edition) "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest diagnosis and treatment has been provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) outbreak, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported and the virus was renamed as Civiary Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has characterized COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed Quick Consultation Guidelines and they have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted a lot of attention.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness is growing gradually based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven versions of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (NHC) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have been published with some reference changes.
Now that our guidelines have been commented on by Zhou et al., they have put forward simple scoring proposals based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also provided a valuable reference for this global epidemic.
We celebrate and thank him for his remarkable work.
However, its work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (Test 7th Edition) and recent study.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), confirming a suspected case requires that any one item of a characteristic history of Epidemiology be combined with two items of clinical invention, or if there is no clear history of Epidemiology, that three items of clinical invention be completed.
History of contagion: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and its surrounding areas, or 14 days before symptoms occurred where cases of COVID-19 have been reported; (2) History of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including positive nucleic acid testing); (3) History of contact with cases of Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the previous 14 days of symptoms occurring; or History of contact with patients with symptoms similar to fever, or of confirmed cases of contagion, (such as home office, classroom, school, etc.) in other communities where symptoms have occurred within the previous 14 days of symptoms occurring; or History of contact with patients with confirmed cases, (such as home, office, classroom, etc.) in small cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms ≥ 2 weeks.
Clinical inventions: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) Imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a normal reduction in the total number of white blood cells, or a decrease in the number of lymphocytes, in the early stages.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any one component of pathogenic or serological evidence as provided below: (1) Real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be positive; (2) the entire genetic sequence of known novel coronavirus infections showing high homogeneity; (3) SARS-CoV-2 positive in serum testing for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or a change from negative to positive of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, or a rise in titers ≥4 times in the recovery phase in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including the inclusion of a blood sample from a respiratory tract sample to search for the optimal nucleic acid for this rapid diagnosis, who have increased the availability of different samples, and supported the positive results of specific antibodies in confirmed criteria.
In addition, there was more and more evidence that reminded us to be cautious with the typical symptoms and the unusual patient.
So, Zhou et al. should update their flow chart, because they classify a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and study.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the reader for their comments.
For the diagnosis of suspicious cases and confirmed cases, we must follow and follow the latest guidelines from his/her home country.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a single day.

At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that even if Russians do not go to work, they will continue to receive salaries until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament extended the state of national emergency for 15 days, the resolution passed by 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Devine has extended his stay at home mandate until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the threshold for toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered their ban on their toilet paper purchases to two and one package per transaction respectively nationally.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as messages on the check-out and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are storing them out of fear of COVID-19 and storing them again and again.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited one pack per order for each purchase for home delivery.
The changes come after a four-pack ban on the previous transactions introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 announcement, reported that the four-pack would be restricted, "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery", and said demand was "incredible", while ALDI, on Tuesday, in its Facebook post, called it "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales have been "growing" in the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered large packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability available for the planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the retailer tried to increase inventory but was hampered by local council's time constraints on truck-delivery.
They expect an increase in production costs, as suppliers have to meet demand, and a smaller amount of special needs.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to early delivery of inventory, some stores cannot operate specials on Wednesday.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are filling up stocks every night.
They've been fooled that toilet paper is a big item, leading to a low inventory in numbers, and, when sold, emptying a large amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths pointed out that if you have a lot of stuff on your shelf, like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there's more of it, you'll reduce the likelihood of panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said it ran out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep their supplies running smoothly.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property dealers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the bidder who placed the first bid on its auction, when no auction was held due to buyers having time during the big Labor Day weekend.
In the Thursday edition of NT News, Darwin added eight water inserts to be printed daily, cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, the store was originally opposed to the imposition of restrictions, in which they said they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that there is also a high demand for other products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Ocado restricted its purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global plague.
The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, as a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "global pandemic" refers more to the spread of a disease than to the extent to which certain events are dangerous, WHO has stressed the need for concrete action by governments.
All countries can still change the cash flow of this global pandemic.
If in response, nations recognize it, they test, treat, isolate, withdraw and unite their people in this fight, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are very concerned about the dangerous level of spread and the seriousness and the terrible level of inactivity.
Dr. Tom Freuden, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the global outbreak was "unprecedented".
In comments published in CNN in February, he says, "No other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from the onset of the virus to its global spread".
"We have never seen the global shock caused by the coronavirus before", says Gebreyesus.
He added, "And we have not seen a global warming that can be controlled at the same time".
The current state of the global pandemic follows the decision of WHO in January to declare the outbreak of global concern as a public health emergency.
"It is certain that the situation will get worse", said Dr. Anthony Fossey, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The global outbreak of coronavirus 2019-20 is the global outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 which causes severe respiratory illness.
The outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and became a global epidemic from 11 March 2020.
Nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories as of 10 April 2020, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Almost 3,64,000 people have recovered.
China has an estimated mortality rate of 4%, while Algeria has a global mortality rate of 13.04% and New Zealand has a mortality rate of 0.08%.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhea.
In cases of complications, these symptoms may include pneumonia and severe breathing problems.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments known.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and basic treatment, recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering when coughing, distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation from people suspected of infection.
Officials around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantining, lockdowns, controlling workplace hazards and closing services.
The global pandemic has led to severe socio-economic isolation globally, sports, religious, political and cultural events being postponed or cancelled, and a widespread supply shortage, which has been disrupted by panicked purchases.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed either nationally or locally, and this has affected almost 99.4% of the global student population.
There has been a lot of misinformation about the virus online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and Southeastern ethnicity and people who look like them and live in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.
The decline in travel and heavy industry shutdown have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the wholesale market of seafood in Hunan and therefore the virus is believed to have originated in the animal kingdom.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, the coronaviruses associated with cats and SARS-CoV. The very first known person to have symptoms was later diagnosed as ill on 1 December 2019 and the person was not directly related to the later weight market group.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in 2019 were market related.
An unverified report by the South China Morning Post on March 13, 2020, suggested that this may be the first case of a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province tracked up to November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that as new cases in China decreased but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, for the first time, new cases outside China exceeded those in China.
Cases may have been reported in very low form, especially cases where mild symptoms have been reported.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. According to estimates by Patrick Wallens, chief medical adviser to the United Kingdom, 60% of the British population would need to be infected before attaining a collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive according to official rules.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms.
According to a study published on March 16, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were unaccounted for as of January 23, and undocumented individuals were the source of 79% of the written cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people who have COVID-19 recover.
And the time from symptom onset to death for those who don't, is anywhere from 6 to 41 days, and most of the time it's usually 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, almost 97,000 deaths have been reported from COVID-19.
In China, 80% of deaths as of 5 February were people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic are usually related to deaths that have tested positive for COVID under official regulation.
The actual deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, because it may not include those who are dying in places without testing, for example, at home, in hospitals, etc.
A little bit of information from Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that [the combined death toll] is a low estimate", a statement confirmed by incomplete reports of declining numbers in the U.S. This is a pattern that is often seen in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
More than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica as of March 13.
The figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of healthcare, treatment options, the time since the outbreak and the characteristics of the population; for example, age, gender and overall health.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death-case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
The mortality rate in China decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
This data is not time-bound and it tracks a specific population from the outbreak to the resolution of the case.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate these figures for a specific population.
Based on evidence from the University of Oxford, the Centre for Medicine estimates that the global infection-related death rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate in this category is consistent with the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany and a statistical study that analyses the impact of the tests on CFR.
WHO is confident that this global plague can be controlled.
The maximum level and maximum duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If not tested", notes Macy's Boney of Penn State University, "the outbreak stops at a certain level and decreases as the host available to the disease decreases.
But it's just impossible to make a correct prediction about when that will happen".
Zhong Nanshang, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries start adhering to WHO's recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus, "it will be over by June".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noted that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread for one to two years".
A study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College said that physical distancing and other measures would be "necessary until a vaccine is available (18 months or longer)".
William Shaffner of Vanderbilt University notes that "it is impossible to completely eradicate the virus as it is so easily transmitted", so "it will become a seasonal disease and will likely return every year".
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the collective immunity and extent of the transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not specific and are not likely to be seen in infected people.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms include low fatigue, coughing, lack of breathing sensation, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, swelling, bleeding, diarrhea, or lack of oxygen. WHO states that approximately one in six people suffers from severe illness and respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergencies as symptoms; for example, breathing difficulties, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, pain when standing up and facial or lip bleaching; prompt medical attention is advised if such symptoms occur.
Some of the infected people may not have any symptoms, no medical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so the researchers have advised that those who have come into close contact with people who are confirmed to have been infected should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the possibility of infection.
Chinese estimates that the proportion of those without symptoms can be as low as 44%.
The actual onset of disease (from infection to symptoms) is usually between one and 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, it is estimated that the number of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease may have spread are still being sought.
The disease is mainly caused by close contact and small droplets of coughing, sneezing or speaking, and is believed to spread when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that the drops can travel 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) due to facial cough.
Some have suggested that the tiny droplets that come out of the mouth when speaking can also be transmitted through tiny droplets that can stay in the air for long periods of time. Although the virus does not form in the air, the breathing droplets can form when breathing, when speaking.
These droplets can be passed through the mouth or nose of nearby people or into the lungs with breathing.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the discharge to be thinly sprayed through the air and thus spread through the air.
If a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the intestines, it is considered to be less dangerous.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by mouth or mouth. Although there is a possibility of transmission before and during the next stage of the disease, the virus is most likely to be transmitted within the first three days after symptoms.
People tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms and this suggests that infection can occur even before a large number of symptoms appear.
There are only a few confirmed cases in the lab that show no symptoms, but when looking for contacts, some countries have found infection even if no symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, it can be transmitted from one person to two or three others.
The virus has been found to be particularly prevalent on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on paperboard for a day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this can vary with humidity and temperature. Tests of pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
Although British authorities advise washing hands when contact with other surfaces that infected individuals may have touched, as well as after contact with animals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia in Wuhan, China, related to a group of cases of severe respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. The virus dies outside the human body as its protective shell is dissolved by domestic soap.
It is believed to have originated in the animal kingdom.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genus together with betacoronavirus form a genetic cluster with two strains derived from the genus, the subgenus serbicovirus (lineage B).
Its overall genome level is 96% similar to other bat-related corona virus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between the germs of mosquitoes and parts of the genome sequence of human viruses.
To date, 92% of the genome content shared in the whole genome comparison of the strawberry virus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which is insufficient to prove that strawberries are the intermediate hosts.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected practice.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan suggested that although less accurate, CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and many of its imaging characteristics are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has issued several rules for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a respiratory tract or blood sample.
The results can usually be available in a few hours and days.
The test is usually performed with a sample of excretion from the upper part of the back of the throat, but a sample of excretion from the throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing tests that identify blood-related resistance.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these tests were proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Cellaxney in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Specific image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with no symptoms have unconfirmed peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleural fusion.
International online information on the findings of the imaging of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imaging to detect COVID-19 without PCR confirmation due to its association with infections such as adenoviruses.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that imaging for detecting infections, although less accurate, is faster and more sensitive, and suggested that it should be considered as a screening tool in areas affected by the pandemic.
Convolutional neural networks have been developed with artificial intelligence based radiographs and CT to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
The measures to prevent the spread of this disease include maintaining our overall personal health, washing hands, avoiding unwashed eyes, nose or mouth, using tissue when coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue directly into the trash can.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to maintain physical distance to prevent infection have also been recommended. Many governments have restricted travel from areas where the outbreak has occurred to other areas or advised against travel.
But the virus has reached a social level in large parts of the world.
The meaning of the virus is that it has spread to society and some parts of society do not know when and where they became infected. Healthcare providers who are caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard care, contact care and eye care.
The use of location information by governments for mobile phones has raised concerns about privacy and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement limiting such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use and as of 7 April 2020, a group of over a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in the privacy of a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Then users get a message if they come in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 that there is a misunderstanding about preventing infection, for example, that cleaning the nose and flossing is not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands look dirty to the eyes, before eating and after spitting, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies with domestic soap because domestic soap breaks its protective membranes.
If soap and water are not available, the CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume.
WHO recommends that you do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropenol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% powydone-iodine can remove surface contamination (surface stainless steel can be disinfected with only one minute of disinfectant).
Other solvents such as benzalconia and crohexidine are less effective.
The CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place like a litter or nursery, all tablets, touch screens, remote controls and devices such as ATM machines used by sick people in such areas should be disinfected.
Health agencies have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a twisted corner or tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance of movement of the droplets that are spread by breathing when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask is likely to reduce the inclination of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if their hands are not healthy".
WHO recommends wearing a mask only if they are at risk to healthy people, for example those who are caring for people infected with COVID-19, they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started to encourage masks to the general public.
The CDC recommends the use of unsanitary masks made from textiles in the U.S. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for public health care providers, especially when interacting with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transportation or in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or wearing their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam has asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places, to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going to grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan has been making ten million masks daily since mid-March, and since April 1 passengers are required to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy face masks make them at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical transmission) involves the control of infection actions that aim to minimize the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The measures include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
People can implement social communication by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in the areas where the outbreak has occurred.
The U.S. government agencies and the Department of Health have reduced the maximum number of people coming together from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in the region is not known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people in public places. The CDC advises that older people and those with medical obligations in places of social outbreaks, such as diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, government disorders, hypertension and compromised immune systems, remain at home as they face an increased risk of serious illness and disorder. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies continued to use the term "social distancing" to reduce the use of the term "social distancing" to maintain physical distance or maintain virtual distance while maintaining social relations.
The use of the term "social transmission" has led to people being completely isolated from each other by alternative means rather than encouraging social interaction. Some officials have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
It includes recommendations for having sex with someone you live with and who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who suspect that we have been infected have recommended to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have given proper guidance on how to self-isolate. Many governments have ordered or recommended that the entire population living in areas where the infection is present be quarantined.
The strictest self-exclusion guidelines have been issued for those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who are likely to have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected person and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a large number of cases have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last contact date.
Preventing or preventing the spread and curbing the spread are the measures to control the outbreak.
Prevention of spread is done in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track, isolate those who have been infected, plan for infection control measures and vaccinate against other populations.
When the spread of disease cannot be prevented, steps are taken towards curbing the disease: measures are taken to slow the spread and measures are taken to reduce the impact on health systems and society.
Prevention and reduction of spread can be combined.
To prevent the spread of the disease, there are many measures to reduce the number of basic reproductions to less than 1 and to reverse the global pandemic.
This reduces the risk of stress on healthcare and gives time to develop vaccines and treatments.
The illegal prevention measures that can manage the outbreak may include hand hygiene, face masks and self-isolation, closing schools, banning large gatherings, encouraging and engaging society to recognize and engage in interventions such as social measures aimed at physical distancing, as well as personal preventive measures such as cleaning surfaces related to the surrounding environment.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has started extensive testing and local quarantine and has warned to remain vigilant about the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to those who self-isolated and punished those who could not.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and sanctioned the stockpiling of medical supplies. Imitating Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in curbing the spread (slowing down the spread of the epidemic, not stopping it) and containment (reversing the spread of the epidemic).
The positive measures to reduce the spread of disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by two thirds and reduce deaths by half but still can lead to thousands of deaths and create tremendous strain on health systems.
Prevention or suppression of transmission may be preferred, but it is necessary to maintain it continuously as long as the virus is spreading to the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if it has happened before), otherwise the infection strain will spread again after measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to prevent or suppress the spread of pandemics has led to economic and social losses.
There are no specific antiviral medicines that are certified for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them that include testing of available medicines.
Taking cold medicines, taking fluids, and taking rest, which are readily available in medical stores, can help to reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, vein fluid and respiratory support can be felt as intense.
Steroid use can make the effects worse.
Several compounds that have been previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that "traditional and home remedies" could relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Capacity building and optimizing healthcare for COVID-19 patients is the key to responding to the outbreak, WHO said.
The European Division Office of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines to take available resources for hospitals and primary healthcare to various levels including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling alternative methods if possible, separating patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and increasing their hyperactivity through training and staffing and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many theories about where the first case (called a zero-number patient) was found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced to Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
The link was mostly to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or in other words the virus was originally an animal. A group of pneumonia patients with unknown causes were found on December 26 and were being treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jixian, who informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Eight doctors, including Lee Wenling, were warned by police about spreading false rumors, and another, Mother Fan, was strongly warned by her superiors about such a warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed WHO.
Numerous unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities, which led to an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling roughly every seven and a half days.
The virus spread to other provinces of China in early and mid-January 2020 due to migration due to the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being a major hub of transportation and a major junction for railway switching.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data indicate that 6174 people had already started to show symptoms as of 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the world in terms of the most confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97000 people have died and more than 364000 have recovered.
At least one case has been reported in nearly 200 countries and regions.
As a result of the global outbreak in Europe, many Schengen countries have imposed restrictions on free movement and border controls.
National responses include measures to contain the spread (home orders, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns) and lockdowns. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, which increased to 2.6 billion in two days - a figure that's a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan before 1 December 2019, with an unconfirmed case detected on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital reported it to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of a sample of patients on December 27 showed the presence of a coronavirus like SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to the public.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
As the warning incident happened, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to spread false rumors about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In the late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that the Chinese Communist Party's General Secretary, Xi Jinping, later described as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
Described as "the largest isolation in human history", the sanitation chain was announced on January 23, which stopped traveling in and out of Wuhan, which was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.

The technology industries have been warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanam, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.

This has also created a global shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that this could put health workers at risk.
The pandemic in Australia has given Daigu shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This has led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequent bans by the Australian government. Despite high COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, and high demand for upcoming food products, both sections have survived severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the illegal trade in stocks and essential goods have been successful, and thus avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not experienced much decline, but industry representatives say prices may rise.
While the empty containers of foodstuffs in the store were also temporary in Wuhan, Chinese officials opened pork stores for adequate population nutrition.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which requires food producers to reserve food for such an emergency.

Another type of disease that is currently being rapidly shut down is the cancellation of religious services, sports events and other musical events and concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the observance of the religious week in Rome, which is the last week of the Christian Lent, is being canceled.
Many bishops' jurisdictions have asked the faithful to stay at home instead of coming to Sunday prayers, with some churches offering church services via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others offering a drive-in worship option.
While the territory under the authority of the Roman Catholic bishop of Rome has closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square has been empty without devotees, other religious institutions have also closed services and restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran cancelled Friday's prayer outbreak in the area and closed it after midday, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a massive disruption to the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Several important sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak has disrupted the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker games have been postponed or canceled.
This has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups to many online gambling sites. Many musical groups have postponed or canceled their concert tours, which has also affected the entertainment industry.
Many big theaters like Broadway have postponed their experiment.
Some artists have found ways to create art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations and continue to share it, such as creating live performances of concerts or web-based "festivals" to present, distribute and publish their work to artists.
There are many online internet memes about the coronavirus that are spreading, many of which are meant to create and distract humor in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a growing xenophobia, intense prejudice and racism against the Chinese people and the East Asian region as well as those in hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
In particular, there have been reports of fears, suspicions and hostility in many countries in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February report (when most cases were still confined to China), records were made of ethnic sentiment among groups around the world that Chinese people were receiving what was reported as a virus outbreak or a justified retaliation.
Anti-China sentiment has also been increasing in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have noted discrimination based on their regional origin.
There is support for the Chinese people and the people of the affected areas both online and offline.
People in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak after the spread of the outbreak in new hotspots, may also have been subject to suspicion and xenophobia.People in other countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined together to sign petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, #ChinaDownTwoJapan has also become a hot topic on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in England and the United States have reported increasing incidents of racism and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from North East India who come from China's border areas and study in important Indian cities have reportedly been persecuted in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
State-level President of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "God took their revenge".
The Chinese Embassy in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them "defective". Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have been fueled by the pandemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal".
Current mail with paywall has removed some or all of the paywall for their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific research on the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists have chosen a way to share their results quickly on a preprint server like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus and detect the antibodies produced in the response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is verified by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and is designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to ensure a very recent or active infection.
Antibiotic testing (cerology) can be used for both diagnosis and close population monitoring.
Antibiotic tests show how many people have the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or those without symptoms.
The results of these tests can determine the exact mortality rate and the level of immunity of the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable information on the spread of the virus among its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference between countries in the amount of testing.
This variability is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported mortality rate, which is also likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
As a result, they are usually available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR testing of throat lumps is only valid in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and its numbers in the lungs continue to grow rapidly.
Alternatively, a sample from deep airways can be taken by suction catheter or a coughing agent (thunky) can be used to test infected individuals in the second week.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the foundation of 250,000 test kits made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector kit (Powercheck Coronavirus).
The test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and an RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector kit in China.
One in three of the older versions of the test kits resulted in a genetic test fault resulting in indecisive outcomes and a disruption to the testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples being successfully processed on average every day throughout February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, two-factor testing was not considered valid, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.
On 5 March 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No quantity limits were declared; sampling and processing should be done in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
The COVID-19 test was developed and developed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Vector in Russia.
The test was registered by the Federal Service for monitoring healthcare on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a large-scale test that can be done in 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's M2000 system; similar authorization was previously granted by the FDA to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermophiser Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, SafeFid received the EUA for a similar test from the FDA in approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can give a fixed result in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently, there are an estimated 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A monoclonal antibiotic test that specifically binds the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan, and is expected to produce the same results as a rapid influenza test in 15 to 20 minutes.
In March 2020, a data release concluded that "Chest X-rays are less useful for early diagnosis, while CT [computed tomography] findings may appear before symptoms begin".
The typical features of CT include a secondary irregular lateral distribution with bilateral multibar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, crazies and integration develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the current pandemic's origin point has suggested that although PCR is less specific, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR as it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes along with its many imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used as a first-in-class test for testing or diagnosis of COVID-19 as a priority". CDC recommends PCR for initial testing by March 2020.
The immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
The tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor population, either in a Central Laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (POCT) approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms.
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test a large number of automated systems developed by certain processes over a specific period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although multiple samples can be used to track immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
For POCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction is required before testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 agents who gave the agency instructions as needed and therefore were able to deliver their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IGA antibodies against a virus in a blood sample.
The test has the capacity to test hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, and therefore is several times faster than traditional PCR testing of viral RNA.
Antibiotics can generally be detected within 14 days of infection. No set of antibiotic tests they purchased in England in early April were found to be adequate for use.
Hong Kong has plans to have a suspicious patient stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", spit in it, send it back, and get a test result within a short time. The British NHS has announced that it is conducting an initial study of a scheme to test suspects at home, which eliminates the risk of infection if they arrive in hospital or if an ambulance is used, and does not require disinfection.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians reported on March 2 that they had the capacity to conduct an estimated 12,000 tests per day in a rotating system, with 10,700 tests conducted in the previous week.
When a doctor is asked to perform a test, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
The drive-in tests were offered in several major cities till March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey found that a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a total of 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 up to this week of 12/2020 and 12/2020, respectively. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and used a method to test 64 patients simultaneously, with all samples collected and only the next samples tested positive.
Construction was completed in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modelling has shown that if this test capacity had not been started in time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the associated cost of handling quarantine would have doubled.
The Wuhan Laboratory has been followed up with a total of 12 Huay-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Open Source Multiplex Design published by Origami Essays allows for testing for COVID-19 in 1122 patients using only 93 tests.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient reactor capacity has been a barrier to large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This led some authors to start using a sample preparation protocol that included heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to free up RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more humans for coronavirus in its population than any other country and was on track to raise testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was a combination of drive through capacity and the purchase of a population-scale wholesale throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Hu-Yan" emergency search labs in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to be so extensively operational outside of China.
Various testing activities targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's action to send kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits.
Germany's action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed the testing available in the US. In the early days of the outbreak, China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits and could not supply enough kits to meet testing recommendations from countries and Australia, demand and health experts.
On the contrary, the large number of tests available in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The large-scale testing capacity of private sector laboratories was built over several years by the South Korean administration.
On March 16, the World Health Organization ordered an increase in testing programs as the best way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The massive spread of the virus has created a huge demand for testing, resulting in hundreds of tests being surplus in private laboratories in the United States and a shortage of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC was "defective"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing. Spain purchased the test kit from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioezy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found the results to be wrong.
The company explained that the failure to collect samples or use the set properly may have led to incorrect results.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would return the incorrect test kits and replace them with separate test kits supplied by Shenzhen Biosi. The Czech Republic failed to deliver 80% of the test kits purchased from China.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that the kits be disposed of at Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the kits purchased from China by Turkey had "a large amount of errors" and that they had not "used" them.
The testing, followed by the isolation of the patients who tested positive and the tracking of those who came into contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, provided good results.
Researchers working in the city of Vovo, Italy, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred, conducted two rounds of testing on an estimated 3,400 people in the entire population of the city, with a difference of about 10 days.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and those who tested positive were isolated.
With the restriction of social life travel, the new infections were completely avoided.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on internal travel, testing and isolation, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much slower than in other developed countries and restaurants and retail establishments have not had to be forced to close by force.
Many events have been cancelled and since 28 March Singapore had begun advising citizens to stay at home, but schools reopened on 23 March at the time set after the holiday period.
Many other countries like Iceland and South Korea have managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but also through less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that have more tests than deaths have a much lower mortality rate, which is probably because these countries have only been able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 in their national laboratories should send their first five positive and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories referred by WHO for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 laboratories referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
The following table shows the impact of the country's testing policy on the score of "% of tests positive".
While the other aspects are similar, whether symptoms are seen or not, the test will be more positive than in a country that tests all citizens, which tests only hospitalized people.
Hand washing, also called hand cleaning, is the act of washing hands with the intention of removing dirt, dirt, microorganisms, or other unwanted elements.
Constant hand washing at certain "critical times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, which spread to my hands and mouth.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five important times of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's stool or changing the diaper, before breastfeeding the baby, before eating and cooking food and after or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with a soap, the World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or washing the diaper of a child who has been stung.
When you cough, cough, or sneez.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal tissue.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before medication or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and of harmful or disease-causing chemicals.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important habit for the general public.
There are many health benefits of hand washing, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And home births include reducing infant mortality.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices can lead to slight improvements in the height growth of children under five years.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by starting simple changes in behaviour such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Handwashing-promoting interventions can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third and can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing, which is performed unconsciously in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only very effective and affordable way to prevent cough and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Pneumonia with a major ARI is a leading cause of death among children under five years of age, causing an estimated 18 lakh deaths per year.
An estimated 35 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, more lives can be saved by the ingrained habit of hand washing with soap before eating and after going to the toilet than by any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also protects against the infectious disease of the fire ant, which is spread by direct physical contact.
The slightest harmful effect of hand washing is that constant hand washing can cause skin to dry up and damage the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that too much hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as hand eating, pulp loss, or hand rash, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too often washing hands is also considered a symptom of Occupational Counseling Disorder (OCD).
There are five important times a day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of disease: after going to the bathroom (small, toilet), after cleaning the baby's stool (after changing the skirt), before breastfeeding, before eating and cooking, or before/after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
In other cases, when appropriate hand washing techniques should be adopted to prevent the spread of disease, these include, before and after treatment of a cut or other wound; after crushing, coughing or nosing; after touching the animal's foreskin or after handling the animal and touching the waste.
Many countries have a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest handwashing rate was 95 percent in Saudi Arabia, about 77 percent in the United States, and 23 percent in China. Some practices are now showing an increase in handwashing with soap at critical times.
The "Emergency Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures taken to improve children's health and education.
The national programme is to disinfect the insects twice a year, as well as wash hands with soap and brush your teeth with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility of the solution and increase its solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because the fat and protein that contains organic soil elements do not dissolve instantly in water.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water.
The recycling nature of soap makes it possible to have bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria through contaminated solid soap concluded that the destruction of bacteria by foam is unlikely to cause them to migrate.
The CDC still says "Untouchable liquid soap is preferable for use".
Antibiotic soaps have been greatly promoted among health conscious people.
To date, there is no indication of the use of any recommended antiseptic or disinfectant for natural antibiotic resistance.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic components such as triclosan, which has a wide list of stress-resistant bacteria.
So, even if antibiotic stress resistants were not selected for antibiotic soaps, they might not be as effective as they were.
In addition to the faeces and skin-protective agents, refined formulations such as pH regulators may include acids (acetic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid), immunocompromising active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (cough, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are similar to consumer-grade trichlorous disinfectant soaps and are effective in removing germs from the hands.
Hot water, such as hand washing, is not enough to kill the insects.
The body temperature of the bacteria increases rapidly (37 degrees C).
However, soft water is more effective at removing natural oils from the soil and insects than cold soap water.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that soft water is not effective at reducing the load of microorganisms from the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer agent that is not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rungs, antiseptic hand rungs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most isopropyls are in the form of a gel with a thickening agent such as a carbohydrate (a polymer of acrylic acid) with alcohol or ethanol formulation, or as a moisturizing liquid such as glycerin, or as a foam to reduce the dryness of the alcohol.
The mild hydrogen peroxide increases the activity of antibiotics. At least 60 to 90 percent of the alcohol in hand sanitizers is effective antibacterial.
Alcohol-based sanitizer infects bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some germs (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and kills 99.97 percent of the hand within 30 seconds of application (a 3.5 log reduction equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99 to 99.99 percent (a 4 to 5 log reduction) of the germ within 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizer is very effective on some germs and less effective on some pathogens.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against pathogens such as norovirus (or norovac), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Use plenty of hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs to completely clean both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the middle of all fingers until liquid, foam or gel dries for about 30 seconds.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands with a hand sanitizer when you see any dirt.
The use of these agents is increasing due to their ease of use and rapid killing of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing when soap and water are not available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based sanitizer can dry the skin so that it can be softened with moisturizers and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners to this formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients reduce skin inflammation and dryness over soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergic contact dermatology, contact bile syndrome, or alcohol sensitivity or hand rubs are rarely present.
The low tendency of irritating contact to induce skin disease was to attract more than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of pathogens as soap and water because they stay on the hands.
The efficiency of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is very much dependent on the ingredients and formulations and has historically significantly overtaken alcohol and alcohol absorption.
Recently, a continuous and stored antibiotic activity has been shown in formulas using benzalkonium chloride, unlike alcohol, where performance decreases after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in the lower income group cannot afford soap and use ash and clay.
And ash and soil can be more effective than water but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, soil is also a disinfectant because when soil comes into contact with water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The WHO has recommended that as an alternative when soap is not available, ash or sand should be used.
The exact hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with mud or muddy running water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing basins can be polluted, and the water temperature appears to make little difference.
Add a lot of soap, rub your hands, put it on the back of your hands, in your fingers, under your nails, and make it foam.
Soap removes skin germs, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than they do with clean water.
Shake hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction caused by the skin is causing the skin to be eroded, and the longer the skin was eroded, the more the bacteria were eroded.
Wash your hands under running water.
Hand washing in the basin can contaminate the hands back.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth or let them dry from the air.
Wet and sluggish hands are quickly contaminated again. Thumbs, wrists, fingertips, and the underside of nails are commonly found when washing hands.
Artificial nails and partially polished needles can provide shelter for microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low cost options can be made for hand washing facilities where tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. in developing countries, if necessary, pouring water with appropriate holes from hanging jerican or hops and/or using ash. Under limited water supply conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water conservation options are available such as "tippi taps" and other low cost options.
Tipping tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with a rope to pour a little water on the hand and soap and a leg-moving liver.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
Increasing amounts of research suggest that paper towels are much healthier than electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster London and sponsored by the European Tissue Paper Industry Symposium compared the levels of cleanliness offered by towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with hot air, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194%, and the number on the stove increased by 254%.
After the jet air dryer dried up, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42 percent and the number on the stove by 15 percent.
After hand washing and drying with towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76%, and the number on the stove by 77%. Scientists conducted tests to check whether other bathroom users and the bathroom environment are likely to be contaminated as a result of each type of drying.
A jet air dryer that expels air from the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 mph) is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and contaminating the bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters long.
Using a hot air dryer, the microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. A 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand-wrapping methods.
After drying, the number of hand bacteria showed the following changes:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers out there, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels that dry.
When travelling, washing hands when soap and water are not available is an option for hand washing wipes.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (in 1846) investigated its effectiveness in preventing disease in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study showed that their use reduced the incidence of infection.
Medical hand washing takes at least 15 seconds, involving a large amount of soap and water or a gel, and washing each part of the hand thoroughly.
Hands should be tied together.
If the dirt is stuck in the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Hand washing and wiping with clean cloth is important as hand water can contain insects.
After drying, use a paper mat to close the water (and open the exit door if necessary)
This prevents the surface from contaminating the hands again.
In healthcare, hand washing is intended to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("insects") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in many medical settings, the lack of hand washing remains unacceptable, where a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching patients, causing microorganisms to infect them.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related blood flow infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper on the best practices for hand washing and hand-washing in healthcare.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the Institute can also be found on their website for public comment.
The corresponding reviews were compiled by Whitby and others.
If a demonstration of regular compliance is required, professional tools can measure and authenticate hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has five "moments" of hand washing:
If there is a connection to blood/body fluid
Before the disinfection work and
After the patient is taken care of, the soap contains antiseptic chemicals (a "drug" or "microbial" soap) that cause the hand to die in the hand washing fluid.
Such actions may be required before surgery or in areas where antibiotic resistant organisms are abundant, for surgical stimulation a hand-to-hand 'squeeze' may require a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hand, chlorhexide or iodine wash, a disinfected towel to dry the hands after washing, and a disinfected brush and other disinfectant means for cleaning the underfinger to rub.
All jewelry must be removed.
For this procedure, the hands and wrists from the corner to the corner are usually washed for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take much time (10 minutes) to rub.
When washing, water from the wrist to the corner should be avoided going back to the hands.
When the hand wash is complete, the hands are dried with disinfected cloth and the surgical gown is applied to the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands before and after taking care of a sick person or to use hand sanitizers.
For the control of hospital staphylococcal infections, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% washing, and when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35%, a very slight increase in benefit was found.
Comparing hand washing with simple soap to hand washing with antibacterial soap, the rate of food contamination with bacteria is more than three times higher. As per 30 seconds, comparing hand washing with alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, it was shown that hand washing with alcohol-based solution reduced bacterial infection by 26% over antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and clostriadium from hard sperm cells than hand-popping alcohol-based fluid. Interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings may include training staff on hand washing, making hand-popping alcohol-based fluid more available, and giving staff written and oral reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an inexpensive and necessary means to achieve good health and good nutrition.
But the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve hand washing behaviour globally.
For example, although most rural areas in Africa have affordable options for hand washing, there is a shortage of hand washing taps near every private or public toilet.
However, low hand washing can also be a result of dead habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and rewarding soap can impact policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and change long-term behaviour of the population.
To implement it effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that while a community-based approach is effective in increasing handwashing rates in LMIC, social marketing initiatives are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which, among other hygiene needs, encourages schools to take simple, affordable measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars.
The creation of a place for hand washing can be part of the efforts to promote hand washing to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behavior.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoiding daily use.
But one review suggests that encouraging hand washing with soap is significantly cheaper than using water and other sanitary interventions.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations, such as newly delivered mothers or injured hospital soldiers - the first two pioneers in hand hygiene in the mid-19th century recognized the importance of hand washing for human health: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the English founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that the odor of Miami was the cause of infection.
In 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States more actively encouraged hand washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health care-related infections.
The Swine Flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, public toilets and office buildings and airports were fitted with wall paintings showing "proper handwashing techniques" near a sink.
Washing one's hands is a phrase that refers to a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or share its complexity.
It originates in the Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase came with a wider usage in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash herself in an attempt to wash the fictional stains, while she shows her guilty conscience of the crimes she committed and forced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that when people remember or reflect on immoral activities, they wash their hands more often than others and tend to place more emphasis on hand washing devices.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other "clean" compensatory activities like volunteering.
Hand washing is said in religions for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Using water to wash hands, but not using soap, is a part of the symbolic hand washing ritual, which includes the Bahá'í, Hindu, Jewish, Tewilla and Ne'elita, Lawabos in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is mandatory after going to the toilet.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is mandatory before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards caused by COVID-19
COVID-19 Occupational Hazard Control is an application of occupational safety and health practices to control the risk of COVID-19 prevention.
The proper control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and nature of the workplace, which depends on the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues for whom basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when ill, breathing manners, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate risk of infection includes work that requires close or top-level contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 infection but who may have been infected by ongoing community infection or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets.
In addition to the basic prevention measures, the risk controls for this group include air play management using high-efficiency air filters, use of snizzards and availability of personal safety equipment if a person is facing COVID-19.
Healthcare personnel and mortuary personnel who come into contact with a known or suspected COVID-19 infected person are considered by OSHO to be at high risk of infection, in which the worker is engaged in aerosol manufacturing process or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected COVID-19 infected person, which increases the risk of exposure to the virus.
These risk controls are suitable for workers and include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal safety equipment suitable for that particular job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, need for care from others, or fear of possible infection.
In both the sense of what goods are in demand and the way to obtain them, patterns of commerce can vary (such as buying at low crowds or buying through distribution or drive-through services).
Finally, COVID-19 can interfere with the movement of goods from highly affected geographical areas.
Addresses risk levels of schemes related to various workplaces and workplaces, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors and risk factors for each worker, such as aging or obsolete medical conditions.
They also outline the contingency plans for the emergencies and the controls needed to address those risks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of developing unhealthy complications, maintaining business movements and minimizing the adverse impact on other things in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the communities where the business is located.
The framework for risk controls is a hierarchy of risk controls widely used in occupational safety and health to group in order to determine the effectiveness of risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost effective way to implement this.
Administrative controls are changes in working policies or processes that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain infections.
All PPE types should be selected based on the risk to the worker, fit according to use (e.g. respirators) and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed and properly removed, cleaned and maintained or disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-risk occupations have minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to adopt basic prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including hand washing above and fully, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, observing breathing customs with a cough and sneeze mouth covering, providing buckets for tissue paper and litter, preparing for telecommunications or various shifts if necessary, deterring workers from using other tools and equipment, and regular cleaning and disinfecting of the room.
Immediate identification and isolation of potential infected persons is an important step in ensuring the safety of workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home until at least 24 hours without taking any other fever-reducing or symptom-modifying medications, fever symptoms, or other symptoms, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member and that employees are aware of those policies.
According to OSHA, medium infection risk jobs include those jobs where people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 infection but are in the business area due to ongoing community transmission or who have recently travelled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has spread widely may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, who require close contact of the intestines of six feet (1.8 m).
These include workers who have come into contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets, including installation of high-efficiency air filters for them and higher risk groups, enhancement of air toys maintenance, physical barriers such as public plastic sneezing guards and the operation of a drive-through window bus for consumer services. These include introducing administrative controls for the risk groups and higher risk groups to encourage sick workers to stay at home, promoting the use of virtual communication tools to protect the hands of consumers, etc. These include setting up and up of personal protective equipment such as COVID-19 screens, and other tools that may be necessary to prevent and prevent COVID-19 and provide access to the environment, and providing them with a safe and safe environment, and providing them with the necessary tools and tools to prevent and prevent COVID-19 and other emergencies such as hand-on-hand contact, and providing access to personal protective clothing, and providing access to COVID-19 and other tools that may be necessary to prevent, prevent and prevent COVID-19 and to develop a safety and safety of the workplace, and to provide adequate protection of the environment, and to provide for the environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
In case of illness on board, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the person 6 feet away from others, appointing a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or telling the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
When serving an ill passenger or touching his physical fluid or potentially infected surfaces, disposable medical gloves must be worn and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing, additional personal safety equipment must be worn by the cabin crew.
For commercial vessels including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when ill and self-isolation when on board if fever or other symptoms occur and prompt notification to the onboard medical centre.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantine room. The CDC recommends that if an infected person is found in a school or child care center, whether or not it is spreading to the community, it be temporarily closed for hygiene and disinfection.
Where there is at least moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as field trips, crowd and physical education or other large ceremonies including prayer classes or dining in cafeterias, extending the distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, restricting unnecessary visitors and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
With significant infection among the local population, schools can be considered for longer periods, including social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel who are doing their usual daily tasks, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Law Enforcement Officers who need to contact other persons who have been infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the guidelines with appropriate personal protective equipment as well as emergency medical technicians.
If close contact is made during the care period, employees should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gears using household cleaning spray or wipes before reusing them and follow standard procedures for disposal, separation of clothing and washing of used PPE for a controlled period.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary personnel to be at high or very high risk of infection.
High risk activities include healthcare delivery, relief, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of infection if staff are performing aerosol-making procedures or collecting or handling samples from such patients.
Aerosol-making processes include intubation, cuff induction processes, bronchoscopes, some dental systems and examination or invasive sampling.
High-risk cemetery work includes personnel involved in preparing the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 patients at death; if they are decomposed, they are at very high risk of infection.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary structures.
Sampling with 3 Biosafety Level Processes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients should be isolated in separate waiting rooms if suspected of COVID-19. Like other PPE, OSHA recommends that staff working within 6 feet of suspected patients who are known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and perform aerosol-making processes should be allowed to use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory masks or better should be used in reference to comprehensive, written respiratory protection systems, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and make employees more comfortable. WHO does not recommend protecting the whole body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other secretions of the body.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be worn by staff who inspect the entrance.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, eyeglasses or face covers, gauntlets and gloves for personnel collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment without any aerosol-making procedures.
If aerosol-making process has been carried out, N95 or FFP2 respiratory protectors should be used instead of surgical masks.
Due to the inadequacy of global supply of PPE, telemedicine should use physical barriers such as clean windows, allowing access to the premises of COVID-19 patients directly to healthcare providers using only PPE required for specific tasks, reducing the need for PPE use for them, using the same respiratory mask without sidestepping when serving multiple patients with the same diagnosis, maintaining monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and providing services without encouraging the use of masks to those without symptoms.

Subject: [COVID-19] Reducing burden and preparing for the future
Date and time of delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: no rights reserved
We find ourselves in a significant situation this month.
The global pandemic of COVID-19 is one of the things that explains the interconnectedness of global humanity and our responsibilities to each other.
We don't have any prior evidence of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global compassion, cooperation and team building at the heart of our organization.
A remarkable proof of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with such amazing people is the kindness and care that all of our colleagues show through email, phone and chat.
I can't be more grateful and proud to call you my colleague.
Last week, someone praised me for my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to read Wikipedia right now and how powerful it is to have this important tool online and accessible to everyone.
It is your work that has made it possible to keep this site up to date or pay our colleagues or keep your group safe.
The world needs more information than the world needs now.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will make us start to make some significant changes in the way we work together from next week.
Changes in your work and work schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what would be the right response to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We are keen to relieve stress and support our mission in the long run.
You want to dial again, it doesn't matter.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used for this campaign.
But at the moment, the world is unpredictable and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
I don't need to say this, but we're saying this.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team to adjust the calendar and schedule so that important parts of the work can be done safely.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Brian at T&C Ops so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by management).
Full pay will be paid to the hourly workers.
We have already said and reaffirm our commitment to respect our commitment to our contractors and our working-hour staff.
Each will be paid according to his normal working hours.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress about the world around them.
Especially in such a period, what we do can have incredible benefits.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your managers so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (among others) do important work which may require additional assistance.
We will start the process with all departments to assess the current targets and focus on helping the essential elements for our mission.
There is a lot of work to do for all of us, we will focus only on the most important projects.
If you work slowly now, you won't lose later.
Once this global trend has gone, we have no plans to "work twice as long to finish the job".
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to keep up with the seemingly unrealistic work schedule.
We accept that the situation has changed and when appropriate, we will work to set new goals and schedules.
What happens to the APP?
As we adjust our new realistic and daily work hours expectations, our aim is to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
The aim is to propose to extend our 2019-2020 Plan so that employees can have more time to prioritize important tasks, self-care and the care of their opponents, who need to work in the next few weeks or who wish to work for a shorter period.
This extension of the deadline will significantly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and as we confirm this, we will update our representatives and teams on further action.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this.
Office attendance, infection and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our SF sector employees is likely to be infected with COVID-19 virus.
However, with extreme caution, we have appointed a disinfecting team to disinfect all areas in our San Francisco offices.
They use high-quality disinfectants used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the shores of the leakage pipes that come into our floors.
The building uses its own precautions to help its tenants be safe.
We are pleased that when we decide to return, these offices will be fully operational.
Our DC office is located in WeWork areas where they have shared their COVID-19 response with us and all other DC-area employees.
Last week, our DC office moved to a fully remote set-up following guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC area know, we're discussing rents for a seat in Brooklyn.
We're talking about this, but we can be late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Longtime remote workers know this is just an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Explain clearly the schedule of the meeting and send them the material in advance.
Make this video a default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
Ask someone to lead each meeting to make it easier, who will monitor the chat for the questions asked and check the list of speakers and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a convenient headset, email the tech assistant.
Use your 'welfare payback' for the destruction.
Join the #RemoteChannels on SLAKE to talk to your colleagues about the task at hand.
The HR team is looking at webinar based ergonomics to help increase the work that is being delivered across the organization.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to suspend Wikimedia-funded mass events like "EditatHons" until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we have learned that our request for suspension and other restrictions will make it impossible to meet their agreed grant schedule, and also that no one will be punished for delaying this and changing that target.
Next week we will follow up on additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
A common feeling of the entire global community is that this disintegration is both sad but also pleasant, and that it is also a clear and focused ability to target our own communities, Wikipedia and others.
As we move forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to allow the community to monitor this impact and to provide space for the community to track our interactions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on 14th: 00 UTC/ 07:00 PT next Thursday.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all in this together and we are here to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we will continue to get information through this email and other important information about COVID-19 on the Office-Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, a ceremony, a major workflow, or any challenges you are considering, or need help with anything else, do not hesitate to notify and work with CRT.
We are here to help and cooperate and to establish contact if necessary.
If you have any confidential or sensitive material, please email Brian Judan, Director of Human Resources Global.
None of these changes should be seen as a compromise or a commitment.
Instead, they have to formally acknowledge that right now we need to take on our work and responsibilities in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to cooperate with each other, so that we can continue to work, meet their needs and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, these planned tasks will help us.
For now, it is time to cooperate and make room for important projects that will be addressed in the coming week and possible month.
To make this happen, we need all of you, so you need to take care of yourself and your family so that you can do your best when you need to.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Joel L., Lynette L. Ryan M., and Tony S.) and the remaining members of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Jenin U., Lisa S., Robin A. Ryan M., and Toby N.).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cellular membrane) in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing the levels of Ang1 to 7 it counteracts the action of the ACE2 related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and thus is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallol-enzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucous-cutaneous protein that is activated by its enzyme action on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra cellular domain of ACE2 is broken down by a second transmembrane called the shades, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: the membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, the enterocytes in the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, and the smooth muscle fibers of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as an ACE resistant.
ACE angiotensin I allows the hormone to be released into vascoconstricting angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 breaks down the carboxylic-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
[des-Arg9]-ACE2 can break down many other peptides including bradyquinine, epylene, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the screen transport of neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface by the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and the transfer of both virus and enzyme is in the endosomes located within the cells.
The access process also requires the priming of the host serine protein TMPRSS2, which is being prevented as a potential treatment in current investigations. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, those who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure, had lower risk when treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors were less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also relevant in terms of reducing the mortality associated with pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipo policaride-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours, and it takes 30 minutes to start its effects, and its effects last for 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or intolerance to high levels of imbalance angiotensin. In clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, infused rhACE2 has been evaluated.
b-COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help communicate in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person who is in contact with an infected person ("contact").
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
A number of frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing apps.
In particular, privacy concerns have been raised in systems that track the geographic location of app users.
The low-key option is to use the Blue Tooth signal to log the user's other cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such Blue Tooth-based apps will integrate functionality to support directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has jointly with Alipe, made available an app to allow citizens to check if they have come into contact with people infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, the app is called Trace Together.
The app was developed by a local IT community and is available as open source and will be delivered to the government.North Macedonia launched a Blue Tooth-based app called "Stop Corona" to reach out to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store as of April 14, 2020.
The Government said on 12 April 2020 that the app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Togahedron and Blue Tooth Protocol.Russia intends to introduce a Geofencing App designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow will not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the possibility of false positives and the low probability of effectiveness of apps if the use of the app is limited to a very small percentage of the population.
Expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting it to only "authorized" or otherwise reputable entities.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
The campaigners expressed serious concern about the impact of mass surveillance using the Corona Virus Privacy Apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to combat the Corona Virus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement demanding restrictions on such surveillance.
The agencies announced eight conditions for government projects:
The surveillance must be "legal, necessary and standardised";
Extension of monitoring and surveillance shall include Sunset clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the causes of COVID-19;
Information security and anonymity must be secured and demonstrated to be protected on a comprehensive basis;
Digital surveillance should avoid severe discrimination and neglect;
Sharing of information with third parties should be defined by law;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
Meaningful involvement of all "related stakeholders", including public health experts and neglected groups, is required.
Once the need for tracking system is over, the proposed Google/Apple scheme aims to address the problem of permanently removing tracking from their device operating system.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps to avoid tracking.
Network based tracking was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication.
In South Korea, a system was used to introduce contact tracing that was not based on app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system combined various tracking information including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined potential infected individuals to generate notifications via text message.
In addition to using this information to warn against potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, something that was allowed due to far-reaching changes in the Information Privacy Act after the MERS outbreak in that country.
The information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries including Germany considered both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released as of 6 April 2020.
- Protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with research material dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly measures, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and no single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy - proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking (PACT) and others.
These protocols never release identifiable personal data from the device and all matching is on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform for using privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or path crosspoints to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic". Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a privacy technology development company created by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows the user to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data, using secure data hardware technology.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups that originally came together around a common approach and mostly overlapping protocols and aimed to reduce fragmentation, retaliate and enable the effectiveness of alerting apps, which is a key aspect of the wider adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on the combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy cryptography, which they claim will maintain privacy.
He also published the features of the underlying technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be broken down into three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create government privacy - Protect Corona Virus Tracing Apps.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS, Android, Google and Apple is intended to address continuous monitoring issues by first delivering the system through operating system updates and then dealing with it again after the threat is avoided.
Drug repositization (also known as drug re-purposing, re-profiling, reskiing, or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug originally approved for one disease or disease for the treatment of another disease.
This is the same kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and quality treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma transmission for vaccines and rehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drug-enabled proteins, each with multiple binding sites.
Analysis of such binding sites provides the right leverage to develop a beneficial antiviral against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteins such as papene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerization, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A.A. and others studied various candidate compounds and then analyzed their similarity in form with similarly approved medicines to recommend it in the clinical study framework by developing an anti-COVID-2 anti-genetic drug in their preclinical studies.
Chlorine is an anti-inflammatory drug used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial will include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be conducted from March 24, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorophyll phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the United States.
It is authorized under the EU to conduct only experimental treatment for patients who have not been admitted to hospital but cannot receive treatment under clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been certified.
The doctors have said that this medicine is used when "there is no other option left".
A small study was conducted by the Turkish Research Team in Istanbul, which used chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
There is a large study at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure is being tested by NYU Langon Medical School.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipirvir is "fully effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in 4 days, while the incidence of the disease in 45 patients was 11 days.
In a study in Wuhan, 240 patients with pneumonia received half of the patients fever and half of the patients received umiphenoir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminded people that the current supply of medicines is insufficient and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine from Japan for storage, and with the help of the army, distribute it to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe held formal talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in patients with severe disease because the virus has already multiplied there.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/retonavir (Calletra), which combined lopinavir and retonavir against viruses, found "no benefit".
The drugs were designed to prevent the reproduction of HIV by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to find compounds that bind to the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by improving these drugs.
The WHO included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat infections with Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir showed anti-phyllo-, pneumocy-, paramycoso-, and coronaviral anti-inflammatory activity.
One problem with antiviral treatments is the resistance developed by mutations that lead to more serious illnesses and infections.
Some previous pre-test studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high gene resistance to immunity. Some clinical trials are underway, with two trials being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and one for people with severe illness.
Three clinical trials are underway to administer vitamin C intravenously to patients with severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalized; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

b'A COVID 19 vaccine is a fictional vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no clinical trials of any vaccine have been completed, many efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said in late February 2020 that the SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral vaccine is not expected to be available for 18 months.
In April, a Phase I safety study was underway on five vaccine candidates.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The outbreak in 2020 in the world led to massive investment and research in developing vaccines.
Many organizations are using the genome published to develop a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
As announced in April, CEPI initiatives are essential for developing vaccine, including speed, production capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists learned that research and development is underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives of the Phase I Security Study are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Progression I) Developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Progression I developer and vaccine candidate:Cannasin Biology, Adenovirus Type 5 vector)
According to the information received by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in pre-development phase, with 78 projects confirmed to be underway, while another 37 have been announced with very little information being made public.
Its safety and immunity are primarily tested in Phase I-II trials, and it is usually performed at random, placebo controlled and multiple sites to determine even more accurate, qualitative doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease is checked and followed up for side effects after adequate doses.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet been evaluated in humans.
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is exploring a potential molecular clamp vaccine that will induce an immune response by genetically modifying viral proteins.

CEPI has investment partners to develop COVID-19 vaccines including Moderna, Quarvac, Inovavo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
Russian health officials announced on March 20, 2020 that scientists have started testing on animals for six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers from Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
The Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 projects of medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including various vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the MediCago and Saskatchewan initiatives, at the end of March.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million to develop a vaccine specifically for COVID-19, which included plans to establish a national "Vaccine Bank" that could be used in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that Pitkovak is testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, informing that "an effective antigen-specific immunity response [in mice] of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine administered by the MNA was tested with doses starting to be received 2 weeks after vaccination".
The University of Waterloo School of Medicine in Canada announced on 16 April 2020 that it plans to develop a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a vaccination fountain.
DNA will be produced using a bacterial predator that will replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which will stimulate the immune system to form antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, along with Amazon, Microsoft and Google, were used jointly by the United Nations government, industry and three universities to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have unusual effects, which can be called unexpected effects.
This means that besides preventing the disease, it can also provide other benefits.
Furthermore, 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomized trial in Australia.
The vaccine being developed is likely to be neither safe nor effective.
Previous research to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and primates other than humans suggests the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity level 3 control measures and standardized safety procedures to manage live viruses.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no cure for SARS or vaccine available to humans that is both safe and effective.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.
As MERS became more prevalent, ongoing research on SARS was believed to provide a useful model for finding vaccines and medicines for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, Phase I clinical trials of one DNA-based MERS vaccine in humans had been completed, and work was underway on three other vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-Gamvac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
The post on social media has sparked discussion about the car park, where the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
Patents presented as evidence from various posts on social media refer to patents that exist for gene sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Fever, cough, and difficulty breathing are common symptoms.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain.
The duration of the onset of symptoms from the blockage is usually five days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, while some patients have increased disease, resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, out of which 153,000 cases have died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The transmission of the virus among people is mainly through direct contact, often through coughing, sneezing, or vomiting.
When they breathe out, these pimples are expelled and fall to the ground or surface, not carrying infection for long distances.
It can also be transmitted by touching the eyes, nose and mouth by touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus lives on any surface for 72 hours.
It is highly contagious for the first three days after symptoms begin, but can spread before and after symptoms. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasagrassi fluid is the standard method of diagnosis.
Those who are suspected of being infected and those who provide services to them are advised to wear masks.
The general public has been given different advice on wearing a mask, some officials are against wearing a mask, others are advising it and others are saying it is necessary.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
Most of the countries in all six WHO regions have reported local infections.
Patients with viral disorders sometimes show no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Accidental symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or stress, feeling confused, difficulty walking and blue appearance of face and lips; if these symptoms are detected, immediate hospital treatment is recommended.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as nausea, runny nose, or a sore throat.
Some patients had fewer or more food allergy symptoms such as dizziness, dizziness and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially experienced chest tightness and heartbeat.
Some patients were reported to have advanced disease, including pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some cases it can be two to 14 days.
The 97.5% of patients who developed symptoms appeared within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected patients developed symptoms.
The role of carriers without these symptoms in infection is not yet clear; however, from the initial doses, they are said to be involved in the spread of the disease.
The number of patients who have been infected with no symptoms has not been reported and is being studied, while 20% of patients confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) have reported no symptoms until the patient is hospitalized.
The National Health Commission of China began to include patients without symptoms in daily cases from April 1; of the 166 infected patients reported that day, 130 (78%) patients had no symptoms at the time of examination.
Both the spine and the spleen carry a large viral load.
Speaking out loud is more likely to get rid of lice than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without mouthing can cause lice to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not produced from air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted that it may be transmitted by aerosol and samples taken from gas collectors outside people's homes have found positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as injecting and resuming the heart and blood vessels, can cause a flow of fluid through the airway and thus spread through the air.
When the virus is thought to be transmitted through the esophagus, the risk is considered low, and people with symptoms of the virus are the most likely to get it; besides.
Although it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it can be transmitted from one person to two to three people.
The virus was found to stay on paper paper for a day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99 percent copper surfaces for four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and varies accordingly.
Soap and detergents can be effective if used properly; soap products lower the thick protective layer of the virus, deactivate it, and isolate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzaconum chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a type of surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In one study in Hong Kong, red blood cells were sampled within two days of being admitted to hospital.
Five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest number of pathogens, and the sixth patient had the highest number of pathogens on the second day of testing.
Several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel hyperventilation virus with symptoms. It was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease Patients' Centre.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap that forms its protective bubble. The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the SARS-CoV virus.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs, as the virus reaches the stem cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in other types of lung venous cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the stem cells.
In Wuhan, China, 12 percent of patients admitted to hospitals have also experienced severe heart attacks, and are more frequent in serious illness.
While severe heart disease symptoms are widespread due to inflammatory response of the body and deterioration of immunity during disease spread, severe heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptor factors in the heart.
ACE2 is a rich fatty acid found in the heart and is involved in heart function.
Examples of freezing (31%) and venous blood freezing (25%) have been found in large numbers in severe COVID-19 patients, possibly associated with an improper diagnosis. Blood samples of patients who died due to COVID-19 have been found to have had their lungs impaired (difuse alveolar damage) and white blood cells have also been found to have inflamed in the lungs.
Although SARS-COVID-2 tends to be associated with respiratory metastatic cells for ACE2, severe patients with COVID-19 show symptoms of hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-stranded T-cells were found to be associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-stranded monocytes in COVID-19 patients and acute lung diagnosis.
The autopsy also showed the penetration of white blood cells.
The World Health Organization has published several guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is an approved test method.
Respiratory samples from the throat are usually tested; however, samples of respiratory discharge or sputum may also be used.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results are immediately low.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequences, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to identify infections of the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose current infections and also tell if a person has been infected before) were being developed, but they were not widely used.
The experience of the tests in China shows that their accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The first point of care test was approved by the FDA in the United States on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease.
Bilateral multilobber ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution was common in early infections.
The disease may increase with subplural dominance, abnormal peving (a thickening of the lobular septal with a variable alveolar filling) and concentration.
There is little information available about the physiology and micro-injury of COVID-19.
The following are some important facts about the diagnosis found in autopsies:
What the eye can see: inflammation of the lungs, heartburn, strengthening of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of pneumonia that are known to be severe:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, overgrowth of lung cells, unrelated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation with intrusion of white cells, and the formation of versatile large cells.
Acute pneumonia: pulmonary failure and uncontrolled pulmonary discharge
Diffuse alveolar damage is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute oxygen deficiency.
Treatment for pneumonia: uncontrolled accumulation of discharge in the lung cavities and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: accumulation of internal discharge into the arteries (disseminated intravascular coagulation); leukocytophthroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, keeping the airway clean, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing.
The CDC recommends that you wear a towel in front of your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.
Hand washing is recommended after any kind of cough or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended that people wear face coverings when walking in public places to limit infection from people who do not have symptoms. Social distancing is intended to reduce contact with large crowds of infected people.
In terms of distance, people are told to keep at least 6 feet apart from each other.
The vaccine is not expected to be available until 2021, so the key part of COVID-19 management right now is to control the disease, also known as 'Flatning the Curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when going to the toilet or when hands appear to be dirty, before eating and after touching their nose and after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends that hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol be used, but only when soap and water are not available. The World Health Organization has two formulas for local production in areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available.
In these formulae, the antibiotic activity is produced by ethanol or isopropenol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microbes in alcohol; it is not an active agent for hand sterilization.
Glycerol has been added as a moisture-preserving ingredient.
Patients are managed through supportive care, which includes oxygen delivery, fluid treatment and other support to the vital organs affected.
CDC suggests that anyone who suspects we are carriers of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
Oxygen therapy has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being seen.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments can be used in those who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Critical pathologists and pulmonologists in the United States have combined treatment recommendations from various agencies under a single open source, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatments have been determined for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals suggest starting with paracetamol instead of ibuprofen because of symptoms.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of spread of the virus, especially when using medical facilities when processes that produce physical fluids in the air, such as body tubing or hand ventilation, are being used.
For healthcare personnel caring for COVID-19 patients, CDC recommends that the patient be kept in Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to taking general precautions, contact care and airborne transmission precautions at such times.
Preventive devices recommended for preparation: PPE Gaun, respirator or face mask, eye safety and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred over face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial applications but, FDA has also approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as air dust, but, in other uses, their effectiveness against a specific biological medium cannot be guaranteed.
When masks are not available, face masks or homemade masks can be used as a last resort as recommended by the CDC.
Most COVID-19 patients are not as serious as they need medical ventilation or some other alternative, but a small percentage of them are.
The type of medical respiratory facilities available to patients due to respiratory obstructions due to COVID-19 is being continuously studied for people in hospitals.
It is not yet known whether either of these benefits are equally beneficial for patients with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, because they limit the spread of airborne pathogens over the respiratory tract rather than the intravenous ventilation. The rate of severe disease is very high among older people.
Many developed countries also do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, so a sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases could limit the capacity of the health system to handle the issue of hospitalization.
According to a study in China, 5 percent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 percent of the patients needed technical support for external ventilation, and 1.4 percent of the patients died.
About 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in China were eventually admitted to the ICU.
As patients with COVID-19 develop severe respiratory problems (ARDS), technical ventilation becomes more complicated and oxygen delivery becomes more difficult.
Compression control ventilators and high PEEPs are required to provide more oxygen while reducing the risk of pneumothorax and lung injury caused by the ventilator.
The old ventilators may not have high capacity PEEP available.
Research on potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing trials since then.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 for new drugs to develop, many drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or are undergoing further testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on seriously ill patients.
Volunteers are encouraged by the World Health Organization to participate in trials to study the efficacy and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has provisionally approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can show 'close contact' from the observed data and can identify the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are identified, the app suggests self-isolation, and not only that, it informs local health authorities about it. Big data analytics on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are all being used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and those who come into contact with them.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security departments to check the mobile phone data of people who are likely to be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom submitted a collection of location data to the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to be used to prevent the spread of the virus and to conduct research.
Russia has installed facial recognition technology to track people who break the isolation.
Italy's Regional Health Commissioner, Julio Gallari, said he was getting information via mobile phones.
The German government hosted the 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42000 participants.
President of Estonia, Kirsti Karlulid, has also called for a global challenge to take concrete measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People can be disturbed by isolation, travel restrictions, adverse treatment effects, or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Growing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and economic decline are the root causes of the threat to people's mental health and well-being".
These can have very few or no symptoms, which is similar to other respiratory illnesses such as colds and colds.
Mild cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on information from other similar viruses like SARS, MERS, we can say that pregnant women who are seriously infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
Of the people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19, 6% have been found to have blood clots, increased prothrombin time, and renal dysfunction in 4% of these groups.
Nearly 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have high liver enzyme.
The report also said that the period between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 days were for hospitalization.
However, the average time for patients admitted to the intensive care unit was seven days.
Initial case studies found that the median time to death from the onset of symptoms to the onset of the disease was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women was 1.7%.
A post-mortem pulmonary sample histopathological test showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyaroxide in both lungs.
Viral cytophatic changes were seen in the pneumosites.
The pulmonary imaging was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
High levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were found in 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to a March report, 89% of hospitalized people in the United States had some complaints. Availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of the region also affect the dying.
The regional gaps change the estimates of mortality in this situation, but also due to the difficulties of the method.
Reducing the number of mild cases can increase the mortality estimate.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of past contact cases may mean that the current estimated mortality rate is low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and are approximately 2.4 times more likely to require hyperactive care or die.
Officials at a Hong Kong hospital found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who had recovered from the disease, and a lung scan showed organ damage.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome when you recover.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from this disease.
Based on the treatment of other coronaviruses, it is possible to see immunity, but cases in which the coronavirus test positive after recovering from COVID-19 have been reported in the next few days.
It is believed that such cases may have a prolonged infection rather than recurrent infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and originated from an animal and is spread by infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that the earliest date for manifesting symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The official release by WHO has listed 8 December 2019 as the starting date for the onset of symptoms.
Various measures are commonly used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and from time to time and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, duration of the outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO has provided the emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease code U07.1 to COVID-19 deaths that have not been clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
Other measures include the hair mortality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These figures are not time-bound and they are based on specific populations of people infected by case variation.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, so the presence of antibodies may be a good indication of how many people are infected.
In Italy, at the heart of the outbreak, a small village called Castiglione d'Adda has so far killed 4600,80 (1.7%) people.
The spread of the disease in Gangelet was due to the Carnival Festival and the spread among young people, which resulted in a relatively low mortality rate and may not be able to formally classify all COVID-19 deaths in this way.
Besides, the German health system is not as burdened.
In the Netherlands, perhaps about 3% of people may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 people (0.004%) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The outcome and mortality rate of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that male mortality rates are higher.
Men in their 50s are at greatest risk, and the lowest mortality gap between women and men is in the 90s.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women was 1.7%.
The exact cause of these sex differences is unknown, but it could be genetic and behavioral.
Gender-based immunity gaps, low prevalence of smoking among women, and co-occurring conditions such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age than women can all be factors in higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government did not have access to gender information among COVID-19 infected people.
Research has found that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially women nurses, are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tendros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI for Virus, D for Disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease was reported: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (such as China), animal species, or group of people, which followed the international naming recommendations, and was intended to avoid anyone being tainted. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus".
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for these viruses and diseases, following the 2015 guidelines against using sites in the name of these diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard incomplete chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials as needle swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, in an Italian clinic when a ventilator valve was urgently needed and the supplier was unable to supply it in time, a local startup company reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves overnight.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the source, extent, treatment and other details of the disease were cut, misrepresented and distorted and quickly spread online.
Humanity has discovered that it is capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
This study was successful in finding evidence that the virus was replicated in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is underway by the Government.
In March, WHO launched a Solidarity Trial to assess the therapeutic impact of four of the most effective existing antiviral compounds.
While there is no vaccine available, various agencies are actively preparing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurotransmitters to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccination strategies have been developed.
First, the goal of the researchers is to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether it is an inactive or dead virus, is intended to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate immune response of the human body.
Another strategy is sub-unit vaccines, which aim to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to a specific sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus to differentiate the ACE2 enzyme neurotransmitter.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology for creating vaccines).
The trials for safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies are required. A clinical trial of one vaccine with four volunteers was launched in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains a safe genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent preservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were evaluated from previously approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese inventions involve multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials on Phase III on Remediciver being conducted in several countries, according to a report submitted at the end of April.
According to the April 2020 report, there is a dynamic review of medical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral medicines have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedicivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Rythonvir and Interferon Beta, including Lopinavir/Rythonvir.
According to a March 2020 report, there is a provisional evidence of exposure to Remedicivir.
The patients treated with Remediciver showed improvement in their medical condition.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, this research requires a collective review.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that its double dose is very dangerous and can even lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese Seventh Edition Guidelines also include interferon, raibavirin or umfenowahir for use against Corona-19.
The primary data suggests that high doses of Raibavirin are required in the test to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further testing after the low-concentration prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spike protein priming through transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE-2 mechanism.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have been severely challenged which prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and found no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytoquin storm can be complicated in the next stages of severe COVID-19.
Evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytoquin-storm properties is given by the National Health Commission of China, which has included tocilizumab in its treatment guidelines after a small study.
With positive results in people with serious illnesses, non-random Phase 2 trials are underway nationally in Italy.
If the serum ferritin is combined with a blood test to identify cytokine storm, it means resisting the development of what has been thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved Interleukin-6 Neuronal Antivirus, based on a previous study for the treatment of multi-dimensional steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, called CAR T cell therapy.
There is no random, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Research is underway as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination of the purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 among those who need it.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it did not have any specific results.
The expected mechanism of action is viral neutralization, which can be used to treat passive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of covalent serum, which includes fluid proteins from the blood of patients who have recovered and which includes antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Dr. Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
