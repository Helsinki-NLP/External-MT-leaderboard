Two influential women share their secrets to success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
New York real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran was able to turn a $1,000 loan into a $5 billion real estate company before applying her expertise to the screen as a panelist on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.
Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female boxer ever as a four-time undefeated champion before her resume included roles as a television host, author and speaker.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), T.J. Maxx recruited both women to help talk to the room-packed promising entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and found that 80 percent of them feel that society has stereotypically set certain roles and expectations for them.
So they came up with The Maxx You Project to help women break down these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know so much about it, and they may be at the top of their game by now, but the journey there hasn't been smooth for either of them.
Corcoran had mostly gotten D's in high school and college and had worked 20 jobs by the time he was 23.
Ali was entering one of the most man-centric fields in the world and facing the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was an icon of the world.
These two, to put it mildly, are packing through the hard-won knowledge.
So we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failure, coping with success, and trusting your gut in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired every day by my personal goals.
I've developed a habit of writing down things I want to accomplish.
And I'm looking at this list.
I feel responsible.
Of course, I'm inspired by my kids.
My ambitions are inspiring.
I want to be a winner in everything I do in life.
I realize that achieving my goals will require hard work, but I am willing to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, the key to my confidence is a little bit of preparation, but I don't shy away from that.
Actually, I'm inspired by a genuine curiosity.
What happens if I do this?
What's not to be if I don't?
It's this curiosity that makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings.
Some days, when I don't feel like this, I just pretend to.
Then I'll be ashamed to believe in myself and get inspired again.
Tell me about some obstacles in your career that made you better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my business partner's boyfriend left me and married my secretary.
I quit the business a year later, but that year of my life - being the fifth wheel - was terrible because I didn't have enough confidence to leave.
I felt overwhelmed, lacking all inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest part about believing in it is when you're having setbacks.
Getting back on my feet and starting the business from scratch - this time without a partner - was an extremely difficult year.
Laila Ali: I would say the most difficult time in my career was when I was in boxing, I was at the peak of my career, and I decided to file for divorce.
I not only divorced my husband, but I also divorced my manager and the man who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do it without her.
So I started to worry about the future of my career, and I had to take the time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all this experience in the boxing ring.
I have no doubt that you can do it".
So I formed a new team around myself and continued my career.
In fact, all you had to do was get in the right frame of mind, because everything else was just a spur of the moment.
I did what I had to do, I had to face my fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and my manager and get on with my career.
When did you feel that you had really succeeded?
Laila Ali: I felt like I had achieved something when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be unbeatable.
I was able to achieve that goal and won the championship not once but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment I felt I had achieved was in my 11th year.
I was finally making a profit.
I had made about $42,000 in profit, which I did not expect.
I went out and bought my mom and dad a new car, and they had never had a new car before, and I had them take the cars to Florida, where they retired.
I felt like the queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I made a lot more money from it in the years that followed, but nothing has ever been able to offer a feeling like the opportunity to give something back to my parents and surprise them.
How did you manage to stay motivated to keep working during that 11-year period?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profits because that wasn't my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could go.
I set out on my first day to become a real estate agent in New York.
And I saw myself in the spirit world as the Pope, everyone kissing my ring and adoring me.
I had this little thought in my head.
So when I was trying to do this every day, every hour, I wasn't really thinking about making money.
I finally made money by accident.
But all the money that came in, I put right back into the business.
I don't even think I've ever had a day of discouragement where I thought, "Oh, my God, we're not making any money".
I was just convinced something was gonna work.
The worst that could have happened was losing the company and going back to being a waitress.
I was making good tips and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
So I don't think that the main pursuit of many successful people is money.
They have other motives that motivate them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for anyone who has such big dreams but is held back by financial constraints?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I started a company.
And so I found myself five different partners who weren't even real estate professionals, but in different neighborhoods all over the city who knew their streets through and through.
I walked up to them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner".
The lesson here is that when you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a talent, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money off of it.
There are two parts to this: gift and money.
But when they're not together, nothing big happens.
After all, I - and my partners - have done very well over the years with these great investors, which I would never have had if I hadn't had the courage to find aggressive people who like to step up.
There's always money to be made if you believe you have a gift and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
Let's talk about the morning routine. What are the two or three things you do every morning that will help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have many moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed, being a mother, a businesswoman, a wife -- all the roles that we play as women.
I got to a point in my life where I really had to get back into my morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Gratitude for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I often write down my goals for the next day, and when I wake up, I review the list.
I'm going to meditate.
Sometimes I write in my diary.
I always have a cup of coffee.
And I always work out first thing in the morning, because if I don't, I won't.
For me, it's all about priorities.
These are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then my exercise and putting my health first.
It makes everything else seem easy.
I feel like I can conquer any challenge that comes my way during the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm going to prioritize things.
I'm working through my list of tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'm gonna put the most important thing in place.
What are the real priorities?
I try to accept that I'm achieving the most important things.
What are you doing to get in the right frame of mind for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I imagine myself going down.
It's as strange as it is.
I think, my God, I'm failing.
I'm scared of myself, and it makes me work harder.
I imagine anyone who competes with me -- I'm naturally very combative because I'm one of ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I can be very competitive.
And I always come in too thoroughly prepared.
I'm just getting more confidence from the extra preparation.
Laila Ali: It's amazing how conflicted we are about this.
We're two successful people, and it shows how different things work for different people.
I like to think I'm successful.
I like to think about success in the end.
I'm imagining it in my mind, I'm seeing it actually happening.
I see myself entering the ring, fighting, winning my belt and returning to the locker room, celebrating with a piece of cake, like I always have.
The same goes for dating.
But I always prepare myself thoroughly, and that confidence comes from preparation, because there's this fear in my head that I'm not going to do well or I'm not going to say the right things or I'm not going to have the information I need.
That's where the game prep comes in for me.
But I always enter by visualizing the end result.
You've both had very successful careers.
How are you passing it on?
Laila Ali: I'm really excited to be a part of T.J. Maxx's Maxx You Project, because I feel like it's an opportunity to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in all of us.
It's really about attitude and having the tools, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things that you're trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I do very well is inspire people.
So I was very excited when I was asked to work with the Maxx You Project.
I'm trying to kindle the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see in the faces of all these people here, and give them some practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start out pursuing their dreams, but they tend to get lost at some point along the way.
So we try to help them focus on the goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even something as simple as an elevator call, everything you need to start a business.
What advice would you give to women who want to succeed in male-dominated fields?
Laila Ali: I work in one of the most male-centric fields, which is boxing.
Following in the footsteps of my father, who was a global icon and the greatest of all time, was pretty daunting.
For me, the point was really to find that gift, the courage, the strength within yourself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could get into the ring and be successful.
At that moment, no one but me was involved and there were no restrictions on my path except those I had set in my own head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey from finding inspiration and having my attitude of "New York real estate queen" to crossing the finish line is an enormous one.
And in this intermediate stage, which is every day of your career, it takes a lot of talent.
You don't have to be a realtor to need these gifts.
I'm sure that in the case of Laila, you had to decide who the right people were, the right managers, when to start, when to stop, how much money you had, what you could put in, what you couldn't, how hard you were willing to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I try to make these efforts a little more supportive so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it.
Let me try it.
Here are my three priorities".
When they leave with three main priorities to really get things done, I go home at night and go to bed smiling.
What's in your nightgown right now?
Laila Ali: Too much shit.
The magazines, the books, the little prayer angel, my diary.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightstand has a little green flip-up alarm clock, because I've been trying to break the habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.
That's why I got this.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And it's still standing there.
And my phone is still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading?
Barbara Corcoran: Eighth or ninth time "How to Win Friends and Influence People".
It keeps me on track.
I think it's still the best book ever written on the subject, no matter what your dreams are.
And it can be approached today in exactly the same way as it was in the past.
I like to read it over from time to time.
It'll help me get back on track.
Laila Ali: I'm in nutrition school, so I'm reading the book The Nutritionally Healthy Diet.
It's about eating grains and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice for coping with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists, you know?
You can find them in all kinds of shapes.
You need to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the whiners.
They're draining your energy.
I treat whiners like thieves.
They come in at night, they grab your wallet and they leave.
Pessimists destroy a team in any team situation faster than you can blink an eye, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad, too.
They're dragging good people down with them.
I'm perfectly capable of avoiding all negative people within a 30-mile radius of me because my goal is to be positive and take everything I can take from life and give back everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend even a minute with people like that?
Laila Ali: It has to be consistent.
Many times we start off convinced that we are on this path.
We do this, we do that, we do that.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you're passionate about something, if you believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: It takes a lot of work to keep things consistent.
You know what it takes?
Finishing things.
You start something, you finish it.
Many are good beginners, but not very good graduates.
The largest number of non-citizens in Latvia is in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
There are 125 344 non-citizens in Riga, 14 266 in Daugavpils and 11 909 in Liepājas.
Outside the major cities, the largest numbers of stateless people live in Jekappils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 persons living in Latvia were not Latvian citizens.
In 2007, there were 392 816 stateless persons in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently pointed out on Facebook: "The quote is a bad reason".
So I will not look back and try not to recall what has been done in history to regenerate human nature and what results have been achieved.
I am not making a judgment as to whether these experiments can be considered successful or unsuccessful.
I also avoid excessive references to sources, though I do lean on the thought of my most important teacher, Thomas Paul: All my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if only I remember where exactly.
The most striking thrust of Estonia's current work is the re-education of the citizen of the Republic of Estonia - into a perfect human being.
We don't raise him like a child, in the hope that he'll become a human.
We raise him to be what the ruling class imagines him to be - what a person must be to live in Estonia and speak publicly.
The censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed somewhat a year ago, some of the methods of education are as terrifying as those of the previous ruling class, now impoverished nobility - not the least bit less brutal than before.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a new-age soft drink.
0.5 per cent mandatory for heads of state
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who receive a salary from the state for their work, but also those self-conscious people who do politics voluntarily (read: deliberately): write opinion banners using the image of Mihkel Muti, debate on Facebook while the terrible people around them live here in Estonia, picket, boycott, juggle, sabotage.
They are only willing to be in the echo chamber (a term for people who live in a room where only they have opinions, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but in conflict-ridden Estonia this is not possible.
There's always someone in the room who thinks or does something that the kayakers can't stand.
And there's a war of words and sparrow cannons are roaring.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much a person can drink, who they can sleep with, how many children they can have, how to work, how much they can get paid, when to rest, what to think about, what to eat, how to entertain themselves, when to get sick, how to die.
Very important places.
If their public statements are contradicted by anything other than what they said, they are angry, offended, hysterical.
The fact that in many European countries people drive with their heads full, and this is permitted by law, does not change their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance allowed in any field, but behind zero tolerance is not caring, it's a misunderstanding.
Class hatred and racism, only people like me are good.
The politicians of the church can only open their mouths, but never their hearts.
They believe that any "measure" they take to improve society will work and is worth trying.
Fortunately for them, we have enough of a guard force of glittering, mindless cascades that jump through every window - painless.
So we think that if some smart peasant opens his mouth and gets beaten up for it in the mansion, emotionally disabled, that's reasonable.
Some of the words that are definitely going to send us to the mansion are gay, refugee, woman, violence, work, etc.
If you believe everything self-serving officials, activists, and politicians (there are only a small number of such groups, but they can make the whole society deaf) say and write, you are not only disgusting, vile, and unpleasant, but you are brainless, brainless.
But let's not believe, let's not tolerate coercion, let's not forbid the drinking.
In any case, an Estonian drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state allows.
In any case, an Estonian tolerates more than he is forced to tolerate.
An Estonian does not change his behavior two months before the election in order to turn his back on his popularity diet after achieving the goal and again not only put in but also expel what unpleasant brain fat cells quickly recover.
Anyone who does otherwise is not a true Estonian.
I don't think any human can be re-educated.
I believe that a man can be taught.
Drinking wisely, loving your family, being hardworking, polite, charming companion not just to your friends but to the community at large.
Teaching doesn't have to be about fining, restricting, banning, forcing, disciplining, cornering, throwing rotten eggs in the media mail all the time.
A teacher must be a role model.
A politician who smokes is talking about the harm of tobacco?
A speeding cop on his own time is gonna give me a speeding ticket?
And then he gets caught drinking with his colleague...
I have this humble idea that maybe we should try to re-educate the ruling class.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
When you drink, drink in public, in the town hall square, in full view of the people.
To force speeding only in public - ruling cars, even private cars, all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourself.
Maybe shame is enough when words and deeds don't match.
Or we may find that we want to be ruled by the most corrupt.
Because all of us Estonians are what we don't want to be.
Running away from yourself?
Leaking Trump transcripts is likely a federal crime, according to former prosecutors.
Whoever leaked the transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press likely committed a crime, former prosecutors said Thursday as lawmakers called for a guilty verdict.
"It is a crime to release these documents to the press without authorization", former District Attorney of Columbia Joe diGenova told Fox News.
These various acts, which include the publication of notes and transcripts of conversations between the President and foreign leaders, pose a serious threat to national security.
The Washington Post reported on Thursday, based on leaked documents, new details of Trump's tense phone calls with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in late January.
The first one, Trump allegedly ordered the Mexican president to stop publicly announcing that his government would not pay for the border wall.
The newspaper said the transcripts contained notes that suggested the head of the National Security Council had been keeping them secret.
The Post said they had received complete transcripts "compiled by White House staff" based on White House correspondents.
"There is a federal statute that makes it a crime to leak classified information to an unauthorized person, a federal crime", former New York State Attorney Doug Burns said in a telephone interview.
While some of these conversations were made public in February, the release of the transcripts marks a much bigger blow to the White House's efforts to reduce the leaks.
The report was released coincidentally as senior Trump administration officials prepared to go public on Friday to demonstrate their commitment to rooting out classified leakers.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina are expected at Justice Department headquarters to brief the public on the situation.
It's not clear if the Justice Department is investigating the leak.
To hold someone accountable, Burns says, "certain elements must be clearly demonstrated".
He said "there could be a lot of confusion on this", referring to the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and her decision not to press charges.
These considerations include the marking and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the event of classification, prosecutors will investigate whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a manner that adversely affects the interests of the United States.
"If all this can be proven, people could be in a definitely criminally vulnerable situation", Burns said.
"No doubt about it".
Speaking about transcripts of Trump's phone calls, diGenova, who prosecuted espionage cases, said such documents are "usually classified and higher".
Claiming that these leaks threaten the ability of the United States government to conduct foreign policy, DiGenova asked the Attorney General to convene a federal criminal grand jury to find the leakers.
He also said that a court order would be required to obtain the phone records of reporters and editors of The Washington Post - something that reporters would no doubt protest.
Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah said on Capitol Hill Thursday that a leak of classified information should be prosecuted.
"The person who leaked it must be found, punished and fired", Lee told Fox News' "America's News HQ".
"This is unacceptable and should never happen".
Lee, who practiced law before being elected to the Senate in 2010, called such a leak a "crime, a very serious federal crime".
'This should not and should not be accompanied by dismissal alone, but also criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved,' he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage Friday's Justice Department announcement may provide a glimpse of what the Justice Department hopes to achieve rather than clarify specific procedures.
Last week, he criticized President Sessions and publicly poured his anger on the Attorney General, saying he had not done enough to find the leakers.
"I want the attorney general to be much tougher on leaks coming from security agencies", Trump said in Rossiya on July 25.
Sessions himself admitted last week to Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the efforts to investigate the leaks that have repeatedly hampered the president since his inauguration.
"I have not been satisfied with the previous proceedings and investigations into criminal leaks", Sessions said.
Even some critics of the president have spoken out against the leaks, saying that such behavior harms foreign policy efforts.
"The leak of a transcript of a call between the president and a foreign head of state is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous", wrote David Frum in the Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is of the utmost importance that the president be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can respond confidentially".
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the top Democrat on the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was "absolutely" concerning and should be investigated by Congress.
10 underhanded advertising tricks to make food look more appealing
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the photograph uses other ingredients that deceive people - such as glue instead of milk or potato butter instead of ice cream.
YouTube channel Top Trending provides an overview of the tricks that are quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a popcorn box or takes out a burger from a commercial, a lot of nice vapor comes out.
In reality, the time taken to cook is longer and hot food does not evaporate during that time because the steam comes from the high water content, which is not present in, for example, stews.
Therefore, the packaging or food contains water-soaked cotton balls that have the ability to absorb and retain water.
When they are close to the heat exchange, they will last much longer than a burger or popcorn and give the product a freshly made appearance.
Potato powder is a great help to photographers because it does not melt in the presence of light or heat and does not significantly alter its consistency, as many other foods do.
For example, instead of a cream filling or a frosty ice cream, a cake may contain a powdered potato.
A little paint and decorative elements and the consumer is fooled again.
Glue replaces milk.
Milk is also not easy to photograph because it may not look so white in a photo.
Also, foods served with milk quickly turn into starch.
Since cereals, for example, must look crunchy and taste good inside milk, glue is used instead, which does not penetrate any of the skins.
While restaurants can go to great lengths to make the meat juicy and well-cooked, advertisements do not.
Yet, the meat that is advertised is the one that looks particularly appealing, as if it had come straight from the grill.
Often, however, it is prepared by frying or baking in an oven and then drawing stripes on the meat that mimic grilling with a shoe.
The powdered peel is as hard to work as the ice cream because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical in appearance to a powdered peel - shaving cream.
So it could be in a commercial on a cake or berries or in a milkshake.
Even fruit sold in a store may have a thin layer of wax on the surface that makes it look more shiny.
But for the photo, that's not enough. The fruit is sprayed with deodorant to add sparkle.
The sauces are also less photogenic, as they become more liquid or water-free over time.
Here, however, comes the wax, whose bright colors and more permanent texture allow for a seductive bust.
Wax is also likely to have been used in images of melted chocolate dripping on a cake or ice cream.
If you see a perfectly cut cake in an advertisement with a perfect ratio of biscuit to filling, there are probably some extra layers or pieces of paper used.
Because cutting the cake open can spread the lice and ruin the image.
If you push the pieces into the cake after cutting and sprinkle the filling on them, it will look much more beautiful.
The paper and button needle are also used inside the burger to precisely arrange all the ingredients in it to keep them in place.
That's why the burger on the table doesn't look like the one in the commercial.
Paper-fed chicken.
In the commercials, the oven looks juicy and full, but it may not even be ready to cook.
To give the impression of a filler, a full sheet of paper is dipped in chicken, ground with the potato powder mentioned above if necessary, and then simply sprayed with brown paint on the chicken.
Pancakes are especially popular in American commercials, where they are fried with maple syrup because it makes people crave pancakes.
In fact, the cakes absorb the syrup quickly, and the flowing syrup quickly disappears from the photographer's view.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning agent designed for the sofa bed to prevent rapid absorption.
Often, this is not helpful, so the solution is golden-brown motor oil, which is spread on hot pancakes and served as a syrup.
Former soldier sentenced to prison for the murder of a pensioner suspected of sexual abuse
An ex-soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of abusing a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy, 70, was convicted in June at Glasgow High Court of the murder of David Farish, 75, at his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire, in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers described the murder as "particularly brutal" as the victim had 14 stab wounds.
Attorney General Brian McConnachie, the defense attorney, said the killing was "momentary insanity", but described the circumstances as "extraordinary".
Cassidy heard that Farish had been sexually abusing a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said that the man went to the Pharisee's home and "friended" him in the hope of hearing a confession, not with the intention of killing him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy had demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack, and pointed to a social work report which revealed that the defendant had undergone military special forces training in how to infiltrate groups through friendship.
The Pharisee had not been charged with any crime.
The court heard that after the murder, Cassidy contacted the police and turned himself in.
McConnachie stated that most people have a "hard time understanding" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense lawyer said: "He has never had any problems in his life before this incident.
He lived a full life until that crazy moment in February of 2016.
Cassidy's reportedly in poor health and has suffered a heart attack and stroke while in custody.
According to Lord Summers, in order to sentence him to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years, he took into account Cassidy's lack of prior convictions and what he was allegedly told about Farish.
Police in Scotland described the case as "the particularly gruesome murder of a frail elderly man in his own home".
Investigator David Pinkney said: "While this punishment does not make his atrocity unnecessary, I hope it offers some sort of solution to David's family".
Monday was the last chance to come up with a nice name for a rhinoceros born in early June.
The zoos now have a big box full of names to go through to find the right one to announce on the zoo's birthday, August 25.
But the name of the boy is still open until Independence Day.
From early August, you will see a whole rhinoceros herd walking side by side in the garden.
And while Father Kigoma occasionally runs around in the important whistles and shakes garden poles with his horn, Mother Kibibi will not be disturbed, but the rhinoceros will learn valuable lessons.
Although the peak of the births is over, on August 1st, the light of day was seen by a young yak and two domestic guards for him.
On a hot summer day, the mound can be attacked by bathing eagles.
The takins, the distinctive-looking goats, were on the run.
Thursday was another Vivacolor color day at the zoo.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the garden posts of the large outdoor elephant garden, and the terrace for the elephant's father.
To avoid disturbing the painters, the mother elephants Fien and Draay once again spent time with the father elephant Carl.
On August 9, the second day of the classical triangle in the zoo, the Aovo Otsa trumpet ensemble will perform.
The zoo offers souvenirs of rhinos and herons and other fond memories.
The proceeds from the charity sale will go towards the conservation project concerned.
Last week's Tiger Day benefit raised over €1,000 for the charity.
Interestingly, how do you calculate the sugar content of dairy products?
'According to EU food labelling standards, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars can be listed on the packaging, but not in the same way as white, so-called table sugar,' confirmed Krista Kalbin, Valio's Estonian Marketing Director.
He says that dairy products actually contain three types of sugars: lactose, or natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose, or added sugar, or sucrose, in milk.
But Kalbin says that keeping a few simple basic truths in mind, calculating the amount of added sugars in a product should not be difficult.
It must first be ascertained whether the product is milk or acidified milk.
The average milk and milk drink contains about 5 grams of natural milk sugar, or 100 grams of lactose per product.
In acidified milk products, yogurt or kefir bacteria have consumed some lactose during the acidification process, resulting in an average of 3,5 g/100 g of lactose per product in acidified milk products.
"The first thing to do to calculate the amount of added sugar is to deduct lactose from the sugars", Kalbin said.
Now, the fructose and glucose from berries and fruits must be deducted from the sugar.
'In general, fructose and glucose are present in flavoured dairy products at a normal 3-4% fruit content of about 0.3 grams and particularly in berries at about 15% fruit content of up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams,' said Kalbin.
He said that this simple calculation shows that the added sugar content of berry yogurts can be up to twice that of the sugars indicated on the packaging.
The situation is slightly different for lactose-free products, as the sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the best spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna routines
The consumer service of the postman compared the best deals offered by the spas for one person on the night of 11-12 August.
'Spa hotels have different levels and service options, so it is very difficult to make one-to-one comparisons based on price alone,' said Mario Sau, Sales Manager at OÜ Spa Tours.
Comparing accommodation with spa facilities, it appears that the most favourable packages vary in price several times and offer options for both the more demanding customer and the more modest holidaymaker.
For example, if a single traveller can spend 51 euros in a single room in the Värska Spa water centre with a buffet breakfast and water park, gym and saunas, then a package with a companion to the Pädaste Manor in Muhumaal costs 287 euros per person.
It includes accommodation in a Double Deluxe room, breakfast at the Alexander Winter Garden restaurant and a half-day spa package of Choir and Water.
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be borne in mind that to get the best price, a vacation should be taken with a friend or companion, since a two-room stay is cheaper than a single room.
If you wish to rest alone, however, you can have either special single rooms or double rooms for an additional fee.
While it is common for a lone traveler to pay just a few hundred euros more for a single room, more economical options can be found by compromising.
For example, at Fra Mare Thalasso Spa in Haapsalu, a single room package costs 86 euros, but if you wish, you can also stay in a double room at a lower rate, provided that you have been informed in advance that someone else will be accommodated if there is no room.
In this case, the price of the package shall be EUR 58.
The best deal is to be flexible.
Package prices are dynamic, perhaps dependent on the day of the week and the volume.
'The most favourable package can range in price from EUR 112 to EUR 248', explained the sales and marketing manager of V SpaaHotel in Tartu, Triinu Teras, about their pricing policy.
It also pointed out that the price in their hotels varies depending on the level of occupancy and added that in general the customer can get the best price by booking directly on their website or by asking for a quote.
Since the summer season is the busiest for spas, it is worth planning ahead to avoid a situation where the desired space is sold out.
For example, on 11 August, the Pärnu Hedon Spa and the Strand Spa were chosen for the comparison of packages, and the conference hotel only has suites and the Vihula mansion in the Lakhmaal is also sold out.
You don't have to look far to find a relaxing holiday: almost every major city in Estonia has one or more spas.
It is also worthwhile to research before buying a package, and avoid having a major event nearby at the same time, as this will raise prices immediately.
For example, from 11 to 13 August, the White Lady events will take place in Haapsalu.
At this time of year, Haapsalu is very busy with tourists, demand for accommodation is very high, and we have high rates for large events.
"So we don't have any cheap accommodation or package deals on sale at this time", commented Irene Väli, manager of the spa hotel Laine.
A Chinese company that came to Mullu Estate made a turnover of 100 million euros immediately.
Agritera, a Chinese-owned agricultural seller that started operations only last year, achieved a turnover of almost EUR 100 million.
The profit was almost 2 million euros, writes Business Day.
The company's annual report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ, which is engaged in buying-in and wholesale of agricultural products, amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
The profit was EUR 1,91 million.
The company had no economic activity a year earlier.
The company employed an average of 3 people at the time and had no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee was EUR 33,6 million, with an average gross wage of EUR 316 per month.
Jury Kolk: rest all year round, so you don't need a holiday
Of course, it was my fault that this vacation didn't go well.
I guess I was a little needed, but I guess I was the only one who thought he was irreplaceable.
It's my own fault for having a stupid sense of duty spread in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is beautiful in that it is completely true.
Yes, the new job I started in March of that year required some work, but something about it suited me so much better that in three months I was well into a whole new life, resting.
It's summer already, it's time for the holidays.
It's time to make New Year's resolutions, to look back at what's happened in your life and where this whole thing is going.
"That's what Christmas and New Year's are for!" some decent citizen angrily shouts.
Maybe it is, but we all know from experience that Christmas is not a time to reflect on life and set goals.
Okay, I'm just speaking for myself. I can't make any changes on New Year's Eve.
This is too hard for me.
Of course, there is joy and happiness in the Christmas season: I like to know about the triumph of light, I like Christmas cards, and Jesus was also a very sympathetic, revolutionary man.
Yet, I am usually very tired and sometimes stressed during Christmastime - just because it is dark.
Yeah, I do a lot of work in a vacation life, maybe more than I would in a fucking slaughterhouse, and I've been resting pretty much all the time.
Most of the time, I've been running around like a squirrel on a wheel - presents, at least four Christmas parties, a little bit more workload...
When you also consider the constant social pressure to feel joy and peace in your heart, the difficulties of Christmastime are obvious.
But a desperate and tired person can't make good decisions, let alone perfect them into a plan.
You gotta do these things with a clear head.
A tired person may throw away a hollow, sound promise that will help him lay a foundation for the future about as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise to change something should be thought through calmly, it should be profitable, it should be a plan.
A plan, unlike a promise, has a purpose and a guide and is not broken by a few small setbacks.
That's why I say the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to relax and find out why this fatigue is so great (if any).
Unless you commit to a vacation like a calf that escapes the table, you'll have a few weeks to find a hook in your life worth straightening out and figure out exactly how to do it.
I think it's important to live as long as possible without needing a vacation, so I can rest on a regular basis, not once a year.
So that vacation is an added benefit, not a necessary survival boxing stop, during which you recharge yourself just enough to somehow last the next year.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, go to bed early at night.
I believe that if every tenth reader of the Postman took my advice, life in Estonia would improve significantly.
I'm going to take my own advice.
We've already got a Thursday workweek, but not the one we're looking for.
The office is open.Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd.
Many Estonians already have a Thursday workweek that they have longed for, without even knowing it.
But not the one they'd expect, Business Day reports.
It's created by modern office planning, or open office.
According to the prestigious management magazine Harvard Business Review, an office without walls takes an employee nearly 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full workday a week.
But if the Thursday workweek is understood to mean four working days and three rest days, such a forced solution is worse.
The 1.5 hours of work time taken from family and hobbies or rest are replaced by recovery time with difficulty concentrating, work-related disruption, increased irritability and anxiety, and the loss of work.
The third day of the festival weekend will be a strong wind.
Thus, a struggling kayaker, trying to fly in the face of the wind, was caught on camera by a Evening Standard photographer.
Because of the windy weather, many festival-goers also sniff that their mouths and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a $51 million theme park for his daughter
A father in Texas found that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on a family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they were scared because they don't know how to treat a person with a disability -- Morgan has five years of cognitive understanding and also a form of autism.
That incident haunted him.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Seeing her always brings a smile to her face and she's definitely eager to hug.
But there have been many times when we have not been able to take him to different places", she says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere she would feel comfortable and others would feel comfortable associating with her.
"We came to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place", says Hartman.
So in 2007, he decided to build it himself.
The former real estate developer sold his homebuilding businesses in 2005 to start The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a nonprofit that helps people with disabilities.
Then he set out to create "the world's first fully accessible theme park".
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything, where people with and without disabilities can play", says Hartman.
He invited doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and disadvantaged people to consult on the facility.
They were erected on a 10-acre abandoned quarry in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, called Morgan's Wonderland, cost $34 million (£26 million) and opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible viewing platform, an adventure playground and a miniature train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that it was the first time they had been able to experience such attractions.
There is also a carousel with wheelchair-accessible carriages that move up and down alongside the animals.
But Hartman admits that Morgan was initially nervous about driving.
"When we opened it, he didn't dare go in.
He couldn't understand why it was spinning and why the animals were moving up and down", says Hartman.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go on the carousel.
"At first he just stood near it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the car.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to ride it.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot to him.
The little things you accomplish in games make a big difference".
Since opening, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over a million people from 67 countries and all 50 states.
One third of the staff are disabled and admission is free for anyone with a medical condition.
"I realized that Morgan is one of the lucky ones because she has many things that she needs.
I didn't want the price to be a barrier for other people with special needs", says Hartman.
"We open every year knowing that we will lose at least a million dollars (£750,000) and have to make up for it with the help of collectors and partners".
This year, the theme park was expanded with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs got too hot.
So we decided to build a water park next to it", says Hartman.
In some parts of the island, hot water has been used to help visitors with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorized wheelchairs are available that run on compressed air, not batteries.
You can also take a boat ride on the river.
The total cost of the water park was $17 million (£13 million).
"Yesterday a man came to me on Inspiration Island and just held my hand", says Hartman.
"She pointed to her son, who has serious special needs, and started to cry.
She said her son had never been allowed to play in the water before".
Hartman claims that three out of every four park visitors are not disabled and that the park has exactly the impact he hoped it would have.
"It helps people to see that although we are different in some ways, we are actually exactly the same", he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl with no special needs and they started playing together.
It was really cool".
Hartman has no plans to open any more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by mail and e-mail from people who want a park in their neighborhood.
Instead, he's focused on providing educational facilities for special needs youth in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organisations trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere, and we will continue to work with them", he adds.
He keeps taking Morgan to the theme park to play, and Morgan's a celebrity now.
"When he comes in here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, and he does it well", says Hartman.
Morgan, now 23, is getting better at things.
"He now talks more, and most of his physical problems have been resolved by numerous surgeries.
We're so proud of him for getting this far".
When Morgan visits the park, his favorite activities are playing on the slides and sandbars, not realizing how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows the park is named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives", Hartman says.
"He doesn't realize that the way he's handled things in life has made him a real inspiration".
Head coach of the U18 team Vaido Rego: the play-off game may be decided by one or two throws
Estonia's U18 basketball team defeated Poland 68-63 in the quarterfinals of the B-division, a real play-off match, according to head coach Vaido Rego.
The game was rough.
Both teams had done their homework, scoring hard.
The game is about who has the better nerves.
The play-offs can be a one-two punch", Rego argued.
You win, but the coach always looks for improvements first.
There's always a laughing stock.
Some of our mistakes were unjustified, the enemy got light free throws and lived on them.
We've been there before. When you're aggressive on defense, you risk overdoing it.
We draw our own conclusions", said Rego.
He used nine players today, and Robin Kiwi, who missed a few games with an injury, was still on the bench.
These decisions are made on the fly.
The stone was used for the morning training and warm-up before the game, but it was still not 100 percent ready", explained the coach.
Tomorrow at 6:15 pm, Estonia will face Great Britain in the semi-finals, who today defeated Bulgaria 76-73.
The winner of this game will be promoted to the EMI A division for the U18 age group next summer.
Video: Vassilyev has already missed his second penalty for his new club
Piast was left out of the game in the ninth minute against Wrocław Slask, but managed to win 20 minutes later.
Vassilyev had a great chance to secure Piast's first win of the season.
Four minutes before normal time, the midfielder missed a penalty.
The game ended 1-1.
Pias has scored two points in four rounds and is in the penultimate place in the standings, 15th.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it's very important to keep the passion alive as you try to build a new life.
Female First offers advice on how to make sex not feel like a chore.
Don't take it as a commitment.
It can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it can take years to get pregnant.
Having sex on command takes away the spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel unable to enjoy "normal" sex at the end of a cycle when they know that it will not be a positive outcome.
This creates tension in the relationship, which in turn leads to less sex, and less sex, of course, means even more chances of not getting pregnant.
Men, however, feel that they must be able to "perform" when they are asked to.
Knowing ahead of time what your fertile days will be can help you to plan for romantic activities with your loved one.
Whether it's a special dinner or just a little time together, enjoy each other!
Consider the fertile period.
From a reproductive standpoint, there is no point in having sex after ovulation, but to make your relationship flourish, try to have sex on the days after the infertility.
While there is no evidence that pregnancy is more likely to occur if a woman also has an orgasm, remember this!
Remember, every couple is different.
Everyone copes with the stress of childbearing differently.
Some men want to be aware of a woman's cycle, while others prefer not to be so they don't feel the pressure to "perform on demand".
No one knows what's best for you better than you do.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every few days have a higher chance of success, but not every couple can maintain that intensity.
The most important thing is to find the pattern that works best for you as a couple.
The IAAF warns that cheating at the London World Championships will be closely monitored
With the World Championships in Athletics opening in London on Friday, athletes are in the spotlight more than ever over the doping scandal.
These World Championships are the first to be overseen by a new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and match-fixing.
"It cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
But we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping programme that can be based on the information and data that we have collected at the moment, and we will see the results after the event", said AIU representative David Howman.
The AIU has allowed 19 of the approximately 190 Russian athletes caught with drugs to compete as neutral athletes.
Levadia defeated Paide City on home soil.
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position, as in the previous round, the stranger was surprisingly defeated by the Future Fruit and the leader of the table Flora took advantage of the opportunity offered, slipping already seven points away.
But from behind, the same stick as Levadia has reached the Mudstone.
Paide, who was locked up in the summer transfer window, still misses captain and midfielder Andre Frolov.
The last seven games have only taken two points, the eighth in the league table - Tartu Tammekas with four points behind and Future in turn with four points ahead.
Paide lost to Levadia in the first game of the season, 0-7 and the second game, 2-5.
"My watch died, but not me", smiled actor Raivo E. Tamme at the Ironman 70.3 finish.
True, during the entire half-long triathlon, the smile didn't tend to leave Ravo behind.
Further, after running 13.5 miles [21.1 km], she was in a conversation: "I was talking to someone while I was running, and a man ran by and said, 'Oh, my God, you can still talk!'
During the long distance run, Raivo, who had the energy to talk, crossed the highway several times.
- Coach recommended it.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk up the hill, that there is no point in pushing running, because there are such climbs and in time it makes no difference whether you run or do a sprint", says the actor, who took advice from a triathlon instructor.
He also got to breathe during the walk, and so he was able to do interviews left and right without breathing after crossing the finish line.
It's like I didn't have a mile swim, a mile bike ride, and a mile run.
"I think my training is going to be so that I can enjoy this race", admits Raivo, who started training in January and has lost 16 kilograms [16 lb] to date.
And as for the interviews, it was my wish to be able to do them after the finish.
I've been able to do interviews after every race, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do it after the Ironman.
I thought that I would be fine if I wasn't on the ground after the Ironman". In contrast with the scary, wet-down situation, Raivo crossed the finish line with a different picture: his hands triumphantly up in the air and his face glowing with genuine triumph.
There was a reason: Raivol swam a 1.9-kilometer [1.9 km] in 46 minutes and 24 seconds, cycled a 90-kilometer [90 km] in 3 hours and 32 minutes, and ran a 21.1-kilometer [21.1 km] in 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart is now in triathlon", says Raivo, who cried out at the finish line that he gave the sport a finger and it took the ring.
Already on August 20, I registered for the Gran Fondo - a bicycle ride of some 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu!
So, we'll get back to practice tomorrow!
Disney's longtime advisor and executive Marty Sklar has died at the age of 83.
Sklar, who died on July 27 at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained ties to the company after retiring in 2009, timed to coincide with the 54th anniversary of Disneyland's opening.
Last year, he became the only cast member (now called the company's employees) to have participated in the opening of all 12 Disney Parks worldwide at the Shanghai Disneyland opening in China.
And less than two weeks before his death, he attended the Disney fan convention D23, sharing his memories of Disneyland.
His death was announced by the Disney Company without giving a cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's position as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's primary variator in writing promotional materials, dedications, souvenir guides, speeches, slogans, presentations, and short films, such as the script that helped the company get approval to build Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"These were pretty dizzying times for someone who was just approaching his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years left of college", Sklar wrote in his autobiography Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms (2013).
However, despite Walt Disney's trust in Sklar's writing, he assigned Sklar to the Ford Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where the Disney Company designed exhibits and attractions.
Sklar wrote a story for Walt Disney for the Magic Skyway attraction at the Ford Pavilion, where animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen could be seen and which was their main link to major corporate sponsors.
This was the beginning of Sklar's second review of the company.
As an increasingly important member and leader of Imagineers, he became increasingly associated with the legacy of Walt Disney, who died in late 1966, well before Walt Disney World opened in 1971 and Epcot opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at age 65, Sklar was thrust back into the world of writing when he was told that company executives had not prepared a public speech, although "it was no secret that Walt was dying", as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar said she was upset that she had to write the statement that Roy Disney would sign, but she realized that the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company executives.
"In reality, they were all scared to death", Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
His father, Leon, was a teacher and his mother, maiden name Lilyn Fuchs, worked for Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach, California, when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had several temporary jobs, including working at Douglas Aircraft, as an ice cream confectioner at a hamburger drive-in, and as a mail carrier.
But in May 1955, as his third year at U.C.L.A. was coming to a close, Sklar received a text telling him to call Disney marketing and advertising manager E. Cardon Walker.
At the time, Sklar was the new editor of the UCLA student newspaper, The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come in for a job interview for the creator and editor of The Disneyland News.
Walker said the theme park's opening soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
But Sklar also had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I had been working there for two weeks and had to present a concept for a magazine to Walt Disney", he recalled on a podcast on the Disney Avenue website.
"If Walt hadn't liked it, he would have thrown me out and hired a professional.
But luckily, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
It was scary.
I had never worked at a professional level".
Sklar at one point formulated Walt Disney's (and some other people's) lessons as the "Miki for Ten Commandments", or theme park board manifesto.
The instructions include the following:
Try to "get in the visitors' shoes" to experience the attraction as they do.
Tell only one story at a time for each attraction.
Entertainment expert Bob Rogers once called Sklar "the wizard's apprentice" - a role played by Mickey Mouse in Disney's 1940 film "Fantasy" - because he had instilled Disney's philosophy into three generations of designers.
Sklar is survived by his wife, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren.
Sklar was a dedicated Disney executive.
He regularly wore a Mickey Mouse watch with three dials (which showed him the time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a Mickey Mouse gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When the Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park children's area, Sklar reminded the planners to include activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had requested.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed because Walt used to take his daughters Diane and Sharon Griffith to a carousel ride in a park", he told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Dad would sit on the park bench and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids drove alone".
Police brought over 200 people into the station over the weekend.
In total, more than 20 crimes were registered in the city of Pärnu during the festival.
About half of these were related to a music party, and in addition to violence, there were large amounts of drug possession and two DUI cases.
One hundred of the offences were mainly related to the consumption or possession of alcohol by minors or of prohibited substances.
Got some mail about some theft and public order violations.
Law enforcement brought over 200 people to the police station for various reasons.
About half of them were minors, and alcohol was the main reason for their being brought to the police station.
I had half the number of minors brought into the precinct.
The crib also took half a dozen people, perhaps as many as last year.
According to Andres Sinimer, head of the Pärnu police department, the above figures are reasonable, given the large crowd.
As in previous years, we had a thorough preparation for this weekend.
We've added additional forces from other prefectures, police stations and auxiliary police to ensure a rapid response.
Most of the cases were resolved by word of mouth and the interaction between law enforcement and citizens was sufficient.
"Apparently, so many crimes were avoided because we felt that the police were seen and felt in the city quite a lot", Sinimeri said.
He was extremely positive that the number of minors who drank was significantly lower and that young people proved that partying can be done soberly.
He praised the top-notch security team at the festival site.
I want to thank all the festival guests for being so polite and having a safe party.
"I also thank the local people who, with their understanding, contributed to the success of the big festival", said the police chief.
The Pärnu police station is waiting for the owners of the items found in the city and festival area this weekend.
Annika Pärna, the head of the Pärnu service responsible for returning the finds at the festival site, said that this year there were fewer lost items than yesterday.
In the festival area police van, more than half of the finds were returned to their owners.
The most lost items in three days were bank cards, identity documents, cell phones and keys.
"At the moment, 13 mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smartwatch and several car keys are waiting for the owner at the station", Pärna listed.
A 101-year-old man jumped out of a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes was recently awarded the Military Medal in commemoration of his world record-breaking parachute jump.
A man committed rape at the age of 101 years and 38 days, making him the oldest person to parachute into space.
Business groups urge government to agree Brexit transition terms
One of Britain's largest business lobby groups is urging the government to stop dancing around the periphery of Brexit.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) asked the government to conclude a 'transition agreement' to make Brexit a smooth transition.
It is recommended that the government bridge the "Brexit gap" between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements.
The Group warned that without such an agreement, business would face a 'short-term chaotic cliff-edge swing'.
They criticized the government for being "involved in all kinds of speculative disputes regarding the transition".
In recent weeks, members of the government have expressed conflicting views about how long the transition period will last and what it will entail.
The IoD report, 'Brexit Gap - Opportunities for Transition', says: 'Rather than just brush aside the problem, the government needs to generate a strategic debate on the issue.
This could minimise the ever-increasing confusion and uncertainty in this area.'
Gerard Lyons, an economist and leader of the Economists for Brexit group, described this week the worry about a "rock-bottomed" Brexit as "a panic-mongering tale", reminiscent of the Y2K fear of a computer bug at the turn of the millennium.
Vice Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a huge amount of business investment that is being put off until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is".
Allie Renison, Head of EU and Trade Policy at the IOC, said: 'The Chancellor has a right to be concerned about the drag on business investment.
This is one of the most frequently discussed changes to be addressed in the context of Brexit, alongside the relocation of functions within the EU.
The latter applies in particular to members of the IOD based in Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-location or relocation.'
The IoD offers several options, including the following:
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to remain longer in the governance of EU legislation
The establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU customs union
Renison said: 'The IOA proposed these options in the context of the transition, hoping that this would ignite a proper debate on how best to complete Brexit.
Prioritizing interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of leaving the EU means that short-term chaotic edge shifts do not diminish future opportunities.'
Russian Railways to explore the possibility of a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin commuter train
Russian Railways is investigating the possibility of running a Berlin-St. Petersburg railway line through Kaliningrad, the director of the Kaliningrad railway, Viktor Golomolzin, told Interfax Severo-Zapad.
The travel monitoring indicates that the reopening of the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains is hardly economically feasible.
And we offer a second route, Berlin-Kaliningrad-St. Petersburg.
The technical possibilities for this exist both in terms of infrastructure and rolling stock,' said Golomolzin.
The Commission also noted that the Russian trains already existed, which could change track width and continue to operate on European track width.
Golomolzin believes that this is a viable option because residents of St. Petersburg and the entire northwest of Russia now have to travel to Germany via Moscow and Brest.
The route through Latvia is being discussed as a possible option, confirmed Latvian Delfi's spokesperson for Latvian Railways (Latvijas Dzelzceļš) Māris Ozols, who said that no concrete decision is currently available but that the option is being discussed.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measures in question are imputable to the State.
Pakistanis Hindus are not safe in India
70 years after the largest migration in history, which began with the separation of the two countries, Hindus are still moving from Pakistan to India.
Already, tens of thousands of people without even legal rights to work in India are waiting in the camps along the border between the two countries.
Many have no choice but to work illegally in quarries near temporary shelters, whereas Indian authorities monitor the movement of migrants very closely.
Most people who come from Pakistan don't expect this kind of welcome.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
We worked the fields, we were farmers.
Here, people like us are forced to dig rocks to make a living", said Jogdas, 81.
The split is not over for us.
The Indians are still trying to get back to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing", added an elderly man living in a camp near the city of Jodhpur.
After India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
Secession sparked months of violence, in which religious hatred claimed the lives of at least a million people.
In the midst of bloody chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled from the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the exodus, Hindus remain one of Pakistan's largest minority groups.
Various estimates put them at about 1.6 percent of the country's 200 million people.
Many complain of constant discrimination and fear of kidnapping, rape, and forced marriage.
"The persecution began soon after the separation", said Jogdas, whose family moved to areas of what is now Pakistan to escape drought just months before the two countries separated.
Not a day went by that we could live in peace.
I wanted to come back to live my life among my brothers.
The national government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said it wants to make it easier for people persecuted for religious reasons to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government began allowing immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence, previously all the procedures were done through the central government.
Hindus who have relocated from Pakistan to India will be granted fast-track citizenship after seven years of residence in the country.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often considerably more time-consuming.
Khanaramji, 64, left Pakistan in 1997 and became an Indian citizen in 2005.
But many, he says, have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that they will not have a good life in India.
The government is not offering any support.
We're like cattle without a master.
We are just trying to survive on our own", Khanaramji said.
But even worse than poverty is skepticism from the authorities.
Those without citizenship must endure harassment by intelligence agencies.
They are always treated as suspects and Pakistani agents", he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who founded a charity in Jodhpur dedicated to helping Pakistan-born Hindus, had high hopes for Modi when he came to power in 2014, but has now been disappointed.
Under the Modi government, tensions between India and Pakistan have risen, and migrants are the ones who are suffering the most.
"Their lives will be hell", Sodhal said.
But for many, even that treatment is better than living in Pakistan.
Horoji fled to India with her two adult sons two years ago after receiving death threats from her Pakistani neighbors.
"We had to flee to India to save our lives", said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents came from parts of what is now India but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country was divided.
My grandfather moved across town for work.
But he told us that the time was right to move to India because he sensed that the future might be dangerous for the Indians.
I think we've been doing pretty well.
We have done our jobs and our business well", says Pärnu Police Chief Andres Sinimeri, describing how the first two days of the weekend have gone for them.
Sinimeri says that today there are patrol officers and first responders on the streets, and they also interact with people - perhaps with questions and wanting to know how to become first responders.
In the last two days, the police have been dealing with some fights and drug cases.
"There have been some large-scale drug deals, but we will make a summary after the weekend", Sinimeri says.
About 100 people have been to the Pärnu police station in the last two days.
Fortunately, the police have not had to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Blue Sea says if it rains sharply and horizontally from the sky, they don't have much work.
A Haapsalu police field commander once said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The police have also set up a staff in the area of the weekend where you can take your lost things and claim them.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary tricks, which good people brought to the scene.
Look at the video of what Andres Sinimer told the Evening Standard.
Emmy-nominated writer and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in the Hollywood Hills West that traces its roots back to the atomic age.
The mid-century modernist house was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named the Wohlstetter House after its original owners, nuclear weapons strategists Albert and Robert Wohlstetter.
Located by a gated driveway, the 9,000-square-foot [255 sq m] house has wide glass sliding doors that lead to the garden, terrace, and courtyard.
The living and dining rooms have cork floors, a fireplace, and portable panels that open onto the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
The building also has a separate guesthouse overlooking a giant fish pond and a sleeping porch.
There's also a bathroom and an additional storage room in the separate building.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Robert Wohlstetter's analysis of intelligence failures before Pearl Harbor was also cited by the 9/11 Commission.
The Wohlstetter family has advised both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
They were awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work on the television dramas "The Emergency Room" and "In the Name of the Law: The Sex Crimes Unit".
The real estate agents were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane of Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez of Keller Williams Realty.
The plane painted a perfect picture of itself over the United States.
The pilot took the airliner on a grueling cross-country flight over the United States, even having some fun along the way.
The real-time flight path data of the aircraft indicated that it was not a straight line or a curve, but a sequence of flight paths that, when combined, formed an image of the aircraft.
Flight BOE004 departed from Boeing Field Airport in Seattle at approximately 3:40 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to Flightradar 24.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner headed east over Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before abruptly changing course and flying south.
The plane's strange course on the map represents a twin-engine passenger jet.
Boeing says the flight is part of an 18-hour "endurance" test of the aircraft.
"Rather than flying a random pattern, the test team used their imagination to fly a 787-8 in 22 states", a Boeing spokesman told RT.com.
"The nose of the Dreamliner points to the Puget Sound area, home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
The wings extend from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
Saba is about Huntsville, Alabama", he added.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009.
The aircraft can carry up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13,600 kilometres.
Because the pilot used the radar as a personal lock, the flight generated immense interest among online flight trackers.
Some suspected it was a test flight, while others suggested it might be a strange coincidence.
Cartoons influencing the way Estonian children dress
While in Europe and America children's clothes are often shaped by what children of royalty or celebrities wear, Estonian parents choose their children's clothes based on what is happening in the cinema.
Britain's little Prince George is about to become a real fashion icon, modeled after his mother, the Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, the prince can trigger a real shopping frenzy in people with his clothes, which has even become a term in its own right - the Prince George effect.
The latest such incident occurred a few weeks ago during a visit by the royal family to Poland, where George wore a ten-euro blue-red striped shirt from the Spanish brand Tizza, which his crazed parents bought from the brand's online store within 24 hours.
There were probably not many Estonian shoppers among them, since the songs of the king's children supposedly leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, the department store's communications director, says that the children of celebrity couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not influence our parents' purchases for their children.
In Estonia, the biggest indicator of buying children's goods are movies, cartoons and also YouTube channels.
So the most popular products in recent years are fingerprints, "Frozen" cartoon characters, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, croaking penguins, and so on".
At the same time, he says that if they wish, they can dress their children in the same way as European princes and princesses.
The Centre Party does not recommend a Savisaare ready union
The leaders of the Centre Party regions across Estonia made an appeal to the public and party members to vote for the Centre Party, not the electoral unions.
This message is especially for those who are weighing between the Edgar Savisaare Electoral Union and the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana Used Her Makeup as a Weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing that comes to mind is eye cream.
A girl's blue at a young age.
Later, a thick black streak of her Martin Bashir "Panorama" interview, which had a devastating effect, as she looked up through the fat eyelashes, bringing to the audience the immortal phrase, "We were three in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded".
The large, wet eyes, surrounded by his pale face with a thick black line, gave him the impression of a wounded animal.
That's exactly the effect he was trying to achieve.
In public, Princess Diana never wore much makeup, at least not by modern standards.
Not only did she not need it - she was beautiful, of course - but she saw it as a tireless duty, something more work than pleasure.
In public, she could wear a thick layer of makeup.
One day, she arrived at the offices of Condé Nast, Vogue, wearing a thick, almost orange, layer of whipped cream.
He apologized, saying that his skin had to glow like a sunbeam because if he went out "normally", the cameramen would take pictures of him and then make all the accusations that he looked "sick", "ugly", and "tired".
For this reason, Diana went to the tanning salon three times a week, using a machine in her home.
While such a course would be considered wrong for health reasons today, for Diana it served a useful purpose - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though her interior was filled with black clouds and thunder.
Probably one of the royal family's biggest mistakes was thinking that if they approved of her as Charles' wife, they would get a beautiful little egg with nothing but cotton candy in it.
The reality was quite the opposite.
He may not have been the best in his class, but when it came to image-making, he was a straight-A student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey mood or emotion.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have any interest in them.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godmother of his youngest child - recalls that makeup was not something they used to talk about.
"I just remember", she said, "how much relief she felt when we went on vacations together and she didn't have to wear makeup".
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that enhances a woman's appearance, but looking back on Diana's life, it's clear that she used it as a powerful tool for relationship management.
The moments when she felt most free, most herself, are the moments when she was also most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with her two young sons, she was walking down the Loggers Leap in Thorpe Park, and she was soaking wet and laughing from the heart, her eyelashes spread like any other mother who spends her day with her children.
Four months after it was announced that she and Charles were separating, she finally looked defiantly carefree and "normal".
Or in later years, pulling himself out of the gym, his hair back, his legs in shape in his biking pants, his face flushed with exercise, his health and vitality blowing from every pore.
Towards the end of her life, as she began to put her independence to the test and her confidence grew, we saw more and more of this Diana.
He joined the Halo Trust and walked through an Angola minefield in January 1997.
At the time, at 35 years of age, her hair soft and natural, her face almost completely unmakeup-free, she was probably looking more beautiful than ever, reminiscent of that bright and hopeful young girl who smiled in her engagement photo 15 years ago.
Diana was just about to enter her prime.
In the early days, young Diana Spencer had a dreamlike pre-Raphaelite nature.
But it wasn't long before the "princessization" began, a process largely directed by the press and the palace to make Diana a refined young woman worthy of her new status.
It included, in part, the work of Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist who was often used by Lord Snowdon for photo shoots.
Howard met the fearful Diana for the first time at Snowdon's Kensington townhouse to capture an official engagement photo for Vogue magazine.
At that point, in the late 1980s, Diana was still a blank slate.
Her finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, like the Elderflower eyewear.
Howard used Max Factory's Sheer Genius cream with Honey Touch and Max Factory's Frosted Coral cheek gun.
She wore Elizabeth Arden's Rice and Timberland on her eyebrows and a white, tan leaf on her eyebrow.
The look was enhanced by Elizabeth Arden's blue eyelash mask and blue contour pencil.
And we know all this because Howard made a face for her.
"Diana's eyes are of such a wonderful colour that I wanted to emphasise their striking blue", he later wrote.
The end result, however, is not very appealing for such a young girl - she looks like an 18-year-old turning 50.
Her eyebrows are too oppressive and her eyes too dull brown.
But the most striking thing is the infamous eye shadow on the inner edge of the eye socket in this goofy Disney princess blue.
A fantasy for a fantasy girlfriend.
No wonder Diana's looking at us with a little uncertainty.
One of Diana's sources of anxiety was the fact that she never knew where the public person ended and the private one began.
That was the beginning of the process.
Perhaps the person who most influenced Diana's appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays a major role in the modern makeup world.
The makeup artist, now Chanel's successor, among others, remains one of the icons of the makeup world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs", he recalls.
"She was just beautiful.
The men adored her.
He was sexy without trying it".
Mary first met Diana in 1991 when Vogue's then-headliner Anna Harvey asked her to do her makeup for a December photo shoot with one of the magazine's most esteemed photographers, Patrick Demarchelier.
The team included hairdresser Sam McKnight.
This was at a time when Diana and Charles' marriage was at its worst and the public support for the couple was beginning to divide.
"They didn't tell us who it was, even though we knew it was someone very famous", Greenwell said.
"When we arrived, Diana was just standing there beautifully, warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on the cover of Vogue".
This cover photo - Diana in a simple black sweater, her chin resting on her hands, her bright blue eyes, elegant French manicure on her nails, her hair cut short - was breaking.
It radiated positivity, individuality and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, carrying on the cloned minimalist aesthetic of the early nineties, and creating a stark contrast between Diana and the royal family, who faced what the queen later called "dos horrible".
"Diana was very relaxed about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different", Greenwell said.
Over time, he taught Diana to apply makeup - cream, lotion, eye drops, eyelash massage - and to emphasize a healthy skin-care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the mantra "beauty within".
Diana "did everything in moderation", says Greenwell.
She's been getting enough sleep and cutting back on alcohol, which is very important for fresh-looking skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain's lotion, Clarins lipsticks and the Clinique's Wild Rose as a cheek.
But the greatest favor Mary ever did Diana was to deprive her of her blue eye dye.
"It just made her so much older", she said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft browns and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on the eyebrow border that were fused together so that all the edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he simply used a toning cream and a little sunscreen to enhance Diana's healthy glow.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to her place to discuss products that I really liked to make", Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for her; a chance to take a few moments to herself".
His favorite was the Clarins luxury brand.
Diana allegedly used their day and night cream for their sensitive skin and their alpine herbal cleanser and toner.
She also went to Janet Filderman's beauty salon in central London for regular facials.
Diana had notoriously beautiful skin, but she occasionally developed rosacea, a mild bruise that is often caused by stress.
To alleviate it, she used natural sedative oils, including pineapple oil.
"Diana had a remarkable bone structure", said Greenwell.
The only part of her appearance she wasn't very sure of was her nose.
"Once", recalls Anna Harvey, "when the newspapers reported that she had had nose surgery, she turned to me and said with a laugh, 'Honestly, if I had had my nose done, do you think I would have chosen this one?'"
As Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight's advice became more and more established, Diana felt more and more confident about her new appearance.
One of her most memorable public appearances - at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1994, wearing the famous "revenge charm", a provocative, shoulder-less, highlighted copy of Christina Stambolian's figure - shows that her signature style began to develop in her final years.
With her short hair, combed behind her ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her short hair in stark contrast to her very provocative black silk dress.
Her makeup is perfect - attractive yet modest, black eye polish to emphasize the blue of her eyes.
Not afraid of bright colors, especially red, he wore a bright red claw paint, most likely Revlon Red, which became a trademark in some ways.
A few months later, she flashed her elegant red manicure at the launch of the Child Loss Fund at the Royal College of Nursing.
The princess was a beacon of health and confidence.
And finally, he had complete control.
Up to date and in shape, her makeup flawless, she conveys exactly what she wants her viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have finally found her sense of self and purpose in life and who, at just 36, has finally found her place.
It's a real shame he didn't get to prove it to himself.
Typhoon is preparing to hit southern Japan
Much of southern Japan, including areas devastated by heavy rains last month, braced for even more rain on Friday as Typhoon Noru, at one point the world's strongest storm of the year, moved closer to the country's main islands.
The Meteorological Office said that the Amami Archipelago, a little south of the southern island of Kyushu and about 1,350 kilometers from Tokyo, will be hit by strong winds and heavy rainfall on Friday afternoon, with up to 800 millimeters of rain likely over the next 48 hours.
A weather service official said that Noru, which means "deer" in Korean, would then likely turn north and rain on Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit by torrential rains and floods last month that killed 36 people and left four missing, would likely escape the worst.
"It's an extremely slow-moving storm", he added, noting that the increased risk of flooding is due to the heavy rainfall in one area over a longer period.
Noru, once a Category 5 typhoon and a typically long-lived storm, first formed two weeks ago and swam in a circle across the northern Pacific before heading north, hitting Japan and weakening on its approach.
The representative added that depending on the change in course, Norway could move by elections directly over Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu, but a longer route is still difficult to determine.
There are places in the landscape that even with the best of intentions, if necessary, conventional vehicles simply cannot reach.
There's an ATV.
ATVs used in the military field, provided an overview of the Defense House!
The use of such lightweight and well-traveled vehicles in military structures is not new.
The need for them arose during World War II, but more attention was given to them a decade later.
Simplicity and power
As early as 1956, Willys rolled out of the Overland plant the M-274 - a development of the mechanical mule, a vehicle designed to evacuate the wounded in the closing years of World War II.
It's a little weird to call a mechanical mule a progression.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and wheel, all the luxury.
It was as if the overly rigid designers had too hardly laid out the plans on the engineer's desk and rushed to production.
But in war, it's more about the penetration than the comfort.
The mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam was unrivaled in this category.
The lightweight, less than a hundred pounds [500 kg], barely made it to the places where the Willys Jeep, with its mythological reputation for super-performance, was to surrender its brake lights.
Vehicles weighing up to 500 kilograms were used extensively for transportation, both ground and manpower.
In other cases, the mule was fitted with lighter, non-recoil-operated anti-tank weapons.
But when a truck like that caught fire, and it did, the driver was able to, in the last hurdle, shift the steering wheel forward and lower it so low that the vehicle could be driven on its stomach.
The mules were produced until 1970, with a total of 11,240 completed, and they were in service with the army until 1980, when they were replaced by the victorious HMMWVs.
For the next two decades, ATVs were of rather marginal importance in military circles.
They came back after the twin towers in New York City fell to the ground and U.S. troops found themselves roaming the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan.
That's where the knowledge and understanding was born that something needed to fill the gap between the Humvee and the infantry.
Since ATVs generally do not provide considerable protection, they are not necessarily the best choice for combat missions.
But fast and light machines are good for special tasks.
Even in intelligence and rescue operations.
There are thousands of ATVs and UAVs in service with the U.S. military today.
Most of them, like the XUV550s purchased for the Defense League, are essentially similar to civilian vehicles, but upgraded to suit military needs.
The camouflage brands include the Kawasaki Mule, Honda Rancher and Foreman, Yamaha Rhino and Arctic Cat, and an ever-expanding range of models from leading military ATV manufacturer Polaris.
In 2013, Polaris entered into a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Center (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract for single-seat Polaris Sportsman-based MV850s with both infrared and black-out lights and innovative bee-shaped tyres that provide mobility after a 50 caliber weapon impact.
Before the MV850 was launched, Polaris was able to supply the MV700 and MV800 to the military.
The MV700 is a military version of the Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, built for civilian use, with front and rear cranks, a two-part fuel tank for longer distances, a reinforced frame and bottom and some other military equipment that is not too much trouble for farmers or forestry workers.
Like the Polaris ATVs, the John Deere M-Gator used successfully in both Iraq and Afghanistan, it is equipped with armor support, a luggage compartment hood and some other elements useful in the wristbands but necessary in the battle zone.
A 750-pound vehicle can carry almost half its own body weight, or, more accurately, 1,800 pounds [570 kg].
The engine is also capable of carrying lighter trailers and ammunition.
A rear-mounted, adjustable box with removable sides allows for a baggage transport from point A to point B larger than the small but rather large insect.
Later versions of the M-Gator were also produced, the A1, which is 20 hp more powerful than the original M-Gator, and the subsequent A2, with a reinforced frame, which is even better for carrying and towing weights, and the A3, which combines the positive characteristics of the A1 and A2.
The M-Gators were actually delivered to the firemen in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where they were used by medical brigades to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they eased the burden of the foot soldiers, replacing them with items that would otherwise have had to be carried on a stool.
While most ATVs in force structures are modifications of civilian vehicles, there are some exceptions.
The most notable of these are the Prowler war horses, made at Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all sorts of combat, reconnaissance, and rescue missions around the world.
The manufacturer claims that the special operations vehicles first introduced 10 years ago have overcome the bottlenecks of ATVs in general use and those modified for military use in terms of both handling, durability and safety.
While similar in construction and size to a conventional ATV, the Prowler is totally different in both its construction and capability.
It is faster, more durable, more stable, and can pull and carry more weight than other vehicles of its kind.
For example, whereas a conventional ATV requires the driver to constantly play with his body position to maintain the vehicle's balance and use both hands to maneuver, accelerate and brake, driving a Prowler is more similar to driving a car.
But in the end, it doesn't matter if it's a Prowler, a Gator, an MV850, or some other ATV or UTV, the concept and application are all the same.
And it's clear that in a situation where defense spending is being cut to a large extent and a large-scale conventional war is being replaced by a smaller, targeted whistle, lightweight, fast light vehicles have joined the military to stay in service.
The Department's crackdown on vulnerable children in care led to the release of sensitive data
The concerned breach resulted in the wrong transmission of personal data of the children in care, including information on whether they were sexually active, to the mother of one child.
The mother was emailed a spreadsheet containing the names, dates of birth, and whereabouts of all the children in the care of a large provider in Victoria, as well as specific concerns and places of concern.
The e-mail revealed the whereabouts of each child.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy has been released on bail and is engaging in sexual behavior, that a 15-year-old girl with problems with self-harm, substance abuse, and runaway behavior is "out with a boyfriend" and "will not be home tonight", and that a 14-year-old boy needs help "taking care of himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The tablet appears to be a surrender document intended for the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes on when some children should be expected at home or whether they can contact staff to pick them up.
Some of the children are presented in disturbing detail.
A warning about a 15-year-old boy reads: "If staff contact you to obtain permission to search the room and/or search a laptop/USB device for suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, permission must be granted".
The document also states that a 17-year-old girl who will be 18 in just three months and be released from a foster home is at such a high risk of suicide that staff must immediately call the emergency department if she runs away.
The 16-year-old boy on parole was listed as out and "will contact the staff later to be followed".
Although the locations listed are only the name of the accommodation unit where the children are kept and not their addresses, there is still enough detail to make them available.
The 2015 data breach came out when the mother shared with Fairfax Media her experience in dealing with the Department of Health and Human Services and Child Protective Services since taking her daughter into custody four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had turned 18 and left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to put her daughter in foster care was made after a violent incident at home, one of a growing number of complaints of domestic violence from parents against their children.
For example, her daughter was able to face seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home, she was moved hundreds of miles away to a home and community where she seemed to be doing well, but then she was moved back without telling her parents, and her caregivers accepted and facilitated the relationship between her daughter and her older husband.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old with whom the welfare authorities allowed her then 15-year-old daughter to stay regularly at a local hotel, ended when the young man was accused of having sexual relations with a child a few days after he turned 18.
"Why did he leave the system worse off than when he entered?" the mother asks.
"And does this happen to all the children in your care?"
He strongly supports the creation of an agency that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor children for the first few weeks after they are placed in care before they are moved into homes.
This would enable them to better understand how children interact with others, the risks involved and their needs, especially in an educational way.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, including by trying to better support their parents.
The targeted assistance packages, funded with $62 million over four years, are designed to help move children from home care to better-organized settings.
In addition, a two-year, $5.6 million experiment, released last October, will provide professional caregivers for at least 28 children to help them get out of or avoid care.
According to a department spokesperson, the leak was not officially reported when it happened, although the mother claims she notified two department employees within months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyze the case.
"Any alleged leak of private data is taken very seriously, and we are working to ensure that it does not adversely affect the young people involved".
In July last year, Family and Children Minister Jenny Mikakos commissioned an independent review of a sample of child protection privacy incidents over a five-year period.
The Department agreed to the seven recommendations made as a result and has since updated the Child Protection Code to ensure that staff have a clear understanding of their roles and privacy practices, modified IT systems to prohibit the automatic collection of certain personal data, and formally reviewed the Department's privacy practices.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia charged with massive money laundering offences
The Australian government on Thursday indicted the nation's largest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank, on widespread violations of anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules.
The financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC announced that it had initiated civil proceedings against CommBank in federal court for a "serious and systematic misconduct" in the largest case of its kind in Australia and the first to involve a major bank.
'CommBank's conduct in this case has left Australian society vulnerable to serious and persistent financial crime,' AUSTRAC said in the court document.
Commonwealth Bank said in a statement that it would investigate the allegations further and respond "when the time is right".
Australia's largest mortgage lender failed to disclose "at the appropriate time or not at all" the suspicious circumstances "in transactions totalling more than A$77 million (US$61 million)", AUSTRAC reported.
The Agency claims that the Bank has committed 53 700 offences under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Act, in particular with regard to so-called smart ATMs.
The previous largest such case involved earlier this year Australia's most popular bookmaker Tabcorp Holdings, which had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid a fine of A$45 million, the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.
A representative of AUSTRAC declined to comment on the possible penalty for CommBank or whether other banks may be in the agency's line of fire.
The maximum penalty for breaching the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act is A$18 million per offence.
Smart cash machines are a type of ATM that accept both cash and cheque payments and facilitate anonymous cash payments.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank's smart ATMs has increased significantly since their launch in May 2012.
The Commission also noted that the cash payments amounted to AUD 5,8 billion in the six months prior to June 2016 compared to AUD 89 million in the first six months after CommBank's launch of ATMs.
AUSTRAC claims in the court documents that the cash payments were made under false names so that the proceeds went to the drug importing syndicates.
'Even after the suspicion of money laundering or 'smurfing' in CommBank accounts was brought to CommBank's attention, CommBank did not start monitoring its customers to make it harder to control money laundering and terrorist financing,' the court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank accounts were also used for 'confusion-mashing', a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without the money actually having to cross international borders.
The merger of Nordea and DNB will be a reality by the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltic into the financial group Luminor will not take place until the last quarter of this year, reports Åripäev.
The opening of the doors in the common legal body has been increasingly postponed.
Following the disclosure of the merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could be delayed until the second quarter.
However, in April, DNB's head of communications said that the matter would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority gave Luminor additional instructions for implementation in view of the regional importance of the Bank.
Trump called New Hampshire a "drug corner", angering state politicians.
"The president is wrong", said New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
It's disappointing that his misrepresentation of the epidemic ignores all the great things this state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, called the comments "disgusting" and said on Twitter that her state is no different from others struggling with widespread opioid abuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also a Democrat, agreed.
"It is completely unacceptable for the president to talk about NH in this way", he tweeted.
This is a completely false picture of NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.
Drug overdoses killed more people in 2016 than guns or car accidents - an estimated 59,000 people, according to data analyzed by The New York Times - and are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50.
In 2015, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services reported that more than 97 million people in the United States used prescription painkillers.
An estimated 12 million of these people did so in a way not prescribed by a doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard, and its residents raised the issue repeatedly with presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
In New Hampshire, an estimated 470 overdose deaths were reported in 2016, compared with 439 in 2015.
In 2012, there were 163, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in an email as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
He said the state has also spent millions of dollars on childhood prevention programs, law enforcement to end the drug trade, and initiatives to make naloxone more accessible for overdose treatment.
A challenge to find drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in Witton.
Police are trying to locate two drivers in connection with the investigation into the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
A teenager was attacked in the Witton area of Birmingham on July 26th at approximately 02:00 (BST).
Before the attack, she was raped at Witton Station.
In the first case, a man has been charged.
British Transport Police would like to speak to two drivers as part of their investigation.
Police say the first car is a light-colored sedan.
Senior Investigative Officer Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We want to know what was said during the conversation, and the director may have important details that will help us in our investigation".
The driver of the other vehicle, described as a red VW Sharan, probably drove the victim home after she was raped a second time, according to police.
The rainy season is allowed for that weekend, so it's time to get some proper exercise.
Why don't you trim your leg muscles?
You're Gorgeous shares nine exercises that should help you achieve smoother, more toned legs.
They say the first changes should be visible after the first week of training!
Even though the weekend is here, your spirit hasn't diminished.
Still busy, trying to get other people to work hard.
You could forget about your worries and go out with your sweetheart.
Take time for yourself to enjoy each other's company in some quiet, romantic place.
You're on fire talking about something exciting, making big plans, maybe even making promises... that you forget a moment later.
The other side will remember what you said.
I guess it's just being kind of restless, having a hard time focusing on something.
Your feelings may not be based on what is happening now but on what has happened in the past.
Even when faced with a difficult situation, you can act quickly and wisely.
You may be able to help someone out today because you have enough wisdom and confidence.
You'd better stop worrying about money and business.
Take time to rest and relax.
Attending a crowded event can be tiring and somewhat nervous.
You may accidentally find yourself in a situation where a serious argument erupts, requiring you to defend your position vigorously.
If the others cross the line, you don't.
You feel more comfortable in a familiar environment, doing things that you know and that bring you joy.
I guess you're not thirsty for new knowledge and adventure right now.
Having fun is an activity that you probably never really get your appetite up for.
You're gonna be dragged into the company again tonight.
But what happens at the party may not be the usual.
It may be that you still have to deal with some work-related issues even though you have the day off.
Or you're physically at home, but you're still at your desk.
If you want a sharp experience, travel can provide it.
You're caught up in the whirlwind of adventure, and you have to pull yourself together to keep up with the tide and keep your balance.
Don't waste your energy arguing about money.
Only bring up the matter if the situation really calls for quick and decisive action.
Why do dogs chew the grass?
Sometimes it's thought that a dog eats weed when he's not feeling well and wants to throw up.
In fact, most dogs that eat the herb are perfectly healthy.
Less than 10 percent of dogs that chew grass do so because of some disease.
One reason a dog may suddenly start eating grass may be a nutrient-poor diet.
Even those dogs with worms may become more interested in chewing the grass.
So if a dog who has never chewed grass has a sudden appetite for grass and eats it often, it may be worth checking with a doctor to quickly detect a possible digestive problem.
It is worth noting that a dog may also eat grass because he likes the taste or is simply bored.
If a health problem has been ruled out, it may be helpful to make sure that the family pet still receives sufficient developmental and emotional activity.
Thunder clouds coming in from the west.
In many parts of northern Estonia, rumblings and isolated flashes have already been heard.
The weather service also issued a thunderstorm warning this afternoon.
Today, there will be thunderstorms in several parts of the country, mainly in northern Estonia.
The thunder clouds are moving rapidly from west to east.
"Southeasterly winds reach up to 50 mph [15 m/s] inland, on islands and along the coast, but thunderstorms may be accompanied by stronger winds", says the weather service's website.
But a much bigger thunderstorm is blowing in southeastern Finland and Russia east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, however, the winds in Estonia are from the west and south, so there is at least no immediate risk of major storms turning on Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone is set to make a guest appearance on the second season of "Our Lives".
Executive producer Dan Fogelman announced at the Television Critics Association press conference Thursday that Sylvester Stallone will be joining the cast of NBC's popular drama for its upcoming second season.
The actor will guest star as Kevin (Justin Hartley) in the filming of the season premiere.
"Kevin's in a big movie and we needed a big co-star", Fogelman said.
At the end of last season, Kevin was cast in a major role in a film directed by Ron Howard that was a flash in the pan.
This season, we see the character participate in the project while also heating up her relationship with her ex, played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone will play "a father figure in a film starring Kevin".
"Our Lives" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in the show's past credits, coincidentally played Stallone's son in the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa".
Fogelman said that Ventimiglia's still-flourishing friendship with Stallone was probably what helped attract the big star to guest star on the show.
"We have a great script for her.
I think it's going to be really exciting", said Fogelman.
Our Lives returns to theaters on September 26th.
In the United States, two employees of elite schools were arrested in the wake of a national manhunt.
42-year-old Northwestern professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to police in California after police searched for him.
Andrew Warren, a 56-year-old Oxford University employee, was arrested by police in San Francisco.
The men are suspected of brutally stabbing 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
She was found dead in Latham's apartment in Chicago late last month.
A few days later, the suspects made a large donation to a library in cash under the name of the deceased.
Before turning himself in, Latham sent a video to friends and family, according to a Chicago police officer, about his biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police won't release it.
Police said it was a brutal murder and that his body had been transformed by the injuries.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from the U.K., but investigators have yet to determine whether or how he knew the victim.
Before the arrest, both suspects had fled the state.
Elise Christie talks about how she overcame the horrors of Sochi and cyberbullying to get back on the ice for gold.
Compared to this frail young woman who recently considered saying goodbye to the ski resort forever, 26-year-old Christie has changed beyond recognition.
He was devastated by the cruel insults, especially because he had been bullied at school in West Lothian as a child.
Now he's packing on confidence and believes the challenge can be a round trip back to square one, bringing at least one gold to Pyeongchang.
"I definitely want to be an Olympic champion", he says, not afraid to state his goal.
"I feel that I am physically and mentally in the right place to handle this".
She once dreamed of a career as a beauty queen until aesthetic considerations began to dampen her interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the artistic side of things", he said, laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, decency.
It was the right choice because the short-term is the best fit for my personality".
A woman walks around the world on foot: my daily budget is 5 dollars!
Honestly, I had a similar experience, a 40-day experience, where I decided to live the life of a "multitude" in the south of France, to just be free and live one day at a time.
Spent the night in tents, in the woods, in small town stations, etc.
The next week, I joined a French homeless man, 44 years old.
Oh, don't think of it as some kind of gay thing, we just spent the night in the same park in Mentone and became friends, even though he was 15 years older than me, he was a good friend.
Turns out the guy's from a good family, from Paris, a former French naval officer.
No drinking, no crime, in a word, decent person, intelligent, friendly, experienced in life.
In a word, I joined him and for the next three weeks we were walking together, from town to town and also about 5 euros a day for food.
The money came anyway, enough to live on.
He taught me how to help out at night on the terraces of closing hotels and restaurants and on farms that were on the way.
We worked just enough to pay for lunch for the next two or three days and then...
At some point, I got a fever and decided I couldn't take it anymore.
I took a flight to Helsinki, then home.
And by the way, I still regret it.
Those 40 days were probably the best of my life.
A man was burned alive in Indonesia for stealing three loudspeakers from a mosque, reports the Hungarian news agency MTI.
A thief, aged 30, snuck out of a mosque in Bekasi, near Jakarta, on August 1, with a loudspeaker, but the temple guard spotted him and shouted: "Arrest the thief!"
He came to help and immediately began to pursue the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few kilometers, then a stone thrown by the pursuers hit the pursuer's head, causing a serious injury.
An angry pursuer caught the thief and beat him to death.
A stalker ran over a thief with gasoline and set him on fire.
The innocent died of his burns at the scene.
The body was taken to East Jakarta Police Hospital.
Police have seized both the dead motorcycle and the stolen audio equipment.
Initial reports in the local press suggested that the thief was not a burglar but an electrician who wanted to fix the sound systems.
The police, however, rejected these claims decisively.
The coroner's office said they would not comment on the incident.
According to the German news agency dpa, the reason for this move is that Indonesians have little confidence in the police or the judiciary.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, 87.2% are Muslim.
Australian cuisine: from the finger of a finger to the backyard of a school.
Modern Australian cuisine, which is largely Aboriginal, has been influenced by finger jam and kangaroo meat.
The British roots have also had a profound effect on the local food table - for example, Vegemite, a dark brown salt beer brew that is served with butter on a stew or a crackers, is reminiscent of the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or leafy-cut meats, served with potatoes and sauce, also originated in Britain.
BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, are also of British origin, and are grilled by Australians but baked in the oven by the British.
One of the local delicacies is the Pavlova biscuit, although it is also called the New Zealand biscuit.
The dessert is also a favorite of the people: crispy Anzac cookies with coconut and oatmeal crackers and chocolate chip cookies with coconut shells.
Honey joys, or the joys of the mummy, are called honey-corn jelly balls.

This fall, Stephanie will celebrate her 77th birthday.
Her father was a civil servant and her mother, Mary, was a food lover.
Stephanie studied librarianship at university, and as is the custom for young Australians, she left to explore Europe.
While traveling in France, Stephanie's love of food only strengthened and developed.
In London, however, she met her first husband, Monty, a Jamaican, and they returned to Australia in 1964 to open a simple dining establishment, The Jamaican House, in Melbourne.
A decade later, the marriage broke up and the restaurant closed.
In 1976, she opened Stephanie's Restaurant, a restaurant for the slightly wealthier population, which was one of Melbourne's most highly regarded restaurants for the next 21 years.
The landmark restaurant is still described as the first fine dining establishment in Melbourne that truly appreciated fresh ingredients and offered seasonal food - a fact that may seem far-fetched today but was not so at the end of the last century.
Since retiring from the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, 15 of which have been published since her marriage.
There are more productive food writers in Estonia, but for her, not a single book was just a recipe book.
For home cooks in Australia, Stephanie Alexander's cookbooks have been invaluable.
But she considers her life's work a fifth cookbook, the superb "The Cook's Companion", now in at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was first published in 1996, with an updated edition in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
This 2004 edition takes up quite a bit of space in my bookshelf, for the imposing book contains some 1,000 recipes on 1,126 pages!
The newest variant is even more capable.

It is a veritable cookbook, offering recipes, buying and storage of ingredients, cooking techniques, and kitchen appliance recommendations.
The food is in alphabetical order, and there are many cross-references - clearly not a literacy education for the food writer.
Stephanie herself points out that it was this book that changed her life and gave her a new direction in her future activities.
The feeling that the book had something to offer people, which was born out of its popularity, led to the next big project, kitchen gardens, which are comparable to school gardens in our circumstances.
The fourth Estonian person in Finland had a heart attack.
Doctors at the Northern Estonia Regional Hospital (PERH), including heart surgeon Günter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põra, who participated in the operation with Finnish paramedics, said that the postoperative period was as expected.
"It is very difficult to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart", said Duck.
Doctors have confirmed that the world's maximum life expectancy at a heart pump is now eight years.
The man is still recovering and not ready to talk about it.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease was already in its final stages, with heart failure leading to ischaemia.
"For this patient, transplantation was the only option", added Taal.
The heart surgeon says that after the transplant, the patient no longer has the batteries or wires that came with the heart pump.
All he'll have left is a scar and immunosuppressant medication.
The patient can exercise and generally live like a normal person", he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
The duck added that it would take three to six months to make a full recovery.
Both doctors say that the patient must be strictly monitored on regular medication; yet, medications have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to avoid a donor organ rejection reaction.
The first year is the most dangerous, but according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients survive more than ten years.
Taal said that in Helsinki, the results are better and the longest lived transplanted heart is 25 years.
The heart surgeon explained that because of the disease, the patient had poor circulation and had received a heart pump a year ago to help him recover from surgery.
When the man's pulmonary arterial pressure dropped, he became a suitable candidate for a transplant.
According to Thales, the transplant operation is not considered a very difficult operation: timing is very important.
"It took a lot longer to get the pump and then get the heart than it did to put a new heart in", he said.
In addition, the heart surgeon brought out the extracorporeal blood flow as a complicated part of the surgery.
Rather, he says, heart transplants are rare because Estonians need them the least.
Kidney, liver, and lung transplants are increasing.
It's not unusual to have a very exciting harvest, but we've been practicing this for many years.
Learning to know yourself and your nervous system is an art at this office", added Taal.
We need four more people for the organ.
According to Thail, the patient received a heart because no other patients in the Scandiatransplant Community country had a suitable organ.
Scandiatransplant is an organ transplant organisation with members in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are four more people on the list of heart transplants in Estonia.
"These are still counted patients", emphasized the Duck.
Tal says the longest wait is for large men with a heart type O-positive.
"It's been about six months in Finland", he said.
There are conditions to a heart.
"Usually a woman's heart is not for a man, a big man's heart for a small man, and so on", the cardiac surgeon listed.
How do you finance the company's vehicles?
In a changing consumer society, the possibilities for corporate vehicle financing have expanded, with more and more companies using full-service or more discounted long-term car leasing in addition to conventional leasing.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the amount of aid to be recovered from the beneficiary.
According to Villi Tõldi, Sales and Marketing Manager of the international car rental company AVIS Estonia, it is clear that companies are increasingly moving towards full-service leasing and also increasingly using the option of long-term leasing.
The translator highlighted the main questions that can be answered in choosing the appropriate mode of use.
How long will the vehicle be used?
The biggest difference between renting and leasing a car is the time it takes to run it.
'Leasing is preferable for the long-term use of the vehicle if the company plans to operate commercial vehicles for a longer period,' explained Tõld, adding that it is in favour of a conventional lease to decide whether to own the vehicle, full service leasing or long-term lease if the vehicle is to be used as a service, i.e. to use the car on a daily basis, but leaving the maintenance obligations to the service provider and relinquishing the so-called ownership.
'The rental car has a much shorter period of use than the lease, but many larger car rental companies also offer long-term car rental, where car rental is done without complicated contracts and free of charge,' Tõld explained.
Who gets to own the car?
At the end of the regular lease, the tenant becomes the owner of the car.
'In the case of a service lease, at the end of the lease period, it is possible to continue the lease on the same or better terms, with the equivalent new vehicle being replaced, which meets the needs of the company,' he said, stressing that as the consumer society moves increasingly towards service-centred consumption, the ownership of a vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, full-service leasing also allows the possibility of buying a car on a voluntary basis and on agreed terms.
However, this is not possible for rental and only for the period of use.
Car leasing is usually carried out in car companies' offices and car rental is carried out at rental offices.
Although the car dealerships are primarily engaged in the sale of vehicles, they also offer the possibility of leasing and in some cases renting.
Rental companies, on the other hand, have cars for the sole purpose of renting them out.
The reason for using the rental service, explained the driver, is different - many companies rent official vehicles, and it is convenient to use it when on a business trip, on holiday or when your car is being repaired.
'For business vehicles, there is an increasing shift towards full-service leasing, which offers the customer transparency of costs, time savings in the purchase, use and return process of vehicles and greater convenience,' explained the Sales and Marketing Manager of the growing leasing trend.
Every year, more and more companies use full-service leasing for their fleet, thereby optimising their costs and focusing on their core business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
If the leased car is covered by compulsory helmet and traffic insurance, the rental car is usually covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to add, for example, accident, theft or full insurance. "But if you compare the regular lease with the full service lease, the customer gets more for the equivalent heat charge, because in addition to the rides and insurance, the heat charge also covers the proper maintenance of the cars, the daily assistance, tyre changes and other agreed services", explained Tõld.
'If any new vehicle can be taken into normal leasing, then in the case of full-service leasing the service provider helps to select a vehicle that meets the company's wishes and needs, taking into account the operating functions,' he compared, stressing that full-service leasing certainly helps to optimise the costs associated with the company's fleet.
'However, the choice of vehicles depends on the service provider's fleet of vehicles - different rental companies offer a small and economical vehicle for urban traffic as well as a luxury sedan for business meetings in their fleet,' explained Tõld.
During busy rental periods, it is possible that the desired car is already rented, but early booking of the desired vehicle helps to counteract this.
When choosing between leasing or renting, you should first make clear your goals - how long you want to use the vehicle and what your long-term plans are for the car.
It is certainly worthwhile to read carefully the terms and conditions of the various services.
At yesterday's press conference, Olga Ivanova, a member of the State Council affiliated with the Edgar Savisaare electoral alliance, said that the Savisaare electoral alliance offers the Centre Party a strong competition in the autumn elections in Tallinn.
But how likely does Edgar Savisaar think that Urmas will cooperate with the electoral association "Tegus Tallinn"?
A veteran of the United States Navy was ordered to remove the American flag from the mailbox in an envelope
The centerpiece of a bitter dispute between the United States Veterans and the Florida Homeowners Association is a mailbox covered in the American flag.
Retired United States Navy officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Southwood Housing Association in Tallahassee asking him to remove the envelope of the national flag from the mailbox or face punishment.
He told WCTV he wasn't going to give up without a fight and he's appealed.
"I honestly take it as harassment", Ackert said.
And I think people should fight all forms of bullying, especially this one.
Ackert said the homeowners' union claims his mailbox is not in keeping with Southwood's aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said that he was ordered to remove the American flag envelope covering his mailbox.
"As the holiday season draws to a close, we ask that you remove the American flag from the envelope of the mailbox", the letter said.
The cosmetics may be out for 30 days before and must be removed within 15 days afterwards.
He said the envelope's been out for four years.
It was put there 30 days after moving in.
Messages to the Southwood Community Association were not immediately responded to Thursday morning.
A few of Acker's neighbors told WCTV that the letter was a little harsh and they weren't particularly surprised by the homeowners union's actions.
"They do this kind of thing all the time", said Mike Stephenson.
I think that's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your own country?
Mike Patel said, "This is a veteran who served our country.
It's just a flag post box.
I don't think that's right.
He owns the house, at least he can afford it.
The homeowners union letter says Acker has 15 days to remove the wrapper or face a fine.
He hasn't received a response to his appeal.
Vietnam "regrets" German allegations of kidnapping
Vietnam said on Thursday it regretted comments by the German Foreign Ministry accusing Vietnamese intelligence of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil company wanted at home on embezzlement charges.
German authorities believe Trinh Xuan Thanh was captured in Berlin, which gave Vietnamese intelligence officials 48 hours to leave the country on Wednesday.
Thanh faces possession charges, which carry the death penalty if convicted.
He applied for asylum in Germany, but his application was still pending when the Vietnamese authorities demanded his extradition.
Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, told reporters that the comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31.
"Vietnam always considers and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany", he said without elaborating.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after being initially charged with dishonest management of a subsidiary of state oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, which caused about US$150 million in damages.
The Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, police launched an investigation into the takeover in connection with his alleged involvement in a real estate development.
Thanh was Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior government positions, including Deputy Governor of Hau Giang Province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was removed from the legislative body by the Communist majority before its first session the following month.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
Vietnam's ambassador to Germany was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and told that Germany was demanding Thanh's return so that asylum and extradition procedures could be properly carried out.
A bus driver rescued eight puppies from the side of the road, unaware that the dogs actually had a real owner.
"Where do I put these eight puppies, my wife would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs", joked Oleg, a bus driver who rescued the puppies from the driveway by handing them over to a shelter worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the shelter showed up, wondering why the puppies had been taken from his home.
Oleg, a bus driver in Harz, said that he had been working as a bus driver since the early 1990's, but that this had never happened before in his career".
Near the Cross of Habit, I noticed something small running along the road.
I thought it was a cake, but it turned out to be four puppies", recalled the bus driver.
Oleg got so mad, he stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"It was a shame, they were going to be run over by cars and run over by dogs", Oleg said.
He added that the passengers were reasonable and that the gentle puppies also brought them great joy.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they got funny.
Puppies on board, the bus driver went on another round because the timetable needed to be adhered to.
Once again, while driving past the puppy scene, she saw four other small dogs.
It was a German Shepherd puppy.
They were so prompt and you could tell right away that they were being taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, they were amazing.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason", the bus driver said, explaining that this was why he decided to take the puppies on the bus.
"I also took these four puppies and called the police", recalled Oleg.
Law enforcement contacted the Tallinn Animal Shelter, whose employee came to the Baltic station to pick up the puppies.
But wasn't the bus driver tempted to take the fur ball?
That was the idea.
There was a dog boy who was so beautiful and calm.
"He sat like a big dog", said Oleg.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
My wife would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs.
We have a little baby too.
It's too early to get a dog", he added.
Eve Tobias, director of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, confirmed that eight German Shepherd puppies, aged two and a half months, were indeed brought to the shelter.
But that very day, the owner came for the puppies.
"We didn't even shape these puppies and just gave them back", he noted.
"The dog owner was not very upset, but he did say that they had the only house within sight and that the bus driver could have come and asked if the puppies belonged to them", Tobias said.
The shelter manager added that fortunately, the bus driver picked up the children and did not cause an accident.
In fact, it was very kind of the bus driver to respond!
A Jordanian court has imposed a life sentence for the murder of three U.S. servicemen.
A Jordanian military appeals court sentenced a Jordanian soldier to life in prison for the shooting of three U.S. military cadets last year.
A military tribunal last month sentenced Sergeant Major Marik al-Tuwayha to life in prison with hard labor for killing Americans at the entrance to a southern Jordanian air base.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming he was afraid of an attack on the base.
But security video released after the verdict showed that he continued shooting even as two Americans hid and waved their hands to stop the shooting.
Hala Akhbar, a news website affiliated with the Jordanian military, reported on Thursday that a five-judge military appeals court upheld al-Tuwayha's sentence.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in shape.
Every NFL player depends on his body for a living.
That is why many other athletes also invest heavily in body care and rehabilitation to stay in top shape.
Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com took a closer look at how far some veterans are willing to go to extend their careers.
But no case is as extreme as that of 39-year-old James Harrison, a defensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who is entering his 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends an average of $300,000 a year on acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic and cups.
Most of the expenses are related to traveling across the country to meet with specialists.
"I don't have to keep score on these things", Harrison said.
"Compared to my expenses, the expenses are worth it, considering how I feel".
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and Steelers teammate, estimated his annual body care cost at $200,000.
Mitchell, 30, has experimented with body tempering, which Fowler described as "using a 180-pound [55 kg] metal massage roll".
"Instead of rolling on it from the sky, it rolls on you", Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot in your leg and they start moving it around, it hurts sometimes.
But when you get up, the tension is gone.
It just kicks the tension out".
They're willing to do extra work, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons for the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he didn't spend more.
"If I could go back, I would invest even more", Cofield told Fowler.
"I'd probably spend at least twice as much.
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career.
In the end, perhaps more procedures would have helped".
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old defensive back, expressed his willingness to follow in the footsteps of his veteran Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and make an additional $3 million playing, the decision is pretty simple", Shazier said.
As far as career longevity goes, investing in player recovery is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play past the age of 30, the more so should Harrison's success convince his colleagues to redirect their spending elsewhere.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells Evening Standard that the festival was originally founded years ago in Finland and its owners went to see the beach side of Riga to expand, but on the way back they stopped in Pärnu and so the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says they have set a goal of 25,000 visitors a day, but the pigeons will not be counted until after the festival.
The preparations for this year's party started back in September.
"We had information from the city that the previous site was going to be built, and that a hotel was going to be built there", says Gunnar, who has been facing a change this year.
I don't see any bumps on it right now, but the assumption is that if the bump didn't go in this year, it will next.
So maybe we should have moved out sometime", he explains why the festival area has moved this year.
They're doing a year-round festival.
There are between a thousand and a half thousand people working on the weekend - police officers, management team, volunteers, shopkeepers, security team and so on.
The hardest thing for Viese was getting The Chainsmokers to perform.
Men are the undisputed number one in pop music right now.
Why The Chainsmokers were hard to get to the weekend and how Gunnar comments on the two artists' cancellations, watch the video.
In reply to Ansip, Ratas said: we have done a lot for the success of Estonia.
In an interview with the Kronika, Vice-President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip said he was sad to see the daily politics of Estonia as the government of Jüri Ratas has turned a simple and predictable tax system upside down.
You used the opportunity to ask me in the magazine Kronika what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am pleased that we have been a good team in the government and have made many important decisions in the last few months, many of which have been awaited in Estonia for over ten years", Ratas wrote today on social media.
According to Ratase, these decisions include, for example, income tax reform to increase people's incomes, pension reform to ensure a dignified retirement age for the elderly, local government reform to balance Estonia's development, increase in agricultural subsidies to revive rural life and, of course, health care reform to provide affordable and quality medical care.
"I wish you a good rest!" wrote Ratas, addressing Ansip.
Talent on the weekend: drunk man gets into a stranger's car and falls asleep.
Last night at 3:00 a.m., the officers received a rather self-serving challenge.
An Audi owner reported that a stranger had fallen asleep in his car at a gas station outside Port Arthur.
A patrol responding to the incident found a man in the back who was startled when law enforcement arrived.
A man had been on a journey, and he had been tired for a moment and had found a seat in the back seat of a stranger's car.
"The man was awakened by the police and started walking home on his own", the Western Prefecture said on Facebook.
It's all right, it's all right!
A good open-air cinema is not necessary to look far - from 7 to 12 August, the film festival tARTuFF will be held in the centre of Tartu, directly on the town hall square.
What makes it special is its focus on romance movies.
The program also includes films that depict the darker side of love, including new linen works as well as good old classics.
Numerous special events in many locations turn campus into a movie town for a week.
All films are free to visitors, seating up to 1,500 and this year there will be a mural-covered area directly in front of the screen, creating a temporary park atmosphere in the city's central square.
The largest open-air theater in Europe, Switzerland, can accommodate 8,000 people at a time.
From 2 to 12 August, the heart of the Locarno Film Festival will be the Piazza Grande, or Grand Square.
The festival features many premieres by renowned directors and actors.
At dusk, a ticket of 15 to 20 euros is required to see a movie.
Pula Film Festival in a Roman amphitheater, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowds, muddy arena - this is the image that opened 2,000 years ago in the Pula amphitheater in Croatia, where international audiences now enjoy movies on a summer night in July.
The first outdoor screen was installed in the Roman-era building in 1953, making the Pula Film Festival one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Under the stars, good films have been enjoyed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: an evening in the Mediterranean with quality films costs about three euros.
Secret open-air cinema in Montjuïc, Spain
Besides the film, the Sala Montjuïc open-air cinema offers a wonderful view.
It is located high above Barcelona, on Montjuïc, the Jewish hill.
In the darkness of the southern European evening, the whole of Barcelona's fireslide, a sight in its own right, rises from the moat of the hilltop fortress.
The organizers will erect a moat to house a large screen that will show famous films from La La Land to 1979's Manhattan.
The cinema can accommodate up to 2500 people at a time and the entrance fee is 6.50 euros.
The ticket price also includes an outdoor concert just before the film, which is allowed to be enjoyed next to your picnic basket.
If you do not want to sit on the grass or have forgotten your picnic table, you can borrow a deckchair for three euros.
Under the stars of cinema, Italy
A true nostalgic Italian spirit can be experienced in Bologna's central square, where on summer evenings, the restored pearls of the local film archive are shown.
Besides the tenth largest church in the world, the Basilica of San Petronio, it can hold 3,000 to 5,000 people to watch old movies.
The buildings of Northern Italy, mainly from the 15th century, combine with the warmth of a summer evening and the good company of a romantic atmosphere that blends every northern flair.
From June 19 to August 15, a new film will be shown every night, all free of charge.
The Bologna Film Archive Festival "Cinema under the stars" is a film festival.
Film festival in the city hall square of Vienna, Austria
Vienna is a mecca for the music world, and even for the films: the Vienna Rathausplatz Film Festival, which takes place in the city hall square of the Austrian capital, exclusively features concert recordings and music films.
5,000 free seats fill up like magic every night from June 30th to September 3rd.
In addition to concerts by classical music stars - Placido Domingo and the Vienna Philharmonic - the festival features jazz recordings in the morning.
What makes filmmaking in Vienna special is its love of good food - world-class music and fine dining.
Every day from 11 a.m. to midnight, the food and beverage area offers traditional Austrian dishes, as well as Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and Indian delicacies.
The stupidest questions you could ask a bartender.
The Huffington Post is running questions that barmen have heard that they'd rather not hear.
What's your best drink?
True, some drinks have more ingredients than others, but they require the same skill and skill to be made.
Often, bartenders interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest thing you have to make right now?" to signal to them that the customer doesn't care what he drinks, whether or not it makes it difficult for the bartender.
What's your favorite drink to make?
This question is interpreted in the same way as which cocktail would be easiest to get from the bartender at the moment.
It's not the bartender's job to say. It's the customer's decision based on the thickness of their wallet.
I'd rather wait for the bartender to ask if there's any specials right now.
What good is there?
Perhaps the question is a sincere desire to know if the bar is different in some way, but there is another way to ask.
And the bartender can't even predict what the customer might prefer.
Can I get a drink that's not too sweet?
Here, as in the previous case, the bartender is not aware of your tastes and preferences, and what is sweet to one may not be to another.
But he's willing to listen to what flavours the desired cocktail might contain.
Does this drink give me a headache/dizziness?
A bartender isn't a medicine man or a fortune teller to tell a customer that, hand on heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad to such an extent that package tours are not only expensive but sold out regardless of price.
Also, it would be wise to think about travel plans for the coming year rather than relying on cheap airline tickets and last-minute tickets.
A man took a model hostage with a plan to sell her on the dark web.
A Polish national took a British model hostage in Italy.
The man was planning to auction off a 20-year-old woman on the dark web, an encrypted Internet, the Guardian reported.
According to the police, the woman was lured to Milan on July 11th with the promise of a job in a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
Allegedly, her captors tried to sell her on the dark web for £230,000 and demanded a ransom from her modeling agency.
However, on July 17, her captor took her to the British consulate.
Police have confirmed the suspect is a Polish national, Lukasz Herba, who lives in the UK.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a small child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
People are fascinated by experiments like this.
It would be nice if we could just go ahead and think about it and draw some conclusions.
The suggestion to spend a little more time researching the background of those who want to be friends is obvious.
But more generally, everyone should have a strategy for what they share on social media.
But at the national level, the question is whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers posed by social media.
The life of the leeches, raised in controlled conditions, ended with the summer school, but certainly not that of the native bats.
You have to go to the woods every once in a while, for whatever reason.
But if the cold gets in the way, it's time to make a hot cup of tea.
There are enough resources in the forest.
Home Guard! is giving a little tour.
We call it tea because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which, while mildly stimulating, is not the best for our health.
Using wild plants always requires being prepared to experiment, as recipes and flavors vary.
Some plants need only a little boiling time, with just a little hot water, while others need to be left to simmer for hours.
Of course, care must also be taken to ensure that the water and plants are sufficiently clean.
Much also depends on the season and place of harvest.
Let us now consider some simple teas and their effects on us.
The Manchu road
The monk's tea can be drunk in peace all year round.
If drinking two quarts [2.0 L] of water a day is good, this tea is a good way to meet your vitamin C needs and also provide some extra energy.
As with all plants, it is possible to extract useful elements from pine trees by using alternative methods, such as crushing - the stems do not need to be boiled for long, they need only be poured with hot water and left to steep for a few hours.
For half a liter of water, you need 0.4 liters of reeds, which must be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing nearly 25 milligrams of vitamin C, high in potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 cubic parts of sugar, or about 20 kcal of sugar.
Lemon and honey can always be added to the peppermint tea to enhance its taste.
And if the drink gets ugly, you can dilute it with water like syrup.
The process of making a six-pack tea is the same, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
The peanut drink is great and helps with a lot of things, from arthritis to vertigo.
It helps to relieve fatigue, is pain-relieving, and helps with colds by relieving coughs and fevers.
As a result, it would not be worth drinking more than a pint a day.
The fruit also makes you sweat, so in winter, find a quieter time to enjoy it.
In winter, use fresh watermelon, and in summer, use leaves, buds, or berries.
A small bunch of the right length of branches is needed to make a pint of the drink, and the water is boiled until it turns red.
You can also use rose quartets as a pull.
To do this, break the stems and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
The longer and more thorough processing also makes the drink harder.
The finished pineapple drink can also be added to pineapple tea to add flavor.
The black-headed pea
A blackberry is a tree trunk that in nature looks like a burnt piece of blackberries on a tree.
It's mostly found in the boxes, but it's also found elsewhere.
The mushroom has a wide range of uses - as a hot drink, as a fire, as a substitute for a fungus, and so on.
You can wash yourself very well with ash.
Black pepper tea is a kind of super drink that can be used to treat or relieve a wide range of diseases, even cancer, to improve mood, reduce stress, prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and a high amount of B vitamins, as well as antioxidants and a little bit of minerals and protein.
Tea made from mushrooms can be drunk daily, without the risk of overconsumption.
To make the drink, a piece of mushroom measuring about 3 x 3 cm is sufficient and boiled in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited the fourth largest island in Estonia, Vorms, today as part of a small island tour, where he met with local leaders and residents to discuss current issues in island life.
The tour of Vorms Island started at the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Ratas was greeted by Tanel Viks, the mayor of Vorms, and Ivo Sarapuu, the mayor of the city.
The first thing we visited was the historic St. Olaf's Church and the adjoining cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its ring crosses made of sandstone and limestone.
The visit to the Vorms Primary School was followed by a discussion with the Headmaster, Age Hälvin, about the school's life and the curriculum, according to which some of the pupils are in distance learning.
At lunch the Prime Minister inaugurated the new and modern common building of the Operational Service in 2015, where he also met with the islanders.
The discussion focused on issues of importance to the inhabitants, such as the development of shipping and air links between the islets and the mainland.
The State has undertaken to ensure regular transport links on small permanently inhabited islands, but for example, increased traffic during the summer season also makes important trips by local residents more difficult.
These are places where the country can take local wishes and needs into account early on and in the planning process", the Prime Minister said.
The island's small-ship harbour, leisure education, safety and salvage capability were also discussed.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of the Prime Minister's tour of the small islands to get an overview of the island's living environment and to discuss issues with local residents and local government leaders.
In July, the Prime Minister visited the Ratas Islands, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi Island and Manila, and during August he visited Naissaart, Prangli and Aegna.
For the first time, the Centre Party is running without a party founder and ideological cornerstone.
So far we've said the Centre Party and we've been thinking Savisaard or vice versa.
Now the Central Command has to find a way without him.
They must also balance the party's colourful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, Savisaare's party supporters and the expectations of the electorate.
Saviare's departure puts the Centre Party in the most difficult of ideological situations.
Based on political practice and ideology, the old rhino is playing them for sure.
A number of cards that used to be trump cards may not be real this time.
The populism card doesn't work for the Centre Party because Savisaar can always promise more than the Prime Minister's party.
The Russian card is complicated by the position of the Centre Party in government and the fact that we are seeing the so-called Savinova electoral alliance pushing the gas down.
The victim's card is already in Savisaare's pocket because of the ongoing trial.
The map of the People's Party and the poor and the untouchables is also lost to the centrist party.
The first is that it is of little value without a creator, and the second is that it is more powerful and is prevented from playing by coalition partners in government.
But one card can be even more important.
All the recent elections have confirmed that the successful parties are those that can formulate the basic conflict of the election and then implement it.
Often the main conflict has been around Savisaire.
If any political party should think of breathing life into a well-functioning opposition, the Centre Party is missing another trump card.
What about the centrist party?
They still have a strong party apparatus and a significant resource.
There's a lot of bird-cutters coming in before the election.
The self-promotion that was shamed four years ago with taxpayers' money has now hopefully been paid back to the Tallinners.
Tallinn's urban media still exists, but the cultivation of partisan guerrilla literature has declined.
Besides, the party has voting magnets.
Their role this time is to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, because the representation of the ruling party is not enough to motivate voters.
Ideologically, the Yuri Wheel must find its way, because the journey to the clay island ended this week.
Three U.S. Marines are missing in a plane crash in Australian waters.
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have ended the search operation, Marine Corps Base Camp Butler in Japan said in a statement, essentially confirming that the military has no hope of finding the missing alive.
The crash was an Osprey MV-22 of the United States Navy, which took off from the USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom were found and rescued.
The plane that crashed into the sea last month was part of a joint US-Australian exercise in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said Saturday's incident took place near the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
A woman found a wedding ring in a washing machine. Who could it be?
"I was taking the laundry out of the washing machine when the glow of the washing machine rubbed my eye between the tires", says a woman who found a stranger's wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not notice the flash of light at the washing machine door at first.
I've restarted the machine.
"The two little children next to me make this dirty laundry", the woman murmurs.
When I finished my second wash and started to take out the laundry, I still had this glow between the washer's rubber bands rubbing my eye, and I found this ring there.
The gold wedding ring bears the name of a man who was married 14 years ago - Tom.
Since anyone in the family of a man or woman by that name who might be married to any Tom doesn't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin asked the older child if she had found the ring in her backyard, put it in her pocket, and then put it in the washing machine.
Karin has lived with her partner for a year in an apartment on Madala Street in Tallinn.
They used to rent it out, and that's when the washing machine came along.
But if the ring is somehow connected to the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm so tired I can't figure out which way the ring landed in the washing machine", the woman laughs.
Since the pace of life is fast enough with two small children, the find was initially forgotten on the closet at home.
"Recently, there have been posts looking for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed like the last time to look for the owner of your found ring", Karin points to a case that circulated on social media where a wedding ring found on Puhangu Street in Tallinn last week was found by a lucky owner.
"Because Facebook is a place for searching and searching, the first thing I thought of was to try my luck there", says Karin, whose post has been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"The post has received all kinds of feedback and not all is good", sighs the wife, noting that her first comments were meant to encourage her to include her husband.
I felt like I needed this shit right now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheat you've ever heard of.
To be honest, I was worried at first, but then when I heard comments that I might have been having an affair with the ring owner, I started laughing.
Commentators also suggested that the ring may have found its way into the woman's other round of clothes.
"Well, the last time I bought a pair of pants for work was six months ago, and they went into the washing machine without any further investigation, but did they?" the woman thinks.
But my partner and I agreed that now, for the sake of principle, we must find the ring owner.
Whatever the reason for the ring's disappearance.
Divorce, family dispute, whatever.
I think it's the only thing that's right, because if I ever lost my wedding ring, I know I'd be very grateful if someone tried to find me and return my valuable property.
Karin has also contacted the Family Law Office for help in finding the owner.
But I was told that no man with that name had ever married in Estonia on that date.
One ring has found its owner.
Recently, a wedding ring found in Tallinn's Pelgurann on July 21 was returned to its owner, and the engraving suggested that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I was walking the dogs this morning and noticed behind the 53rd House of the Pumpkin, in a paved path, a gold ring", says Gerli, suggesting that the engraving was that of an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (pictured) on his Facebook page and in the group "Tallinn marked", sharing the information with the North Tallinn district and North Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerl and said that the ring bearer had been identified.
"I was contacted by the owner's daughter and on Monday evening the ring was found in her possession". The ring was missing because the old lady had injured her hand and put the ring on her other finger, but it had slipped off.
"She lost it that morning while I was walking my dog", says Gerli.
Although the media's attention has been mainly focused on Pärnu and the Weekend there, this is not the only music festival this weekend.
The Innsbruck Festival in the Land of the Dead also has loyal fans.
For example, one of them tweeted: "I sold my weekend ticket so I can go to the Innsbruck".
And why not?
In addition to local artists, performers from the United States, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England, and elsewhere will also appear.
The festival in the magical forest is a charming location that surprises the performers.
One of them, Lucy Rose, didn't get a chance to tweet early this morning to say how beautiful Estonia is.
But the visitors have also been good at sharing the good.
To experience the magic of the Innsbruck Festival, check out the galleries!
Estonia U18 team in the semi-final recognized the superiority of Great Britain and will not qualify for the A-division
The match started extremely fast and there were a lot of goals in the first quarter, which the British won by five points (18:23).
In the second quarter, the gap widened even further and the visitors took a nine-point lead (31:40) at halftime.
Estonia managed to win the third quarter, but only by one point.
The Estonians' loss before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, Estonia's game completely collapsed and in the end, the loss was accepted with a score of 61:75.
The loss shattered the Estonians' hopes of reaching the A-division, where only the top two teams will get in.
In the third place match tomorrow, Estonia will face the loser of the match between Croatia and Israel.

The Australian Legs Stand at a Crossroads
Professional sport is at a crossroads in Australia: some sectors have travelled so far along the corporate road that they are too business-centric to be classified as sport;
Others return to the amateur world, too sport-centric to be considered a business.
This confusion is illustrated by cricket Australia's (CA) painful delays in reaching a salary agreement with players, the Australian Rugby Union's (ARU) indecision in dismissing the team, the FFA's (FFA) stakeholder uprising, the difficulties with the formation of an independent commission to function rugby and the Australian Football League's (AFL) relentless efforts to be the nation's flag bearer for social justice.
Investment banker and Australian Sports Commissioner John Wylie has sought to actively lead Olympic sports along the same path as the professional leagues, placing businessmen with no elite experience in the sport in senior positions.
Mining giant Rio Tinto, with a reputation for using tactics to suppress unions, was seen as a pillar in CA's problems in reaching a deal with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA).
CA Chairman David Peever is a former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia and he hired a Rio Tinto executive and advisor to help CA negotiate salary.
But it would be a mistake to think that elite businessmen, who are ruthless in their dealings with cricketers, do not enjoy the sport.
Peever, for example, was a regular at Storm home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, tough negotiations between the CA and the ACA and extremely high wages have left the impression that Australia's summer favourite is now more business than sport.
On the contrary, the inability of the ARU's incompetent leader, former NAB CEO Cameron Clyne, to pick out the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed it back too far to its roots.
Rugby fans now prefer to huddle in a suburban stadium to watch an amateur game while sipping beer and eating hot dogs.
Rugby boasts that it has the most qualified and versatile corporate board in Australia, but the overwhelming failure to meet the demands of international partners shows that it is still too much sport to be a business.
Both rugby and football have management problems as stakeholders demand more power.
Both league chairmen, John Grant of the ARLC and Steven Lowy of the FFA, have shown that their business acumen has not been sufficient to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, a former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company, but was completely out of the game for 20 years.
This became valuable when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
The overwhelmingly distrustful stakeholders decided that no one who had played rugby league in any capacity in the last three years could participate in the Commission's work, except as a passive fan.
But the pendulum moved too far into the commercial side, and fans have been looking for a savior ever since - someone with a distinguished history in the sport.
Lowy, the CEO of Westfield Foreign Investment, inherited the FFA chairman's role from his father Frank, one of Australia's richest men.
The A-League clubs want to be better represented in the Congress that elects the board.
Their owners are losing money, but they believe they're as worthy as Manchester United.
Ironically, the sports and business ethics council of FIFA is sending out ambassadors to end the civil war in sports.
The AFL has its own ties to Rio Tinto through recently retired chairman Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL commissioner Chris Lynch, the mining giant's chief financial officer.
The League prides itself on its national leadership role in promoting gender equality, activities for indigenous and refugee communities and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done by hiding government subsidies.
AFL president Richard Goyder said upon taking over from Fitzpatrick, "The AFL is more than a business, considering how it helps all these communities".
Goyder is the soon-to-be-retired CEO of Wesfarmers and the first AFL president not to play the game at the elite level.
Former West Farmers chairman Bob Every is on the board of Cricket Australia.
The appointment of board members in professional sports is often characterised by a preference for autonomy over competence.
In their rush to recruit businessmen, they've forgotten something that could be called a passion and affection for sports.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not used to the media-intensive and sometimes personal-level critical monitoring.
Anything that works in the corporate world may not work in sports.
Flynn submitted a revised disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser, on Thursday released a revised federal financial disclosure report that includes new details about Flynn's contracts with Trump's transition to the presidency, a company linked to the Iranian-American businessman, and the parent company of the data company that worked for the Trump campaign.
In a letter that sent corrected information, Flynn noted that his initial disclosure reports were made in a hurry without the usual consultation and review provided by White House counsel and the government's Office of Ethics.
According to the letter, Flynn didn't get the attention that was given to the others because he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn resigned just 24 days into his term amid rumors that he had given Vice President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties to the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn has also been criticized for external payments made to him while working in the private sector after resigning as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In a previous statement to House investigators, Flynn stated that he received fees and charges of approximately $68,000 from entities associated with Russia in 2015.
In addition to the Russian-related income, information released Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least $5,000 for consulting on a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project had been made public before, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to work with SCL Group, at the time the UK parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a data science firm hired by the Donald Trump campaign.
One of Cambridge's main funders is venture capital magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a powerful Conservative financial supporter.
The Washington Post reported in February that Flynn was hired as a consultant to the SCL Group.
According to those familiar with his role, Flynn's aim was to help SCL's American subsidiary win new public contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired a former colleague of Flynn, a former head of national intelligence, to lead its procurement efforts.
According to a person familiar with Flynn's activities, he did not receive any compensation from SCL and did not perform any actual work.
New information has emerged that Flynn received approximately $28,000 in connection with Trump's inauguration.
The largest publicly disclosed source of income is $140,000 from Flynn's work as an advisor and consultant for Minneapolis-based NJK Holding Corp., a company run by Nasser Kazeminy, an Iranian-born businessman now living in the United States.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday evening that NJK's statement said that Flynn "advised NJK Holdings on its interest in investing in securities".
NJK is funding a technology company called GreenZone Systems, run by Flynn as vice president.
GreenZone is run by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner at Intel, a company currently under investigation for its role in lobbying on behalf of a Dutch company linked to the Turkish government.
Earlier Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travel.
During Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
But according to Cummings, Flynn didn't tell the same investigators about any of those contacts.
According to the person with knowledge of the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed security at the time.
The lead singer was revived on stage in August blues, the singer was taken by ambulance to Tallinn
Ivan was playing the whole set when he got hit by a pitch.
An ambulance was called in and massaged his heart for several minutes", says organiser Indrek Ditmann to Elu24.
"The plan was delayed, but the festival will go ahead", he says, adding: "The audience has been informed, of course they saw everything that happened on stage".
At the moment, Ivan is on his way to Tallinn in an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course, we hope for the best", Ditmann concludes.
A witness told Western Life that a health worker hit Denisenko during a performance.
First the man stopped singing, then the ball game started and the man fell on the stage.
Jan Uuspöld, a speaker, came on stage and asked if there was a doctor in the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
♪ I'm not going to let you go ♪
Ivan Denisenko, also known as Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivan's musical career began in parallel with his art studies at the National Academy of Arts and Architecture of Ukraine.
At the university, his incredibly deep bass was immediately admired and he was invited to sing in the nationally renowned folk choir Golden Gate.
In the choir, he befriended people who introduced him to the blues and who later became his bandmates.
The first concert of the band Ivan Blues & Friends took place on December 31, 2007 at the Rag-Time bar in Kiev.
Since then, the band has been performing regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools throughout Ukraine.
English author publishes book in Tagalog
"A Helping Hand" is the first book by Michael, a former BBC editor and mother of two, who has previously written for the Singapore Tatler magazine.
The book took three years to complete and is dedicated to his Filipino assistants, Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Narag, who help with cooking and caring for their son, Joseph, 4, and daughter, Florence, 8.
The assistants, whom he describes as "family members", helped test the recipes in the book, the first of its kind in Singapore to be published in both English and Tagalog.
"A Helping Hand" is available in bookstores throughout Singapore for SGD 39.90 and also in expatriate centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he got a stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were her symptoms so different?
In the trauma room, they gave him a high dose of acetaminophen to lower his fever.
For the rest of the day, he was interrogated, stabbed, beaten, and interrogated.
None of the tests came back positive, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood the reason.
For the past two years, he had been taking a drug called etanercept to treat Sjögren's syndrome.
The drug reduces the immune system's ability to fight infections.
Sjögren's is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious condition in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if by an invading organism that has wreaked havoc in the glands that produce tears and saliva and in some joints.
Weekly injections of ether had helped to reduce his joint pain.
But he knew that the drug would make him helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When the acetaminophen started working, the patient felt much better.
The trauma unit decided to leave him in the hospital for the night.
If it's the virus, as the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and sent home.
When Girard first heard about his new patient, he trained himself on the infections to which people who take etanercept are susceptible.
That was a long list.
Viruses cannot be treated before diagnosis, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One bacterium that attacks people with compromised immune systems is listeria, a foodborne bacteria.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheese, and it causes terrible nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which he never had.
Legionnaires' disease is another infection that has been common among people taking this medicine, but they have not had a cough or shortness of breath.
The more common bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can cause joint infections, but, again, he had no joint problems.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to introduce a comprehensive course of antibiotics that would cover all these risks.
But when I met the patient, it didn't seem like he was in any danger of serious infection.
The trauma room doctors hadn't given him any antibiotics.
The doctor had the option of delaying the antibiotic and simply watching and waiting, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, even a few hours of delay could have resulted in death.
Complicating matters, the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he could not remember what happened when he took it.
It created a risk-benefit balance between the two.
The decision to start or not to start antibiotic treatment, with its usually low stakes, changes when the consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning to take antibiotics, he just asked him to examine the patient and make a recommendation.
A colleague met with the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he would be virtually immune to infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has a history of penicillin allergy, Girard should have him tested to see if he can tolerate a drug that is not penicillin but a close relative.
Girard asked me to administer the test dose.
If he had a severe reaction to the medication, he would have developed a rash or his blood pressure would have dropped.
Neither of which happened.
That's why he was given a full dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face glistened with a thin layer of sweat and his cheeks were pink.
Although she seemed uncomfortable, her heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor was very happy to have given the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when he came to check on the patient one last time, he was sound asleep.
The fever was down.
The sweaty face and the pink cheeks were gone.
The next evening, when Girard returned to the hospital for his night shift, the first thing he did was visit this patient.
He had also received five other patients, but this patient was the one Girard worried about most at home after his transfer to the day team.
In the hours she wasn't seeing him, his blood organism had grown in the lab.
It was too early to tell what it was.
But it was clear that it was a bacterium powerful enough to allow Petri to grow rapidly, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or Legionnaires' disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them seemed really appropriate.
It took another two days before they could finally identify the bacteria.
It was listeria.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you get images of illnesses in your head.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease caused by unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
He went on to examine the material on this unusual infection and found that while people with normal immune systems may experience these symptoms, they usually recover as quickly as the patient's colleague.
However, in pregnant women, people over 65 years of age and those with compromised immune systems, the infection can spread outside the digestive tract - sometimes without the usual symptoms - and into the bloodstream.
From there, it can spread throughout the body like wildfire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, can result in up to 30% death in patients with this disease.
Indeed, while not as common as botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly.
Early antibiotic treatment can save lives.
If it's a foodborne disease, what food was carrying the bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed raw milk or soft cheeses during the trip, an Internet search revealed a listeria outbreak in Scotland this summer involving smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they did eat some smoked salmon.
Exactly where they picked up the bacteria remained a mystery.
Once the medical team had learned what was wrong with the patient, they could adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
Doctors advised her to rest for the rest of the summer, but she is now feeling quite well and has returned to the museum and her beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When the Kronos malware was first advertised in 2014 on Russian underground forums, the asking price of $7,000 suggested that selling the malware was a profitable business.
Kronos was advertised as a hacking tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PINs and personal information, useful in cracking security issues.
Motherboard reported Thursday that Hutchins was detained at Las Vegas International Airport after a week-long visit to the Black Hat and Defcon security conferences.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted to the arrest of their esteemed star with astonishment and skepticism.
Some warned that the charges against Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers - researchers who seek out weaknesses in software to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or sow chaos - and law enforcement.
Others were skeptical that Hutchins would develop such software for an attack.
In July 2014, he tweeted, "Does anyone have a sample of Kronos, which is an apparently strange prayer when he was the author of the malware himself?"
While the exact details of Hutchins' Kronos malware connection are unclear, security researchers have often ignored legal concerns in their search for vulnerabilities in computer code.
In recent years, large technology companies have issued 'error bonuses' to formalize the process for researchers to report problems and to compensate for their work.
The Defcon conference, an unrestricted gathering of security experts from around the world, has also had a tense relationship with law enforcement.
In 2002, for example, the FBI arrested a Russian encryption expert in a Las Vegas hotel room after he released software that authorities said could compromise the security of certain types of e-books.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, said in a statement that it was concerned about Hutchins' arrest and was investigating the matter.
WannaCry ransomware infected computers running older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After it spread, the software encrypted the users' computers and locked their files, folders and disk.
Once an infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became the so-called random hero.
In an interview with The Guardian in May, Hutchins said that he registered the domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to contact it.
When he registered the domain for $10.69, he activated a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a researcher at the Los Angeles-based cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic, said in an interview that he did not go to college and taught himself to write software.
The company did not comment.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his long-time friend MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was lauded by the cybersecurity community for this achievement and received a special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
The Senate has confirmed Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, as ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Johnson was Trump's biggest financial backer during the presidential campaign and was named chief financial officer of his inaugural committee in November.
A longtime Republican donor, Johnson also helped raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He was formerly Chief Financial Officer of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson's great-grandfather founded the medical device company Johnson & Johnson.
Former US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun.
Barzun was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned in January of this year before Trump was sworn in.
Belgian officials knew about the contamination of eggs in June.
"We were aware of the potential problems with the insecticide fipronil as early as June", said Katrien Stragier, a spokesman for the Belgian Food Safety Authority, on VRT.
We immediately opened an investigation and reported the matter to the prosecutor's office, as it may have been a fraud.
From then on, the investigation became classified.
We understand that people have healthcare questions and we try to answer them", added Stagier.
AFP has been trying to get information from the prosecutor in the case in recent days, but he has not said anything because the investigating judge has forbidden publication.
The chicken eggs have been withdrawn from the market in Belgium as a precautionary measure pending the results of the analysis.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from sale in the Netherlands and Germany.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to clarify the matter quickly.
"It is obvious that someone has criminally contaminated eggs with a banned product", Schmidt told the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Authority (VTA), eggs produced in the Netherlands contaminated with pesticides are unlikely to be present in Estonia.
'According to our information, there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia,' VTA spokesman Martin Altraja told BNS.
It added that there were also no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia.
According to the Statistical Office, no eggs have been imported into Estonia from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
The last time eggs were imported from the Netherlands to Estonia was in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil entered the chickens as a result of an attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat chickens suffering from fleas.
Reports in the Dutch and Belgian media that the pesticide ingredient was supplied to Chickfriend through a Belgian company have not yet been confirmed.
In higher doses, fipronil is considered moderately dangerous by the World Health Organisation and may have adverse effects on the kidneys, liver and thyroid in humans, especially children.
Is there a solution to preventing annoying robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, relies on customers calling and ordering chicken soup, pizza and fries.
But most of the time, it's automated messages trying to push through the fraud.
"It's getting to the point where it's not going to be possible for other callers to reach us", said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, but slowly.
Over the past year, new tools have been added to mobile phones at the urging of the government to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing phone companies to block more spam calls and hopes to deter fraudsters with hefty fines.
Experts say that these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state do-not-call lists should protect people from unwanted calls from long distance sellers.
But the crooks don't care that they break the law.
Fraudsters reach people cheaply and easily by using "automated dialling" devices that automatically make multiple calls at once.
It's estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are deceptive.
For example, pharmacies send automated messages about the completion of prescriptions.
But all too often, the situation is this: You owe the IRS money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; they offer you a free cruise!
In addition, garbage collectors use sophisticated technology that displays a local or important-looking number, such as a tax office, to the caller.
The implementation of appropriate measures for "cheating" numbers would make fraud more difficult and save millions of dollars for U.S. consumers, as the FCC's State Attorneys General team argued in the document.
Telephone companies and independent apps can filter or block unwanted calls by comparing them to databases of known problem numbers and analyzing suspicious behavior, such as a number that calls many people on a do-not-call list.
Wireless providers also have tools that add alerts such as 'Probable Fraud' to incoming calls, but these are not available on all phones or for many prepaid card customers.
Verizon and Sprint can order them for an extra charge.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, filter out junk calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas, 39, of Orlando, Florida, said her AT&T app flags and blocks certain fraudulent calls on her cell phone, but she has given up on phone lines.
"I very rarely receive calls from numbers I don't know", Vargas said.
Apps like YouMail and Nomorobo offer free but limited relief for home phones.
For YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional call forwarding", which forwards calls when the line is not answered or is busy.
Nomorobo is not available to all home telephone service providers and does not work with older, copper-based phone lines.
You can also buy gadgets, some of them quite bulky, that block calls on home phones.
Verizon is also testing the ability to display suspicious call alerts on home phone numbers.
The telephone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalize such practices and to allow for the blocking of calls from others suspected of fraud.
That means Verizon can block a toll-free number that takes calls for a fee but never initiates any calls.
Operators would also be able to block calls that they know are not legitimate, such as 911 routing numbers.
These rules need refinement.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy intern at the nonprofit Consumer Union, said these developments are "hopeful" but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
First, the no-call lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
And Mahoney said the FCC rules only cover fake numbers.
Not all robot calls are meant to be tricked.
The Consumer Association wants telephone companies to make call blocking tools available free of charge to all consumers.
In the longer term, the FCC supports industry's efforts to confirm that the caller is really who he claims to be.
Maybe one day you can see a green bird on your smartphone screen, if the caller is legitimate.
U.S. Telecom, a lobbying group for telephone companies, says that it may take years to implement, but it would be a powerful tool against robotic thieves.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop tracking unwanted calls to consumers who change numbers.
If you sign up for a Do Not Call list now but get a new number later, the salesman may not know and may start to bother you on the new line.
"Robot callers don't go away", said Aaron Foss of Nomorob, a call-blocking service for cell phones and home phones.
"They're criminals, and they find new ways to get around any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult as possible for them".
There are several logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone unless you know the number.
Yeah, well, that's not practical for corporate phone lines like Sports City.
Cut off unwanted calls.
Don't fight back or push any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they can tag you for anyone who responds and bury you under more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use the phone blocking apps.
If you have privacy concerns, check the app's policies to see if it shares your call or contact information with vendors.
Do not give callers personal information, such as bank account or social security number.
The preparations didn't go quite as I had envisioned.
"Not everything has been quite as I imagined", said Mägi of the training before the World Cup.
Friday-Saturday, there are important moments that show exactly how the body is.
And the competition shows that anyway, which we're analyzing here.
Today, I believe that my training has been of such high quality this year and in previous years that I can run normally on top of it.
The start of the preliminary race at 13.05 EST on Sunday after the home championships, Mäki did not do anything special.
In the last few weeks, they often overdo it with training.
I should have freshness, and it could be very useful, that the last week before the World Cup was a little easier.
Physically, the days leading up to the start are as follows: yesterday the obstacle runner rested, today he is doing warm-up training.
But she does not want to overdo her spiritual training: "Over time, I have developed my own routines.
It's quiet and peaceful and I don't listen to any rock music.
I don't need to watch any motivational videos or read any self-help books, I just need to be here right now and appreciate the opportunity that athletes from all over the world have come together in one place to compare their skills.
That in itself makes it special.
The World Championships are, of course, the highlight of the year for every athlete, and Mägi has taken every previous start, even the Diamond League, as an experiment - trying out some technical nuances, comparing himself to some competitors.
There's no more room for experimentation in the title race.
"The goal here is just to run fast", says Mountain, but he adds that if even a few percent of the energy is saved in the preliminary and potentially the semifinals, it will definitely come in handy in the next race.
The Finns were having a dance party for their men.
When the first men's dance was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably never dreamed that the northern neighbors of the small Estonian town would follow suit.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance party is being held in Lapland, in western Finland.
"The representatives of Lapua were so enthusiastic about the last men's dance in the friendly town of Rakvere that they wanted to organize something similar", said Kairit Pihlak, deputy mayor of Rakvere.
"Today, at Lapua Baseball Stadium in Finland, two performances of the Men's Dance Party will be held as part of the Finland 100 celebrations, with 100 men from Virumaa also performing", said Pihlak.
Pihlaku said it was a great example of good cooperation between two friendly cities.
It also marks the anniversaries of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundred dancers is the winner of the last season of Racket 69 Karl Reinkubjas.
"I am honoured to be one of the hundred men who, by participating in Finland, show what the men of Viru are capable of", he said.
"The men of Rakvere have set up their entire work schedule in preparation for the Finnish men's dance to show a decent level of respect for their northern neighbours", said Ain Suurkaev, a member of the Rakvere city council.
The Virumaa men's performance was completed by the dance ensemble of Tarvanpää by the artistic director Tiiu Myrk together with the famous choir leader Elo Üleo.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men's dance party was held in 2006, the last one in 2015 in Rakvere.
As we look ahead to the final of the evening's championship, will Gerd Kanter make World Cup history?
The current World Cup is Kanter's eighth, a feat that no competitor in London has achieved.
In addition, Kanter is the only discus thrower in history to win a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronze) at the World Championships.
As of today (August 5, 2017), Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
If the Estonian throws himself into the double world championship, he will become the oldest boxer to win a gold medal at the World Cup.
The same opportunity is available to Polish gunman Pjotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days old).
Other exciting facts:
Only two nations have won the world championship in the javelin more than once.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania two.
The world record for the event is held by Virgilijus Alekna, who threw 70.17 in Helsinki (2005).
The lowest score ever achieved is 66.20 - achieved by Riedel in 1991.
The results of the study show that beetles also spread seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are known primarily as decomposers, helping to break down decaying matter beneath the forest.
Peaches also help to spread the seeds.
Japanese scientists have discovered that cockroaches play an important role in spreading the seeds of the wild species Monotropastrum humilis.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll, so it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species gets its nutrients from mushrooms growing underground.
The plant shoots small, fragrant, pale white fruits on the forest floor.
The fruits have little or no flavor, and Japanese researchers found that birds and mammals are not interested in them as a food source.
Only a handful of vertebrates consumed fruit meat, and the wild cockroach Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruit.
Researchers tested the excrement of the cockroaches to see if they helped spread the seeds.
The researchers found that each stool drop expelled after eating a fruit contained, on average, three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the digested seeds were viable.
Scientists speculate that this unique plant species may have evolved to exploit the ability of cockroaches to spread seeds.
The seeds of the plant hang close to the ground and ripen as the beetles emerge from their new stage.
The researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"Given that some 4,600 species of beetles have been identified so far, seed dispersal by beetles may be a much more widespread and as yet simply undocumented mechanism than simply the unique ability of a particular plant species to exploit beetles", said Naoto Sugiura, associate professor at Kumamoto University, in a press release.
"It is hoped that the findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and beetles and to look further for examples of how beetles spread seeds".
The Duchess of Cambridge's childhood friend should have had a "right to die"
A childhood friend of the Duchess of Cambridge, who was suffering from a terminal illness, should have been allowed to end his life, according to his mother.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duchess's group of cooks, begged to die after a three-year battle with a brain tumor that had caused her "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity".
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral palsy was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but her mother said she suffered terribly before she finally died in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, of Newbury Berks, has called for a change in the law that would allow terminally ill and mentally competent people to "control the manner and timing of their death".
He said that his daughter's agonizing death had caused him "a great trauma", and he wished that the law would have allowed him to devise a plan that would have allowed his daughter to die with dignity if her condition worsened.
Chinese Internet censors are playing a complicated game of cat and mouse
Experts say the shift, which could affect a wide range of users from researchers to enterprises, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the power of the Internet.
"The restrictions seem to be getting more intense, but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever", said Emily Parker, author of "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are", a book about the Internet's influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Internet in Beijing are on a par with the Internet's influence in China.
Experts say China has not yet fully strengthened its controls and in many cases the cat and mouse game continues.
One day after Apple's move last week, people started sharing on Chinese social media a way to access these tools, which they say is so easy even a tech nerd can do.
This involved registering a human app store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
Still, Thursday's test shows China is willing to turn the game around for the cat.
Several Chinese Internet service providers said on Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials were testing a new way to find Internet addresses of their services that host or use illegal content.
If they are found, the authorities will ask the providers to demand that their customers stop such activities.
If customers continue, the service providers and Chinese officials will cut off their communication minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a fax request for comment.
Studies suggest that in China, tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people use VPNs and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
While foreign TV and pornography blocks are a deterrent to many, they present only minor challenges to China's vast community of Internet users.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new controls on the Internet for years, but he has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors in China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has become more central to what's happening across China, the government's controls have evolved.
The extent of the new efforts is difficult to determine, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly for fear of falling into the disdain of the Chinese government.
However, some frequent users have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to circumvent the restrictions.
A student who is studying in the United States and returned to China for the summer vacation said that his local VPN was blocked.
She said she took the period as a form of meditation away from social media and left a Facebook message to her friends explaining why she felt like she was going underground.
A doctoral student in environmental engineering at a Chinese university said that without Google, doing research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative printing so that students do not always need the Internet.
He claims he's now found a new way to get past the Great Firewall without revealing what it is.
According to Chinese Internet watchers, some VPNs are still working and China could do much more to intensify restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do this, it would have stopped VPN usage much more", said VPNDada, a website that was launched in 2015 to help Chinese users find working VPNs.
"If the government had sent more cats out, the mice would have a much harder time", said a representative who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the group's work in China.
"They probably didn't do it because they have to give people or companies some breathing room".
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current atmosphere is due in part to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, the 19th Party Congress, in the fall.
Five years ago, prior to a similar encounter, the VPN suffered unexpected outages.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complex and often flawed political process.
Analysts say government departments are under pressure to show they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem.
"So it's definitely not the apocalypse of VPNs", said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at consultancy Eurasia Group.
"The more sophisticated environment for users to navigate and the new options and approaches will simply allow China to better disable certain parts of VPN usage at a time and place chosen by Beijing", he said.
The Chinese population is learning to cope with these challenges at an early age.
Earlier this summer, Chinese internet giant Tencent began limiting the time that people under 18 are allowed to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing them to do so for one hour a day for those under 12 and two hours for those aged 12-18.
So Chinese youths have turned to an age-old solution - fake documents.
"Do you have a game time limit on your Honor of Kings?"
Are you interested in getting a document that shows you are over 18?" asked a recent ad on Chinese social media.
"No problem, you can have it.
Please contact us for a cheap document".
Estonian heavy-duty horses to be evaluated tomorrow at the Agricultural Museum
This Saturday, August 5, the Estonian Heavy Horse Day will be held at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horse breeds, alongside the Estonian horse and the Thoroughbred horse.
This year marks the 23rd edition of the Day of the Heavy Horse and a total of 17 heavy horses from across Estonia will be attending the event.
On this day, young Estonian heavy-duty horses, mares and healers are compared and evaluated.
The work of the best breeders is also recognised.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse population is over 350 in total.
The breed preservation and use of horses will also be introduced at the Upper Tower.
On the same day, visitors can visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, see the EV100 cereal and rye fields and participate in thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages will find activities.
Children will enjoy exciting games, ride a pony or horse, participate in a drawing competition and visit the Three Pig Science Theater.
There is also a summer village offering Estonian food and handicrafts.
The Estonian Day of the Heavy Duty Horse is organised jointly by the Estonian Horse Breeders' Association, the Estonian Horse Breeders' Association and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The breeders are supported by the Estonian Breeders' Association.
Cancer-speaking cat Genie named Cat of the Year
A rescued cat who supported its owner during bone cancer treatment was named the national cat of the year.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson, 11, of Lincoln, during six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016, and Genie says the company helped her cope with several painful surgeries and long hospital stays.
The cat was recognised by the cat charity Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.
Photo caption: Evie says that the cat helped her when she lost her long brown hair to chemo
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
She's always been there for me", Evie said.
"She came to my leg in the chip and sat at my feet.
He sniffed the cast and then jumped on the couch to pat my knee.
When I was too sick to have friends visit or to go out and had to stay home, she would come to me and make me much happier, offering much comfort".
Evie says that she has a special bond with her pet, which was a tremendous support when she lost her hair to the grueling treatment.
"It made me very angry because I had long brown hair.
But since it was springtime, Genie was getting the same hair, and the fact that I lost my hair and Genie lost hers, it kind of eased the shock a little bit".
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat has been a "great distraction" and described how Evie used to watch videos of her beloved favorite in her hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it gave her something to look forward to when she got home for some precious days".
"I missed him every day when I was in the hospital", said the 11-year-old, "and my family said that he missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him".
Report: Mueller convened a grand jury in a Russia investigation
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that a special prosecutor investigating possible ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign has convened a grand jury.
The newspaper reports that the grand jury hearing is a new and significant development in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump or his top advisers conspired with Moscow to promote the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, the former FBI director who now leads this critical investigation, was appointed, prosecutors had used jury pooling as part of their investigation into the activities of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was unaware that Mueller had begun using jurors in his case.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1st because we want to get this thing done", he said.
"In light of the news of the entire federal grand jury convening, we have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation".
NBC News has not independently verified the Journal's data.
The full use of juries is a standard part of a complex investigation and is not a tool for merely hearing testimony but also for obtaining information and data from individuals or companies.
It's a powerful tool prosecutors can use to seek indictments and subpoenas, and it may indicate that Mueller's work is far from done.
Trump has denied that he or any member of his team conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied any role in Trump's surprise victory last November.
The president's special counsel, Ty Cobb, said he was not aware that Mr. Mueller had begun using a new jury pool.
"Jury-related information is usually classified", Cobb said in a statement.
The White House will support anything that will expedite his work to a just conclusion.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed".
The Flying American under the black sail.
Of course, I've heard of flying ships.
Who wouldn't be?
The wingers fly between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's not that big of a deal.
The Swiss company Supramar introduced the first "foiling" boat, the Freccia d'Oro, or Golden Arrow, in 1952.
The technology was there before, but now I'm facing a wind-powered ship.
A catamaran, but still a sailboat.
What formula is it supposed to use to blow up?
But let us save ourselves the trouble of finding it and look at the simple farmer's concept of "foiling".
Why do planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the aircraft is propelled at high speed, air flowing at different speeds under and over the wing creates aerodynamic lift, at one point exceeding the weight of the aircraft and lightening the entire machine.
Basically, the same process happens in water.
The right-shaped wing creates lift as it travels at high speed, which in turn lifts the "sticky" base out of the water.
It's easy, right?
It gets tricky when you get to the numbers.
The plane needs a minimum takeoff speed of 150 to 250 kilometers per hour, and the current world speed record for sailboats is "only" 121.1 kilometers per hour.
But let's not get stuck in high school physics!
Today I came to see a flying catamaran called the NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is the acronym for the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is short for Flight Control System.
This is a system that allows the crew to set the sail in mid-flight, and 20 shows the length of the sail in feet.
Once the catamaran is released from the covers, it's clear this isn't the Sunday man's flag.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest stayed in the cage today.
The pipe and the glasses couldn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
That's the speed in the cube.
"Is that carbon fiber?" I ask, pointing to the sail.
Yeah, it's all made of carbon fiber.
"All the gum then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat", is the short answer.
170 kg - the three of us who are going on board will certainly weigh more than 170 kg.
I compare everything from laundry soap to dinnerware to cars, and I can't even turn this around here - the NACRA F20 is like a street-legal weapon.
A goddamn Zonda R or a Ferrari FXX.
Built with one goal in mind - to drive really, really fast in controlled conditions.
An amateur sailor would also be surprised by the amount of safety equipment he would need to wear before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, socks, special-fitting beads, sailboats, equipment, special life jacket, helmet, and a small hat.
There's a feeling in the battlefield that in addition to the balloon, and as well as the ocean, we could colonize Mars.
"So is it a good chance we're moving?" I ask in a humorous tone.
"Yes", is the short answer.
"Have you been around a lot?" I'm still probing the surface.
Okay, this can't be a joke.
I'm minding my seat belt.
The relevance is also underlined by the fact that the Nacra F20 FCS requires a support boat and a minimum of two crew members to be at sea.
Three tops, so there's not much room.
It's getting to be a little bit of a wonder why this isn't a Sunday cruise.
" Blog Archive " Land and road improvements
I still have a keen eye for any land reclamation that was once considered a profession, whether in the forest or in the field.
The quality of the machinery and work has improved considerably and everything is done more efficiently than in the past.
The main task is to reconstruct former land improvement sites, to find and repair faults and bottlenecks.
Added to this are stricter environmental requirements that were not addressed decades ago.
New building materials have been used, such as plastic pipes to replace the old iron-concrete pipes for the construction of pipes and fabric, called geotextile, to secure the ditch beds in addition to the stones.
In the past, the moats and trunks were secured with cast concrete slabs (MP, VKP) and mortar.
To protect the environment, sedimentation ponds are dug in the collecting ditches before the drainage water (underground drains, ditches) reaches natural streams or rivers, which should clean the water of possible residues of fertilisers and toxins.
Wolf's nests are often planted at the bottom of new ponds or ponds or grow from seeds that have flown in.
Hunting dogs have a knack for filtering out toxic substances from water.
The pond in this picture was dug last year and this week, the bottom of the pond was leveled, a concrete ring well was built to collect fire water.
And to prevent any machine from crashing into the pond, large piles of rocks were probably carried to the edge of the field.
In addition to clearing the fields, the area is also being repaired for forest roads.
The forest road section in the picture should be part of the fields, which will also receive additional gravel.
On the right is the state forest, whose reconstructed road continues just above the crest on the right and will be completed soon.
There's a private forest to the left.
The highway continues and there are also upgrades to the crop-grazing and roadways and remediation of identified drying faults.
