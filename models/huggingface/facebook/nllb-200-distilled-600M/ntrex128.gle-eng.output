The British Government is concerned that they will have a negative impact on the environment.
There is a gap between some EU Member States before the proposal that their entitlement should be changed to MWPs (British Parliament's MPs).
The move was prompted by plans to change the name of the meeting to the British Parliament.
There are parties across the political spectrum who are ready to become their own masters.
One AM told the Labour Party that his troubling group that he is ruling with Twp and Pwp"
Target for readers from outside of the UK: Stupid twp and cac pwp in British.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was not satisfied, and alternative recommendations have been made.
One person told the Conservative Party that its groups were page-wise about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet in English.
In this context, the letter w in British English is thus pronounced together with the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "It is obviously up to the Assembly itself to make the final decision on any name-reporting of Assembly Members".
The British Girl Scout was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which received broad support for the naming of the meeting as the Young British Parliament.
The Commission's choice of the title of the NAMs was made by Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but the most supported MWP was the choice of public consultation.
The draft proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the right to a fair trial is a key element of the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the directive to the Member States.
The legislation on the other reforms shall include changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of Members and on the design of the committee system.
The final votes will be cast by the HAMs on the title they will be given when they pass legislation.
It's a voting day for the Macedonians in the river to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia".
A settlement was reached on the river as part of an effort to endure the long years of border crossing with Greece, from which a fifth is also known as Macedonia.
The government in Aithin has long maintained that its northern neighbours' name is the same as a claim to their territories, and has raised protests after the vote against its EU and ECAT membership applications.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the same as the price to be paid if membership is accepted in the EU and ECAT.
Silence comes at St. Martin's Church and a break arrives at Chapels in Harlem
"Historically, the ancients I spoke to say that there was a bar and a chapel around every corner", said the Lord.
"Neither of those are today".
He said the passing of the bears was understandable.
"People go out different ways" today, he said.
"The children's seating rooms are no longer the ones that people go to on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders want, "and they will just be back where they started sooner or later".
The churches could be replaced by shelter buildings, which are full of people who do not help with the shelter's needs in the vicinity.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white-skinned", he said, "and so they will be pushing forward the day when these churches are completely destroyed because most of those who move into these churches are unlikely to be members of them".
Both churches were built by white-collar communities before Harlem became a blue-collar capital - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martins a decade later.
The Modhach base population with white fever developed in the 1930s.
A blue-collar crowd took the title of the building, a crowd worshiping close by.
A blue-collar community took possession of St. Martin's under the Honor. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against 125th Street retailers, was on a shopping highway in Harlem, opposed to hiring or raising blue-collar people.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parish commissioned Father Johnson to design the plan when they devised plans for reconstruction.
The Hon. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, was the co-founder of the program.
The expert who sang the program in July gave him something else: "Cultural text" and "historical musical instruments whose perfect match could not be found".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that the world's first recording of a blues musician was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main organ at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said St. Martin's had not obtained his representation.
A complex affair between archers and conspirators has been witnessed at St. Martins over the past few months, with some of the church's top leaders being introduced, and some of them being introduced by the espousal diocese.
The bishop - the parish's own governing body - wrote to the diocese in July about his concerns that the diocese would look to refer the costs to the bishop, although the bishop was not involved in the hiring of the priests and contractors on the diocese's journey.
Some of the priesthood's people were critical of the lack of transparency on the part of the deity.
A 13-year-old shark is injured while swimming under the influence of a shark in California.
A 13-year-old shark boy attacked and injured Saturday while swimming on a California ski slope on the first day of the winter solstice, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chad Hammel said he was swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then cried out to help him get out of the way.
Hammel said he thought at first that there were only climatic birth scratches, and then he realized that it was a bicycle.
We were caught!'
All his deeds were connected to each other", said Hammel when he approached the boy
"I saw everyone leaving the bar: 'There's a shark under the bar!'" Hammel told him.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified as in poor condition.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
Retreat Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press briefing that a shark was found in the area a few weeks ago, but was not considered a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his neck.
Offices closed the beach entrance between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles indicated that there were no more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's is about to land on the UK stock market.
Sainsbury's will be competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams for their multi-store-style scheme packages and a special assistant staff.
As part of the £2.8bn campaign, which continues to grow despite declining sales of fashion and home goods, the scheme's additional benefits will be tested in 11 stores across the country and delivered to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in schemes is part of the efforts of the supermarkets to fill the shelves with television, radio and timetable items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its scheme items by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The overmarket is also reselling its Boutique smithy range, so that most of the products will be used by vegans - a demand that more young shoppers will have.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will be testing flavor in two shops with Sainsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out of the year.
The trends of online shopping and the daily purchase of small quantities of food at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the stores will gradually look like multi-storey stores as the chain of stores seeks to come up against the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put Argos centers in hundreds of stores, and also introduced several Habitats since they bought those two store sets two years ago, which they say boosted grocery sales and contributed to the profitability of the additives.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the public health authorities are able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the public health system is not affected by the risks of the disease.
Sainsburys co-founded Western Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after concerns about how to share profits from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but added an additional scope to the social care brands now to include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have seen a shift in the benefits of a scheme from the ground up to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in expert colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all demands, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now targeting excellent schemes that challenge the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones ar mire after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million market
Peter Jones of the Dragons was left in a coma after the television show Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million market with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and with ITV
Willoughby has no time available for his brand of goods and accessories Truly.
The business and Goop brand have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow..
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has put on a red flag the star Peter Jones of Dragons Den when she withdrew from her profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on their new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and with ITV.
Our sources said Jones was "on the edge" when a white television girl during a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of her in-house business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - at a cost of up to £1.5 million - to focus on her Truly luxury brands and accessories.
The business was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune estimated to be equivalent to £11 million.
And while 37-year-old Willoughby, announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones went online out of Britain with one of his vacation homes as his target.
The source said: "Truly one of Holly's priorities was to.
It would be a long-term future for her to work her life for decades.
All those involved in the decision to withdraw from the market were withdrawn.
No one believed what was happening because the place was so close.
A storehouse is full of goods inside the Headquarters in Marlow ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's most trusted startups, could cost the company millions of dollars because of the significant investment in insulation and storage products and clothing and homewares, and could lead to further delays.
And it could end a friendship that lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, with whom she has three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with West Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production business.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will take part as Ant McPartlin's representative as a guest host on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said: "We do not comment on matters relating to his business".

He laughed at the criticism he received from the news media for the comment that would be unpresidential to some people, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said while admitting he was a news anchor.
"I have not given up anything".
He noted that Kim expressed interest in the second meeting after his inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have reached the end of their term.
It was more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly last Saturday that the North does not see a corresponding response from the US to North Korea's initial efforts towards non-arms.
The Commission's comments on the situation in the Union are based on the fact that the United States has not yet ratified the Treaty.
Trump had long been a non-conformist in his slang speech.
"We are doing great in relations with North Korea", he said.
"We were to enter into a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die if they did.
And now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said that positive results came from his efforts to improve relations with Kim - the rocket tests were ended, they helped freeze the bodies and bring home the bodies of members of the American armed forces.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presumptuous, but instead of 10,000 people outside asking for permission to enter this flooded space, 200 people would be standing in the stands", Trump said, referring to the crowd right in front of him.
Hundreds of people on an island are killed by tsunamis and landslides in Indonesia
After the land creation on Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need to be present.
Although no more than 10 percent of the Lombok population was evacuated from its own areas, no national disaster was declared, which was pre-conditioned to generate international aid.
"In many cases unfortunately they said unfairly that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is well challenged", said the Supreme Court.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign team can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the continuous earthquake in Indonesia, the preparations for the onset of the natural environment are terrible.
Although rockets were built against the tsunami in Aceh, they are not common on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning base in Palu, although a warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of livestock.
Travel between the many islands of the Indian Ocean is challenging when it comes to fishing.
Logistics becomes much more complex with natural disasters.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved India's fragile infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funding for Joko's administration led to his re-election the following year.
Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the religion.
No more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced by clashes between Christian and Muslim rebels in the streets, and massacres, riots and spears, and other deadly weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge with Liverpool includes the balanced score at the final day in Chelsea's squad
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the Premier League with his score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri and it was about 30 yards away from the Chelsea bar and his team to walk 1-0.
He had the ball on his left foot before he tried to throw the ball too far away.
The attempt was made wide above the box and it was approaching the top right corner of the filling.
The ball jumped right over the Cape Arrizabalaga and eventually fell into the mouth.
"I just wanted to get there, get the ball, and players like Shaq go forward as much as possible, so I just tried to prove as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and gave one small shot to the ball and I didn't think about it so much and made the effort back".
Chelsea were 1-0 down after scoring in the 25th minute against Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The low-start with his shoulder passed the team in the blue-west corner as far as Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he moved from the middle of the park and raced under Liverpool's half of the park.
Kovacic passed and quickly disappeared into the middle of the park.
He passed a beautiful pass through then, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and took the final ball into the ear of the bow too far with his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the group stage of the Champions Series at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 3 p.m. on Friday in London.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of dead in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been affected by the building's construction that was linked to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit last Friday, and a wave as wide as 20 feet, as agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman announced to a press release.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was filled with smithy from buildings that fell into each other.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after his wife died
An investigation has been launched into a murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police were searching for people in the area who had heard or seen nothing to get to them.
The Deputy Speaker Brian O'Hagan said: 'We are early in the investigation but I would appeal to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who thinks anything of their cameras to contact us because they could have information that would be crucial to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and that she had been found inside property.
Friends of the woman who believe they knew her came to the scene this evening to ask questions about her whereabouts this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as the police said they were currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him that no one is allowed into or out of the building.
He was left a void when he learned about what had happened.
Residents are now told that there will be a number of hours before they are allowed back in.
One policeman was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being used as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, sealing the flour.
She keeps saying 'this is terrible'.
Two veins were with the police inside the line of defence at 2 a.m., with another vein just outside.
Several police were standing within the line of defence watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Chromail inside Parliament is the last monument to be the subject of controversy over the historical record.
The destruction of many of England's religious cultural treasures would be compensation for their complete destruction by the Taliban at the hands of their fanatical followers or the Puritans about how they were baptized.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as "a great effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the idea is expected to have a real Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster as its target.
The break-in in English civil wars was neither ordered nor committed by Cromail himself.
The Chromail may be wrongly sacrificed for measures Thomas had previously signed.
The real beauty of William Hamo Thorneycroft's invention of Chromail is evidence of 19th-century speculation, and it is part of the historiography of someone many people believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps no more so in the 19th century than today, would say that Chromail was a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in this case against monarchy of course.
This is still a matter of historical debate.
It is a well-established belief that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation since then, and that it is an individual who represents one half of the entire population.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration".
A Chinese farmer is violently attacked to death by a pig killer
Farmer pigs attacked and killed inside a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man by the surname Yuan was found dead with his cutthroat artery, and bluntly cried at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
A pig farmer preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his four cousins from the neighbouring Yunnan fifth last Wednesday with 15 mugs sold at the market.
His four-legged friend came to us the next morning and he was dead, and found that there was a door valve with a mouse claw nearby on the spread.
He said there was a large pig in the mouth with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound mule had violently attacked the farmer or died, according to the report itself.
"My legs were four feet of blood and honey", the four-legged man, nicknamed Wu, said of the incident reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera's screenshot showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Friday to feed his pigs.
His body was found around once not later.
Yuan and his four cousins were not the animals that killed the man.
A market manager told the Evening News that the lock was closed so that it would not attack anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan people and the market authorities are reportedly in negotiations for compensation for his death.
The reports contain rare cases of human trafficking.
A woman and her husband were attacked by pigs in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and suffered critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a British farmer had a pig weighing 650 pounds per drawer or his wife had slaughtered the animal.
After his farmer's mosquito ate in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that mosquitoes are not normally aggressive but that bloating can act as a shiocair.
"They are only passionate about fun.
They're like you, they're real like animals... they're not eager to hurt you.
You must show them full respect", he said.
Heavy rainfall will hit the southwest of the US from the harsh shores of the Rose River
As predicted, the hairy Rosa is weakened and moved across the cooler shore off the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will be raining from the northern part of Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa, on the Hurricane of Category 1, had winds of 85 miles per hour at about 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is approaching across the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a destructive storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north into the southwestern United States.
Up to 10 ferry routes with Rosa will arrive in parts of Mexico next Monday.
This will then be followed by widespread heavy rainfall with the destructive humidity interacting with the sound coming into the Southwest for a few days.
Between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause accidental landslides, smog streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Destructive humidity will cause moderate rates of 2 to 3 or more inches per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that between 2 and 4 inches of rain will fall in parts of the Northeast, particularly over most of Arizona.
The conditions for rapid deterioration due to the spread of the teochronous rainfall may be affected.
He was determined to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of the teak-crustal forest.
Heavy rainfall could cause terrible flooding on the rivers in the valleys, and local winds and seeds could be sold by the storm surges.
Some rainfall will come with the sound approaching corners of the southern California coast.
The number of floods could be over half an inch, which could generate minefields and slip roads accordingly.
This is comparable to the first rainfall of the region's wet season.
Several rainfall streams will begin to spread near Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the more widespread rainfall spreads late next Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy storm will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Thursday.
Sharp fluctuations in temperature can be seen in October across the US as the Arctic Ocean clears, with the temperature remaining moderate.
This results in dramatic changes in temperature over the winter.
A fantastic example of the amazing temperature variations will be seen across the central US on Sunday.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the final heat of summer will try to rise again.
The warm start of October is forecast to be seen throughout much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures in the 80s spreading across the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could be found at 80 degrees on Tuesday, with 10 degrees in and out above the average temperature.
We are indicating with our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
No more than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
No more than 20 million people watched the fictional testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's name to the Supreme Court and the woman he accused of sexually assaulting, alleging that the 1980s attack, Christine Blasey Ford, took place on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political unrest continued, with broadcasters breaking into regular recordings for Friday's final case: an agreement negotiated with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona with the assistance of the FBI to lead an investigation into the changes that would last a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh raped her while he was drunk, and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said he was one hundred percent sure it didn't happen.
No more than the 20.4 million people reported Nielsen on Friday probably watched it.
The company included the media coverage on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks on display, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And some figures for Nielsen usually involve measuring the number of people who look into the offices.
As a comparative measure, the number of spectators is the same as for a qualifying game in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose host-reporters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ranked among the networks with an average viewership of 5.69 million during the full-length hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of last Friday's drama.
After the Republican official issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning receiving a lunch from commentators and trying to pick up a lift to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes on it for a few minutes as they pulled it off, airing on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth before the nation?
Someone told you, "you have the power and many women have little power".
Flake said his office issued a statement and told him, before the elector was drafted, that he would have nothing more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering matters hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would expose the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic majority had been demanding.
They were talking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons, who was accusing Flake.
After a conversation with Coons and several elders thereafter, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the right to vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has told her constituents that they are engaged in political games on Britain
Prime Minister Theresa May has told taxpayers her plans to leave the European Union that they are engaged in political games about Britain's future and national interest while interviewing the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, is attending the Labour Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the front page reader, Boris Johnson continued his attack on his plan for Britain, or the Chequers plan as it is called, saying that the proposal to have Britain and the European Union tariff each other would be a "sephardic" outward proposition".
Wayde Sims: Police arrested the late Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU's immigrant
Police arrested suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU football player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released video of the Sims and Simpson incident, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the raid.
Police detained the mirrors from the scene and said they had DNA on them from Simpson, as reported by WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde deadly.
The bond was settled for $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report last Friday, stating that a gunshot wound to the head and neck was the cause of death.
The department is acknowledging the Louisiana State Police's task force on robberies, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their determination and determination to bring justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch starter grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne also attended LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU head coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "confused" with Wayde's death.
"That makes a matter of concern in the ground", Wade said.
Soil erosion from a downward volcano in Mexico City
The foam is squeezing out of the Popocatepetl volcano after hitting distant areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Flood Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after the increased activity inside the sanctuary, and recorded 183 gas and lead emissions in a 24-hour period.
The centre was guarding multilevel thorns and rocks.
The images on social media showed thin layers of lead covers on the windshields of the cars in areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists took place before the independence vote was evenly celebrated
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independence speakers and police, and thousands taking part in competitive demonstrations to celebrate one year's equality from Catalonia's divided vote.
The police were holding back with egg-shaped, powdered painted clothes and a blanket of white cloths, creating dark dense streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
The day also saw flights, and police used their handcuffs to limit the fighting.
The independence was voted on by the cantorate No Deference, No Pardon directly in front of the united representatives by the mayor of Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries in the riots, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region where the demand for independence has been high for a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid deemed illegal, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be independent by a large majority, although the percentage of those who came out with the ballot was low among the parties opposed to the split of the majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last week after police tried to block the vote at polling stations across the region with violent threats.
There were protests in favour of independence after Friday night's demonstration to prevent support for the national police.
The production continued, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the demonstration of the separations with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia to gain independence.
"We had one of the best moments of our lives last year.
I saw my parents crying with surprise that they could vote, but we're pissed now", he said.
Despite Catalonia's decisive victory in the regional elections last December, the independence parties failed to maintain that continuity this year with many of their well-known leaders either holding their own or being detained pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the freedom proclamation.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old technician who recorded the broadcast to support the police on her phone, said that the politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"The tension is rising incessantly", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of a number of Catalan leaders jailed before his trial at the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To compete as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to criticize the collapse in democratic values and the backlash of the Spanish government", he said.
City of Durham: Men arrested after their home was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were arrested after a car hit a house in Durban.
The incident occurred on the Chorrán Bay of the Quard on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
The Cigarette Speaker Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossover may also have been released with the car at some point.
Menga's score gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
The first turn was by Dolly Menga for Livingston who saved the win.
Livingston had an unexpectedly impressive win over Rangers, and it was Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end and Gary Holt's team came in equal to Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's team winless out of the season in the Premier League as they face Hearts, and they have eight points to lead, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home earlier against Rapid Wien in the Europa Series next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile adds his number of games without losing to six games, and head coach Holt remains unbeaten since he joined Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not score chances against Malaysian visitors
Holt's team should have progressed a lot before they scored, and his direct method to Rangers encountered many difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the column but put his attempt across the mouth of the column, and then Alan Lithgow could only put his attempt in after he slipped in to hit the head of Craig Halkett across the column.
The home team were willing to let Rangers play for them, knowing that they would harm the visitors from home with the fixed items.
And this is how the back was scored.
Rangers gave up a free kick and created Livingston a semi-final, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
The Rangers were in possession of the ball by then, but the home team's defenders failed to break through and there was no penalty for the murder of Liam Kelly,
That story continued into the second half, although Kelly had to rescue Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers hitman Alan McGregor had his feet on the door to Scott Pittman and Lithgow flipped in from another constant meeting with Livingston.
Cross passes entered Livingston's box continuously and were permanently cleaned, and two demands for Irish chic were rejected - after Halkett challenged rep Glenn Middleton, and one on handling.
'Incredible evidence' from Livingston - analysis
Alexander Lamont with BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A proven and excellent result for Livingston.
All of them were improving, exceeding their expectations that way.
His running style and personnel have changed little since they returned to the mainstream, but Holt should be highly commended for the way he has inspired the team since he joined.
He had so much heroism.
Captain Halkett was improving, overseeing the royal-organized defenders, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their watch from the start of the end.
Rangers saw a lack of inspiration.
Although they gave excellent evidence of Gerrard's existence, they came to greatly violate his standards.
They missed the last pass - they only broke through the home team once - and it's kind of an open-eyed look for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.

A blue sky and moonlight were seen on Saturday (29 September) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
The last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to straighten relations between the ECAT allies.
The negotiations were successful on a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then turned to Cologne to open a new massive mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey itself is found in that city.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the crowd, but many of the supporters came out nearby to see their president.
The praise of the hundred commentators against Erdogan was also heard - many of them in Cordians - sharply criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's previous decision to welcome the country.
The partial challenges are a reflection of the visitor's willingness, being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and sharply criticized as a hero by others who are not.
Road report in Deptford: Wheels get killed by a car crash
Wheels have died in a collision with an indoor car in London.
The near-closure incident occurred at about 10:15 BST between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics responded on the spot, but the man died there.
The report comes a few months after the death of other wheels in a road accident and a run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Sabbath.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are closed roads and bus routes, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during the interrogation
Six prison officers have been injured during a prison camp at a men's high security prison, the Prison Office said.
The accident occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Officials and specialists from 'Tornado' were brought in to deal with the hurricane, which affects eight kilometres and is limited to one lane.
The officers were treated for injuries sustained on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "A dedicated prison team has been deployed to tackle the ongoing crisis at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be brought before the police and that another prosecution may be brought into custody".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison had received medical treatment in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And Cuban officials were called in last October to deal with a serious crime in which the team was attacked with balls of poison.
Rose's Syndrome threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood targets (which could harm underwater areas)
A devastating flood is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as the energy flow of the Rose River flows over the Northeast Desert, and risks flooding targets.
The National Weather Service has ordered tours of southwestern Arizona Monday and Tuesday into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be making a stand by Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix specified in tweets that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm status or weakened within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hair Center pre-measured 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter, and separated sizes up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rockies and The Great Basin, appear to have 1 to 2 distinct valleys, and may have total divisions of up to 4 valleys.
For those who are now out of the danger of turbulence, the Rosa desert could be a blessing because the region is thriving.
While flooding is a serious concern, some of this concern may be beneficial as it is currently severe in parts of the North-West.
According to the US Triumphal Survey, at least 40 percent of Arizona is at least diametrically opposite, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the Rosa Hair is found crossing the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still has a strong wind on Sunday morning at a speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is hitting cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus has lost power.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm late on Monday evening or late on Monday.
The flooding in parts of Mexico could be severe, and there is a significant risk of flooding as a result.
A 3 to 6 hour tropical storm is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, and could be as high as 10 hours, reported weather.com.
Rosa then travels north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical wave, which then passes through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main movement expected from Rosa or her very distant neighbors is in California, northeastern Sonora, and the US Pacific Northwest, says the National Hair Center.
These are expected to produce life-saving tubers and smog streams, and land grazing in the mountainous landscape.
Midsomer Norton attacks: Four arrested for attempted suicide
Three boys in the twelve and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy who had been stabbed several times in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police say.
Officials are requesting anyone who may have a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that he suffered, grief, anger from the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unconventional tactics and scandals of the Democratic Party, Trump said while slumping in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered grief, and anger from the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally accusing Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
President Godfrey said that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage that day.
A vote to certify Judge Kavanaugh is equivalent to a vote to certify one of the most qualified legal qualifications of our son, a lawyer with an excellent public service record, who has been sent to the West Virginia bar.
The President directly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination, speaking of the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, and I'm running really, he said.
That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates.
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to deny and block things.
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership spokesman told CNN.
Hundreds of dead on the ground, Indian hunters and the number of dead is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, and many people and large waves washed up on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) circled the beach at nightfall, splashing many to their deaths and destroying anything in their way.
The earthquake occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not immediately escape and were therefore killed, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indian disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said at an information session in Jakarta.
The gunman did not come by himself, dragging cars, boats, houses, hit everything on the ground, said Nugroho, saying the gunman traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the landing board.
Some people climbed trees to escape the flames and came out safe, he said.
Some 16,700 people were relocated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster agency's air photos show many destroyed buildings and shops, complex and broken bridges and mosques and water around it.
The coastal city was built by God the Father.
The series of earthquakes were recorded in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earth's magnetic field on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long cave, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "slow" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels fell.
Several victims' bodies were found in the basement under the roof of the building that fell, he said, and said 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the floods and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 mi) northern edge of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earth's capital.
Nugroho said there was no information at all in the messages from Donggala.
Some 300 000 people live there, said the Red Cross in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the places to strike.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse, she said.
The agency strongly criticized Satyr's God for not giving the information that the gunman hit Palu, although officials said a wave had entered within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur social media film, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard giving a scary warning about the names of the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water creates a seawall, leading to buildings and cars.
The film was not immediately authenticated by the film crew.
A major power outage occurred due to the earthquake and tsunami that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun launching cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but food and other basic necessities are still needed on the ground.
The city's airport was reopened for one more visit and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the displacement centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The Indian Ocean tsunami killed hundreds of people in 800 BC.
It's always been hollow.
While the World Vision team from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, where employees are trapped in tarpal fossils created in the closure of their office, they encountered a crisis along the way, Mr Doseba says.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's all hollow.
Even as aid groups began the relief work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep experience were being hindered from travelling to Palu.
According to the Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and staffing will not flow from abroad until the presence of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
But it is still a level five collapse, says Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indian Red Cross.
As soon as the government decides, O.K this is a national disaster, we can open up for international assistance but there is still no status.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, the friends and families of those still seeking to make their imaginary people miracles made natural disaster victims lighter still had hope.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the car.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been in a smuggling detention camp for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indian national parading team, trained two of the aspiring parading teams for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that his students were among the others who were signed up at the Roa Roa Hotel.
As a practitioner in the field of parenting, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr Gendon reportedly, in the moments following the spread of the rumor of the fall of the former Eastern Township among the parliamentary community, sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach party, as he stepped out of his power pole with anthem.
But his messages resulted in only one gray tick, except a pair of blue ticks.
I think that means that the messages were not delivered, he said.
$26,750 in deposits during ATM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
He received $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink worker who was carrying out the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was flipping an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, the newscaster Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
When he was busy, another man came from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to deliver.
Witnesses saw some suspicious people leaving the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap musician changes his name to Ye
Rap musician Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The man you used to call Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time now and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace Ariana Grande who had her show canceled for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West previously said the word was of religious importance to him.
I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means to", West said earlier this year, when he was discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy radio show.
So I am you, I am we, we are.
He changed from Kayne, meaning the only one, to Ye - which is a direct expression of our good, our bad, our misery, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of rap musicians to change his name.
Sean Combs had previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made no flashes and no big letters.
AMLO Mexico pledges not to use the military in civilian clothing
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force in civilian clothes and the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeance in student clothes.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza pledged to use the military to bring down Mexicans.
Trupps on a peaceful demonstration bombed the blast on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to corporate drongs.
The United States should double its A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its research expenditure in that area, says AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple at the time.
The comments come after different parts of the US government make AI announcements, even in the event that the US does not have a full formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its ambitious plan: it aims to be the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, considering that all other countries are far ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
By doubling funding, the chances of doubling the first major AI discovery in the US would also be high, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player a top rating, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous US government technology competitions such as the Advanced Defense Research Project's Robotics Challenge Agency and asked when the next one would be available, to help identify the first other sightings.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
China is not pushing away academic leaders; it is corporate companies, Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years are employed by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help boost U.S. AI efforts.
I think that a green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI, Lee said.
The State Council of China adopted its Development Plan on Second Generation Free Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Fair Work Intelligence Forum, which brings together industry and academic partners to participate, and the White House announced the creation of an Intelligence Committee on Fair Work Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no activity has been seen in recent months in US legislation to allow the National Security Commission to create a free intelligence.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether or not they would change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday whether or not to change their name to Republic of North Macedonia, a measure to resolve a twenty- or thirty-year-old dispute with Greece that had banned its proposals for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a fifth name Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbors have a claim to its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments made a market in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist rivals argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the predominant Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a campaign of boycotts has cast doubt on whether or not the number of people who will vote will reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot of the referendum was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in accepting the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is even more important to consider entering bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
I came today to the future of the country, to the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union as it means safer lives for all of us,' says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would listen to the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would require the change of name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of votes were cast, compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name to pave the way for its participation in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and was pulling up chairs in front of a pub built by the people who would be babbling on the river.
We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to take membership with pride, not through the service door says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have a dictatorship.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide a very important investment for Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
I believe a very large majority will be in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a vote in favour would be the determining factor of our future.
In a poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - depending on the number of voters required.
In another poll, conducted by Macedonian Televisions, 57 of the respondents were found to be planning to vote on Sunday.
At that point, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
In order to reach the referendum, only 50 per cent of the total number of votes must be cast.
The river's impact would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero makes his way through Manchester City all defenders Brighton for a penalty
They were defeated by Brighton's defenders Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling in a 2-0 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's score looked all too easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine starting line-up got a pass in the middle of the park at the start of the series.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders, before briefly entering the open park.
There were four glass leaflets around Aguero then.
He pushed around one defender before he ran over a few other defenders on the edge of a Brighton box.
He pushed a pass on his left side then, coming to Sterling.
England's starter used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right arm to secure the victory over Brighton's left-back, Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right hand of the winger.
Aguero has some problems with his legs, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about putting it on for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were told that he had scored back at that moment.
But it was Steirling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League clash.
That back was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's soil on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to the other end.
Sky Blues starters hit the ball into the mouth before it flew over the border.
City will be joined by Hoffenheim in a Group Stage Game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer would like to play spoiler against the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the competition the game was decided, there was little reason to forge a new start.
But a competitive fanatic Scherzer hopes to take the lead Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if there are game implications solved only for the Rockies, who are ahead with a single game over the Angeles Dodgers in the Western WL.
The Rockies won at least a special playoff spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they are still looking to win a first division title.
While we're playing without a cause, at least we'll be able to get our foot in the door by three games and we know the atmosphere here in Denver will be crowded and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any point in front of me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that?
The Nationalists still have a beginner's vote for the Saturday, but they are said to usually let Scherzer pitch in such a case.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, spent a Friday session of the loca practice and would be pitching his usual pace on Sunday.
The Washington native is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is firing in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the case in relation to his choice in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be in danger in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not running but I'm really running and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates, he says.
Trump then said, You see the radical group of grains, these grains, you see it happening right now.
And they're focused on returning power by using every means necessary, you see the warmth, the warmth.
They know not who they will be, nor who they will set up to take power and authority, which is the desire, power and authority; we will not give it to them.
The Democrats' mission is to reject and block things.
"You see, it's been four days", he said, "and he's bringing grain and wheat and salt and spices and lies to the people".
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee classifying Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Democratic nomination, and the audience was actually high on the list.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
Didn't break, uh no, I'm waiting for one - that whole body signaling was bad - the worst body signaling I've ever seen.
The Labour Party and the wider church no longer exist.
They have no take on those who speak out
Although Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last person in the line of Labour Party Members who have been told there is no welcome ahead - all of which is a shame we have spoken out.
My colleague Joan Ryan was almost equally rejected for her resolute opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the plot I filed for dissent with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, of national security, of Europe, questions that Jeremy has, ironically, withheld from past leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday specified that we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive.
For most of my eight years as local Labour Chairman, this was exactly how the Friday GC meetings were.
Sadly, today, that is not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the commitment to politics more racially, even more so if it has ever really begun has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different recognitions in Labour parties and that all opinions are assessed on whether or not they are accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view expected me to make a fundamental change and take positions we would never agree with other than that - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and no matter what I say - there will be a vicious streak on social media calling for deregulation, criticizing the politics of the day, telling me I shouldn't be a Labour party.
And that's not just an experience.
In fact, I know that I am more influential than some of my colleagues because the comments I am directed to are usually about political matters.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a series of sexual or gender-based misconduct every day without turning back.
One of the most discouraging aspects of this political era is the current acceptance of levels of badness.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer that broad church and with every resolution minminine or change in election rules the party is getting tighter.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years recommending me without drawing attention to myself, without speaking out so much and then I was right enough.
But I did not agree with the politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the Thatcher government's neglect of leaving my comprehensive school classroom crumbling to the ground, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local adviser or as government care.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
It would not seem that anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my policy stance and areas I disagreed with regarding the current leadership.
To those who promoted the resolution on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is on the brink of Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not about the Nottingham Momentum, but it is about my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that any threat of deregulation or political exercise will not stop me from acting in a way that benefits you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes not to the top
Two minor outs may have put the final score on a material basis, but there is no indication Ayr deserved a major Tennants game this day that was all too exciting to win.
They're at the top of the table now, the only team out of ten that didn't.
In the end, it was his excellent defense, as well as the way they took chances, that helped the home team and the coach Peter Murchie was right to be happy.
We've tried our games so far, but we haven't yet, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie de Melrose said: "A tribute to Ayr, they took better chances than we did.
Grant Anderson's lead in the 14th minute, which saved Frazier Climo, led Ayr, but, due to a yellow card from Albanian player Rory Hughes, who the Warriors released for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the charges and Jason Baggot took an unprotected lead.
Climo's sign began Ayr with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then he saved a preab from leg to hand to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with Patrick Anderson's wood, who saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Roger Knott, who was taken off the park on a free transfer, and from the start, Ayr pushed forward through the fall through Stafford McDowall's wing, who saved Climo.
Active captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay off with Bruce Colvine's unrescued skin at the end of a spear of fiendish pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from attacking Climo without the ball, from extending out the penalty kick, MacPherson rebounded Ayr's forward-moving back.
Climo's strikes, as he had been doing since the start almost, after Kyle Rowe collected a high kick over his shoulder David Armstrong and set off the defeatist Gregor Henry for a fifth-place finish of the home team.
Still Game star seems to be going with a fresh appeal in the food industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after learning he has been named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford's 56-year-old role as Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, a show he writes with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill and is a companion to.
The duo announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the last during the season, and Kiernan appears to be planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to participate in a successful food trade Glasgow.
The sea is a blue: the tragic bomb is expected to open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a quarter of a fleet equipped with rigs in La Paz.
There is a huge amount of water on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with manna: The sea is lined from right.
It is a duty to get it back.
Throughout the Bolivian plateau, the memory of losing its temperament against Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still generational - as well as the tide that launched it into the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope has been high for the last twenty or thirty years, and Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
Bolaiv has a momentum, a spark of unity and peace, and of course it expects the outcome with a positive outlook, said Roberto Calzadilla, spokesman for the Bolivian delegation.
Many Bolvacs will be watching the CBI control of large screens across the country, and are confident that the bank in The Hague will favour Bolvaiv's claim - after sharp talks over the past twenty or thirty years - that Chile has a duty to negotiate and to give Bolvaiv a dominant position at sea.
Evo Morales, the incumbent Bolivian president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - is also making a big splash on Monday's rule.
We are very much looking forward to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to decide in favor of the Bolivians - and little change would be made if it were to decide in favour.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant a ceasefire and has ordered that it not decide the outcome of any possible talks.
The decision of the ICC comes exactly six months after the final arguments were heard, showing that the case was not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a specialist in international law.
And not only has the Bolove case been prosecuted, but it could have been prosecuted in the past four years.
The current administration of Bolivia has taken ownership of the issue of access to the sea, Zárate said.
Morales' offensive backing made any goodwill that Chile would have left us untouched.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to discuss it afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of the Bolaive in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was more rigid than usual.
A fantastic opportunity will be given to open a new era of relations with Chile on Monday and a chance to end 139 years of negotiations with the EU, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent foreigners - had used the maritime issue as a political support.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The rule is to see that we must break history.
North Korea said nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first unless it had confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking to the United Nations General Assembly.
It called on the United States to act in accordance with its word on the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the militant factions.
His concerns include the apparent resumption of a stalled nuclear diplomacy by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "haunting" that continued US sanctions and the refusal to declare an end to the North Korean War would leave the country in peril.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes its first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread speculation that Pyongyang is actually rejecting a laboratory that the country seems to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris shows the latest line in a massive headline that is on its way to the main street near you
If you want to make your hat collection more or block the sun completely no more searches are needed.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a massive masterpiece range of their SS19 collection on the exhibition stage that was implemented in the style set by Paris Fashion Week.
There were a lot of very unpractical hats on display across Instagram this summer and these designers put their incredible work on the miniature stage.
In the visual piece with Valentino there is an oversized baseball hat with broad leaves like the cloves of a manikin's clock.
Other massive adaptations included water bottles with jewelry, a witch hat and even an anthill - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne revealed a strange mask selection as well in time for November.
Many of the masks were silky lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One work was like scuba gear, snorkels and swimming glasses, and some were like a conch of spread ice cream.
And if you follow the statement even in a huge way - you're fine.
Style watchers have suggested that the large, slender vines may be making their way to the major streets near you.
The giant hats soon follow 'La Bomba', the two-leafed hat on a leaf that was seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural label behind the highly unpractical hat that was being displayed on social media put another major work on the miniature stage - a beach bag that is almost as big as the miniature that the carrier's skeleton carries.
The burnt orange raifia bag, with a French raifia trim and light leather straps, was the visual piece in Jacquemus' collection SS19 La Riviera Week Paris Faisin.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags to hit the main street next summer - since the designer had so much influence it would be hard to ignore the massive adaptations.
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Albania maintain a certified account of academic excellence, followed in 2018 by another series of excellent examination results, reinforced by the success of individuals and everyone together in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30, 000 pupils across Albania, these schools, represented by the Albanian Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for their chosen profession and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where we can design and implement school-specific curricula, we are seeing the rise in popularity of modern languages and their choice of subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to cultivate relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the most recent examinations this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
68 per cent of the total number of students studying foreign languages earned an Honours degree.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS membership schools, showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an Honours A Degree in Mandarin, while 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent also studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now seen as a choice of subjects, as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects are seen in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers gave for their difficulty filling a vacancy were that 17 per cent of them were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As languages are needed for more potential job opportunities, these skills are essential in a global life.
Regardless of the vocational course chosen, if they have learned a second language, they will have the real benefit in the future of having a lifelong skill like this.
If you are able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, you will automatically be promoted to a multilingual competitor.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language that a decimal percentage of them had, 15 per cent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
If children, especially those in developing economies, have more than one language, they are more likely to find solid employment.
Different languages are taught in all schools within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on the most contemporary and classical languages, while other schools will teach the languages considered to be the most important languages for the UK in the years ahead, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with a teaching staff of specialists in this field.
Independent schools in Albania are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and imparts the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
At this time, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, languages should actually be viewed as scales of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Albania.
I'm going to watch.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council of Albania.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is so long to be around for fans to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he'll play has yet to be decided.
"It'll be more than one minute and less than 48", Walton says on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-week preseason schedule.
I don't have any pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare for, he said.
When Trump was shot in West Virginia, Channel You Tube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of protests today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five launches over the coming week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote for his Supreme Court vacancy retained, Trump plans to gain support for the midterm election because there is a risk that Democrats will lose control of the Federal Parliament, when votes are due on November 2.
When will the West Virginia Trump rally take place tonight and how can it be watched online?
The Trump March in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, now, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump Rally in West Virginia can be watched live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak about the ongoing hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was intensely involved in allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main aim of the next week's slugs series is to help Republicans, who face intense competition, intensify their campaign.
President Trump's campaign thus indicated that these five launches during the coming week were aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their numbers in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Constitutional control is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season progresses, said Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, to Reuters.
Wesbanco's arena is currently slated to be in Wheeling and could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain media publicity in Pittsburgh, according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is seeking to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the popular polls.
 The President's coming to try to boost the popular vote is not a good sign for Morrisey said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Corn Ryder 2018 US Team shows that they are eager to be promising ahead of Sunday's single bets.
After three unilateral sessions, a fourth game on Sunday may have been what this Ryder Corner wanted.
Speed is the ultimate concept of a developed sport, but it is strongly believed by players, especially in competitions like this.
So, where's the momentum now, do they think?
It was a point ahead and now it's reduced to four points, so we have a little momentum, I would say Jordan Spirit said as he walked out on the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage, four points ahead and 12 points to spare.
The Americans are hopeful, however, and they have very good reason to be hopeful, especially because Spirit and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, during the day and can claim to have won three out of four points.
Spirit is playing great from house to house and is setting a good example.
The collector's cornerstone rose higher as the bat went on; he scored a necessary goal to win his fourth game, when he and Thomas were two-to-one after two pools.
He won the game at 15 and let the car go, the kind that tells you that the American team has not lost the competition.
"You must keep your head down and focus on your own game", the Spirit said.
That's what every player has left now.
18 pulleys to leave.
The two players, who have more points than Spirit and Thomas, over the two days that have passed are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the story of Chorn Ryder.
Four out of four European couples have won, who are just happy and can't do anything wrong.
The only couple who did not hit the bulls on Saturday evening were the Mollywood, but they also kept the bulls on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the second nine o'clock on Sunday morning.
The innocent game they played and the way they received energy from the glorious audience shows that they are both the players to be defeated on Sunday; and no player would be more willing to achieve a European victory by going under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them won out at the same time, but at different odds.
But it is too soon to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to beat Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four balls, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spanish and the Swedes were in a hole and could not escape after getting bouts and two doubles in the first nine holes.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you escape a hole you're in yourself.
The four balls and the four-ball game are so attractive, if closely observed, of the interaction between the pieces, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way in which strategy changes in the eyesight.
Europe have played better as a team up to this point and they are well ahead going into the final day, but this quarter-final showed that there is a passion for Team USA, although some people, especially in the United States, were skeptical.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good lead early on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four balls and the quarter-final, when they led the United States 10-6.
The exciting pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the contest when they had two wins over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
The European side, Thomas Bjorn, who was seeking the crown, which they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, was again in the fourth round, defeating the United States team in the final, which ended the series 3-1.
The American team had a very strong four-ball score; they lost two games but failed to reduce the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's single games to keep the horn.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who were crowned Molliwood after a weekend's overtime, are the second pair to win four points in the four-match series in Ryder Cup history.
They had a huge victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and they played two as a unit to win over Woods, who was vulnerable to him, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods, who had been struggling in two games on Saturday, has now retired again but has lost 19 of the 29 games he has played, now in the four balls and the four games and has lost seven games in a row.
Justin Rose took a break when the four balls were played this morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the quarter-finals and scored 2 and 1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are certain to be the world's first and third-best goalkeepers.
Europe was not easy, however, on a pleasant day, a southern retreat from Paris.
Alongside Jordan Spirit, who won the main competition three times, and Justin Thomas, the standard fell to the Americans when they scored two points on the Saturn.
They won their decisive victory over Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals and then went on to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the quarterfinals, although they lost the first two pools.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from a four-point deficit in the single competition, although Furyk's team is only required to be on the scoreboard to keep the championship, as they won the championship last year.
After being in second place for two days, however, they are unlikely to be able to counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is no chance of a unilateral disarmament because of lack of confidence.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were adding to the lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally lift its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has shown a very strong commitment over the past year, in that it has halted nuclear and nuclear weapons tests, dismantled the nuclear testing site and pledged to not increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we don't see any similar response from the United States, to him.
No confidence in the United States, no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm, initially in bold.
While Ri again made a popular complaint about the United States, which opposed a  gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given a disfavor, as it took small steps, his statement was significant in that he did not reject a clean unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri cited a speech made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the still-in-office US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula as long as Trump pledged to protect North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons early.
Washington has also opposed an application to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on the initial "de-nuclear" and increases pressure on sanctions to achieve their target in a coherent manner, and even opposes the "war declaration" of war, Ri said.
The idea that we can abide by sanctions is an idea from people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which continue, are adding to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no reference to another summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If South Korea, rather than the United States, were the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament, nuclear disarmament would not be a problem for the Korean peninsula.
However, the way in which Ri spoke in his speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was unlikely that North Korean missiles would be fired on US soil after Trump, Mr Evil President, rocket man called Kim on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, although he threatened last year to cause a total disaster on North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump said he had no specific time for the disarmament, saying, if it takes two, three or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia agree that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council sanctions must be enforced vigorously and without any delay until nuclear disarmament is fully achieved and certified.
The Security Council has increased, unanimously, sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go too well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made; but North Korea rejected him within a few hours because he had made demands about how chemistry would work.
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon this month, promised to eliminate the presence of a nuclear threat if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the corresponding measures were Trump's security pledges in Singapore and steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get a degree.
A new course has been launched at Harvard University this year to increase sleep at all levels to counter the growing farming culture, where caffeinated study is done at night.
A scholar found that students at the world's top-ranked university have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put together the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the reading, a young girl came to me and said: Why wasn't this told to me before, when I was in my senior year?
She complained that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first made available this year, explains to students the key points on good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic performance and athletics, as well as improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university medical services, said the university made the decision to introduce the course, when it found out that students were very sleep deprived during the week.
Interactive tasks are a part of the hourly course.
One section features an image of a seanlios, in which students snuggle on coffee shops, curtains, training shoes and books to answer the effects of caffeine and light and the way in which lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told that sleep deprivation can be long-lasting and that they have an increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus is then painted with interactive icons, the participants reflecting on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know- as you would have a right to know about the health effects of smoking on you, said Professor Czeisler.
He said there is still a culture of the greatness of 'sleeping in your seat at night'.He said modern technology and the pressure on students, which is constantly increasing, meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Students should ensure that they have good quality sleep as a secret tool, he said, to avoid stress, drowsiness and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to be hungry, as it is often hungry.
Raymond So, 19, of California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said he opened his eyes and began to search for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to do the same study programme before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at dawn time and be aware of the adverse effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. They can disable their daily rhythm and this creates sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's back to Gerrard's man
Rangers again lost out on home ground as, due to the loss of the lead Menga received, Steven Gerrard's home team were beaten 1-0 by Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first home win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but were beaten by Gary Holt's team, second to Gerrard's 18-game breakout as manager.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before halftime and there was no likelihood that Rangers, who lacked inspiration, would score.
As long as Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third place and the difference is only the back between them.
Further trouble may lie ahead for Rangers, after the line man, Calum Spence, received treatment for a head injury from some subject thrown from the audience away from home, according to a drawing.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the team that easily beat Ayr to secure a place in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11 players, who took a point from Hearts the week before and would be very happy to the way in on the stones of his well-trained team the fighter's husband.
The Rangers may have owned the ball for the most part but Livingston took more of the property they stole.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who led a chick towards Allan McGregor's back but went on a foul.
Keegan Jacobs took a free agent who went to Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow failed to get his chic but put him on the bench.
Rangers took control of the game, but it turned out that they had hope rather than faith in the type of intervention they were taking, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had a winning Irish chick after a quarter, when he hit against Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson did not accept Columbia's man's request.
Rangers managed to put just two chic towards the heel but Ibrox's former black back Liam Kelly had no difficulty breaking into the headquarters of Lassana Coulibaly and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's chick may have been in the 34th minute against the time pattern, it cannot be denied that they did not deserve it because they had overworked.
Again the Rangers fell on dealing with a fixed item in the starts from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond to a pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave a pass to Menga, who turned it down.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change was immediately affected as he passed to Morelos, who hit him towards the corner but knocked Kelly, who had a super-game, off his line to cross the ball.
But Livingston continued to lure the visitors to play the kind of game they liked.
Holt's team could have scored more towards the end of the game but McGregor stood the test well to overcome Jacobs and Lithgow hit his head from a corner kick that went to the ball.
Rangers rep Glenn Middleton had a late request for Irish chic when he had a dispute with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, saw in the opposite direction.
The following is a list of the countries of the European Union.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today .......the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring pre-action, the discovery of which led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger Assessor.
Geiger was a pioneer of science since the 1950s. In the 1950s, a film starred Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It is a Geiger producer, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the breathing that occurs from the radiation released by the minerals.
Evans: Yes, it's definitely popping up now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the named observatory is still there.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to check for stem cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to check and kill stem cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize stem cells as part of a medical procedure.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then check for proteins that are common in many organisms and then re-inject them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a cure with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system how to identify stem cells, all ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can check for a protein, which is common in many types of cancer, and is called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said:  Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that is highly hoped for.
Various types of HER2 cancer develop, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic and cholera, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked, in which immune cells were built from patients and taught how to target cancer cells to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West started to ski for Trump, while wearing Hata MAGA after being on SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was beaten in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving a free performance suggesting the United States and President Donald Trump, who would run for office in 2020, he said.
When he heard the third song called Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat. He began to protest against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
 I talk so often to a white person who asks: 1. How could you give a shit about Trump, who is not racist?
Well, if I was worried about race, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a magical sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Holywood star was framed for Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations, which was done by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it was not aired, the comedian, Chris Rock, uploaded Kanye West's coverage on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make a spell about West with the post.
In addition, the audience complained that he was grumbling in the back of the headset.
They beat me in the back.
"Do not take off your hat, " they told him.
They beat me!
And then, they say I'm in a low spot, according to the Washington Examiner.
West followed him: "Do you want to see the bottom? He said he'd put a superman's cube on it because that means you can't give me orders. Do you want the world to move forward?
Trying to love.
He was beaten at least twice by the dozens of things he said and found that there were certain staff members, a Variety report said; one person told the magazine; The whole studio was in his throat.
West was cast as the late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who had lost her great-grandfather, rapper Mac Miller, a few days earlier.
West threw many people together with a performance of the song I Love it and it was dubbed as the Perrier Bodeal.
The head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner supported West in tweets:  To one of the most courageous personalities: Thank you for standing up against the tide.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Kanye West was "like he is and that's all great".
But I choose not to compensate someone (to buy his music or support his art) who, I think, is accepting and releasing an ideology that is harming my own people.
It's free.
We, too,  on a breast.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his official name was now Kanye West.
They are not the first artist to change their name and follow the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap partner, Snoop Dog, is named Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, Prince, who does not last, changed his name to Snoop Lion and then to the artist already named Prince.
Charge of attempted murder in a carriage in Belfast.
A forty-five-year-old man was charged with attempted murder when a man walked into a village in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Hacamar City, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the District Court in Baal Feirste on Monday.
The Prosecutor General shall be responsible for the prosecution of the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking a man's innocence.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy, supernatural drama series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has called stereotypes of the male hero, saying that such parts of the screen are so appealing that young boys often think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of negative personality during the MeToo era.
Kit, who recently admitted to being married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
Personally, I feel strongly at the moment - where have we gone on a battle with masculinity? he said.
What lessons did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television may be responsible, to a certain extent, for the increase in performance, thanks to the extremely masculine characters.
He continued: "What is native and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets tells young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions of the child - how do we turn that around?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in pre-series or further stories when the series ends next summer, saying that there are no more horse and carriage parks.
From November, Kit will play a major role in the revival of True West Sam Shepard.
The actor recently revealed that he felt the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
I met my wife on this show and, therefore, he gave me my children and my future life, he said.
Rose starred Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the presence of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
The Commission has also adopted a number of recommendations for the implementation of the measures to be taken to combat HIV/AIDS.
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease is over 820,000 in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most new cases were spread through sex, a change from the previous story.
Traditionally, HIV spread through parts of China, resulting in an infected virus transmission.
But there has been a huge decline in the number of people getting HIV like this and, almost, no one is getting it like this now, Chinese medical officials in the fifth Yunnan said.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a problem in the Asian, Asian, Gendered and Transgender (ADT) community of China.
Human trafficking in China was abolished in 1997, but the LADT community is widely reported to be discriminated against.
Of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Much of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is lacking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to have full availability of HIV vaccine to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters says that staff members have leaked GOP senators' data and cited disserted papers and conspiracy theories.
United States of America 1. Representative Maxine Waters filed complaints on the Internet that a member of her own staff leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the staff posted the information on the law enforcement Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat reported that the information was being promoted by trafficker from the true-right movement and websites.
 Lies, lies and more lies  Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to include home addresses and phone numbers. United States Senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch both from Utah.
The information was made available online on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during your Senate panel examining allegations of sexual misconduct, filed against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made available sometime after the three elders had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified the source of the posts as being related to the Waters office and that the information about the Waters team member was made available which the Hill reported.
This allegation is entirely false, Waters continued.
The staff member - who has been provided with his identity, personal information and security, of the victims of these allegations, which are fraudulent and false - was not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
This allegation, which is unfounded, is completely false.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online.
This announcement is outrageous, wrote Fleischer.
This implies that she does not consider herself fit to be a Member of the Conference.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the reasons of the prosecutor.
He should be calm and calm.
Fleischer was likely comparing Waters' response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the prosecution of over-representing him during the Friday hearing.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate running in the election to win Waters' seat in the midterm elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
There's a lot, if true, he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the persons responsible, which she continues to pursue, are exposed and held accountable for their actions, which are transparent and appropriate to all members of the staff.
Johnny English is in the business of Recovering Rowan Atkinson's spyware without a point of effectiveness.
It is now traditional to see whether the importance of Britannia is in any new film that has a British inclination and it seems this is meant in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which involves a re-enactment of action in comic form.
Will the language in the pipeline be self-sufficient, as far as we are concerned, as a new export right for the nation?
However, Johnny English has again obtained a license with the Bulgarian eyes to praise a subject. His name suggests that there is a comic character created for the people attending the cinema in non-English speaking countries.
It is, of course, not the secret, seamless, up-and-coming agent who thinks he is seductive, but who looks like Clouseau, a mix of Mr Bean and the man who provided one note for the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is based from the beginning on the traveller and the international man, a mystery that Atkinson took part in Barclaycard's television commercials at the time, but is now forgotten in that he left everything in his shadow behind.
There are a few nice points in this movie, the latest JE.
I was very impressed by Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter as he was fitted in a mid-range riding hat and the rotors hitting against his cloak at one point.
Atkinson's success for body composition has been apparent, but the genre is real and exaggerated, in particular, because film brands such as James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer a genre as part of the films.
The play seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and I personally don't have the Johnny English satirical myth of the Mr. Bean play in Atkinson's silent films as intense and focused.
The basic understanding now is that Great Britain has a major problem.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a secret network of British spies and the names of British agents have been leaked. This puts the agent on duty at a very low risk, unfortunately, to Kevin Eldon.
The disaster is a blow to a principal, a serious man, who is under pressure; already, he has a complete breakdown in public opinion: Emma Thompson struggles with the character, who looks like Teresa-May, but can't do much with the script.
Her information advisers inform her that the name of each spy has been leaked and that she must find someone, who is safe.
And this is ineffective Johnny English. He's employed, at the moment, rather cleverly, but he's giving classes, in a secret way, about how to be your secret agent.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and is again hit by his former partner, Bough, who is called Ben Miller who takes that part again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a boss on a farm, a small hereditary party, which has Vicki Pepperdine too much in it.
So Batman and Robin, who find everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action. They meet Ophelia Bulletova, an attractive, beautiful woman, whose son Olga Kurylenko takes over the role.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being sued by billionaires of tech savages who claim that he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin on an official plebiscite essay: while dressed as servants, they put a French galley dish through a ditch; they create a roll of a punch while boarding a Volta galley, secretly; English creates a material, when he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to spread information on the inside of a Volta house.
They make their best effort for the final episode, but while it's fun and exciting, the whole thing looks like children's television.
A fairly modest matter.
And as for other Johnny English films, the thought came to me: can the British film industry contribute to Rowan Atkinson, who is fit for his potential?
The Labour Party says it is planning a four-day work week for British workers but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan, in which Britons will work four days a week, but they will be paid five days.
The party is reported to demand that the leaders of the bodies give workers money, which they will save through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, in the form of an additional day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still have the same salary.
Sources said the idea of changing the party's economic programme and plans for the country in favour of workers would be a good idea.
The Conference of the CEOs has agreed to the four-day work week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be recorded before the end of the year.
It will not take place overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal, which corresponds to the party's approach to benefiting the worker and the party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first group to support this idea, as the Green Party had a four-day work week during the campaign in the 2017 election.
The Labour Party, in general, does not, however, currently agree with the objective.
The Labour Party spokesman said: The party's policy is not a four-day work week and the party is not being assessed.
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Party conference to show his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from unnamed directors and from profit-making by utility bodies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in water bodies will not get their full share because the Labour government could announce discounting, provided something had been done wrong.
It also confirmed plans to give seats to staff on the boards of the company and to create Compulsory Ownership Funds and to give 10% of the shares in the company to employees, who are likely to receive annual allowances of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy with 60 Minutes asks whether or not an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
At least a week later, the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been cast, following an FBI investigation into allegations against the Kavanaugh Trial. It raises the question of whether or not the bureau's decision could change the minds of Republican senators and withdraw support from the Judge.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley's correspondents of Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could get any information that would change their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterparts.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
During my entering the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this, a voice came out and asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was firm, determined, he didn't put his teeth in it.
It seems, however, that Graham's vote is certain.
I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a serious charge, he said.
 Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: It's a Brett's sister, says Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she appointed can guarantee it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change it.
What is World Citizens' Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This small Saturday, New York will host World Citizens' Day, an annual event that is attended by many celebrities and also has an important mission: ending global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizens' Day and thousands will be drawing to the Grand Prix in Central Park to enjoy musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to highlight the event's definite goal, which is to end real poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Day is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012. The project is an international advocacy, which seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who struggle vigorously against it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the orchestras had to perform some tasks, or actions as volunteer work, email a world leader, make a phone call or use any other fun means to spread information about their goal of ending poverty.
How successful was the World Citizen and 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the real way to give free music a gift to people to encourage them to act, or is it just another example of people who think they are making real difference when they sign online petitions or send tweets?
Since 2011, A Global Citizen claims to have a record of over 19 million actions by its supporters, seeking to promote various goals.
He says these actions have helped to motivate global leaders to make promises and promote policies, worth more than $37 billion which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements emerging from its actions, at least $10 billion in grants or fundraising as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money received has already directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Among the pledges made is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and pledge-enforcer party, which is committed to helping children develop their resources to the best of their ability and pledges to provide a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 tweets from World Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, volunteers, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the destabilising social crisis said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition Power, to the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions called for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced a fund for projects, the Nutrition Power, which will help 5 million women and children intervene in nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, the question is asked  why do you think we can end real poverty?
A citizen of the world replied: "We will have a long, difficult road ahead - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Among the conductors taking part in this year's event, in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe.
The United States could use the Navy to launch a global campaign to block Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can use the Navy if necessary to stop Russian energy from being sold in markets, including the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's move in Syria, as it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government, is no excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to make energy arrangements as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe.
And, according to the officer, there are always ways to deal with it.
The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the offshore drones are kept open, and if necessary, to conduct interventions, to ensure that their energy is not available on the market, he said.
Zinke was speaking to the people present at the event, which was hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance.
He continued to make comparisons between Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that it is mutual.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is to have, to a large or small extent, an impact on and change fuel, he said.
The statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, coming in the place of Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump government officials, including President Donald Trump, are attempting to silence Germany's withdrawal from the appropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, according to Trump, have made Moscow's exit from Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a single economic project that costs $11 to increase the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin maintains that Washington is strongly opposed to economic causes and that it is an example of unbalanced democracy.
I believe we agree that fuel cannot be used as a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after his meeting with the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
Germany has responded to the United States' position and Germany has confirmed that it will continue the project.
The main industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industrial Confederation (GIC), has called on the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a serious problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Confederation (GIC) after recent meetings between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for President in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday she would consider running for the presidency after the midterm election.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider entering the competition.
It's time for women to go to Washington to set up the broken government and consider then a woman is in charge, she said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will closely monitor the presidential race.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the city hall, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
I am very concerned about the impact of Donald Trump on our democracy, she said.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have been publicly taxed.
In tweets on Friday, Warren said is sure we're under investigation by the FBI before we vote.
A poll conducted on Thursday showed that a large majority of voters in Warren's constituency believe she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by Suffolk University/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research.
Thirty percent of her support gave him the right to stand in the election.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick had more support, with 38 percent supporting him and 48 percent opposing him.
Among the Democrats, who were in the public's mouth to discuss the 2020 presidential stance, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin is playing a Late Night Stroke Injury (NSI), which is on Track Palin, in a shower for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
The police took him Monday night and charged him with domestic violence.
My own son has been suffering since he came back and I can understand the difficulties other families have with the Western Stress Syndrome.
Palin an gave something no one wants to talk about  about her capture and said about her son and other war veterans,  they come back and they are different, they are hard, they come back and they doubt whether the public appreciates what their neighbors and their allies and all other members of the military have done, what they have done to their homeland.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with aggravated domestic assault on a woman, making a report of domestic violence and possessing a full gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the challenge of the new policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new United States policy of refusing asylum to victims fleeing drug-related or family violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint in a courtroom hearing Friday in Washington to support a term-seeker, who was making a political statement, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name was not mentioned in the legal case, Grace v. Sessions, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner and her illegitimate son, who are members of a gang, abused her but U.S. officials refused to accept her request for a term on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state's attorney, who was supporting Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom are seeking asylum in the United States, were nations with widespread problems with drought and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy responded to a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of immigrants who allowed undocumented immigrants, fleeing domestic violence, to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "makes a blend of twenty or thirty years of state law, federal law, and international law".
Under federal law, all asylum claims must be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and the current ban undermines that principle, said the friend of the court.
Lawyers further argued that the policy, which prohibited immigrants, had harmed the US economy; they suggested that they had more opportunity to become entrepreneurs and to provide the necessary workforce.
The High Court, Jeff Sessions, ordered a non-refugee labour case against a migrant who was fleeing domestic abuse and child abuse in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their countries of origin, of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his policy statement on 11 June.
It was never intended to solve every problem - even every serious problem - that people face day to day around the world.
Despite the efforts made in Paul, the number of dead in the race to find survivors is doubling.
The story was getting more horrific for the people who survived.
I feel the tension, says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforts her young boy, who was suffering from a fever, at a displacement center in the burnt-out city of Palu.
Every minute a patient enters a car.
Clean water is scarce.
Settlers were seen returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, and they were forcing through personal items that were wet; they were trying to save anything, which was available, to save.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to cope.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken leg and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital as a patient was being treated, as powerful regulations were still in place.
The elephants were as he spoke about the terrible earthquake, which swept the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
A pressed hole broke into the wall, I think,  Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that her children were in a big house for marriage.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then everything was in ruins.
I don't know what happened to you and my baby.
I hope they are safe, safe.
The US ambassador is making a bid against China with a ballot.
A week after its official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page notice in a daily newspaper in the United States, the US ambassador to China in Beijing said that China was using American newspapers to spread bourgeoisism.
Last Thursday, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - that the China Daily paid for - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusation showed Beijing was seeking to interfere with the US elections at a new stage in a campaign, which Washington is increasing to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for credit governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a trade war, which is currently increasing and, consequently, has both imposed tariffs on their imports.
China imposed counter-tariffs early in the trade war to strike a blow against a state like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, who exports a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and workers.
China has used this bias by placing voting ads in American free newspapers, which Branstad wrote in an article featuring his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
The Chinese government is using the American tradition that the press has freedom of speech and freedom to spread its propaganda, when it posts ads, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, you won't hear many isolated voices at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing.You won't see the various opinions that the Chinese people might have about China's economic policies, which are biased, if the media is controlled by the Communist Party of China, he wrote.
He continued: One of China's major newspapers refused an offer to publish his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are knocking on doors to female voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, according to People Analysis.
As many major Republicans stand by while defending Supreme Court nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, despite some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a counter-response, especially from women during the midterm elections, to the restrictions.
People are very concerned about this and most of the Republicans have already said they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be ignored, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was suspicious of the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican), who tried at the last minute to get an FBI investigation to satisfy homegrown voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not claim it tomorrow and they will not claim it in November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
This Friday morning the alarm was "November is Coming!" to hear from protesters as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber.
The Democrats' interest will increase dramatically and will give them a lasting impetus, said Stu Rothenberg, an unabashed political analyst, to the news site.
People say it's high, already; it's in the truth.
But it may be higher, especially among women between two councils, in the suburbs and among younger voters, people aged 18 to 29 who dislike the President but do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which revealed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's namesake, analysts speculated that there might be a counter-response if Republicans continued to confirm the name.
This is a key step for the GOP, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National People's Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee or the final vote or who gets Kavanagh on the ballot or not, it's also about the way Republicans deal with this and how they spend it, said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it appears that there is a split between Americans, though both believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh and a few more believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is or should be fully believed and 35 percent of respondents said they believe Kavanaugh's testimony is or should be fully believed.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they believed, wholly or absolutely, that Kavanaugh lied in his testimony as long as 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure put on Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported by the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez said her descendants' names of the Supreme Court were revealed when they were present at a concert when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who conceived the New World Internet Network has plans to launch a challenge to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is to launch a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the renowned technologist, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where they store their data and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated explicitly that the only thing that is desired by Inrupt is global promotion.
We need to do it now, he said of the initiative.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create a personal data repository, online or create a POD.
It may contain contact details, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's about how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available on one browser and all available at the same time.
The specific feature of the online personal data store is that it is only for the user to give access to a person who has a particular type of information about him.
The body provides personal data.
Inrupt's idea, according to its CEO, John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers on the team, who have a contract to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own unlimited apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which their business models would be committed to overnight fundamentals.
We are not seeking leave to remain.
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the misean of Inrupt was to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, to help protect the impact and quality of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet from a baseline, when he founded the World Wide Web Cooperative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, a voice, influential in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet, has been in Berners-Lee.
Even when he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Integrity, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am very optimistic about the next era of the internet, said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration is held under the clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War 1.
A clergyman in the Church of England, the only one to have won the Victoria Cross during World War I, is celebrated in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Honorable Bernard Vann, won the rank on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But the doctor killed him four days later and he never knew he had the highest rank in the British army defeated.
Two stone memorial statues were unveiled at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said that there was a "magnificent symbolism" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the title.
According to the London Gazette of 28 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann directed his expedition across the Canal de Saint-Quentin three heavy rounds and under heavy attack from park guns and machine guns.
He then pushed up to the line of the shooters and with excellent bravery guided the line forward before turning the park rows in solitary and setting three of the descent.
The German navigator killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War II.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I could never do but something that goes to my heart.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann left a wreath after the parade, which led to the founding of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was a great honour to take part in the parade and also said that the support of many people showed genuine courage.
IMMA fans sat down all night to watch Bellator 206 but instead sang Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've stayed in your seat all night watching Bellator 206, which is full of bars but you don't get to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights on the list of fights from San Jose, six fights on the main list and it was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to fight each other, a stunt was made by the UK audience when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not too upset after they stayed seated until the early morning to see the fight.
One fan tweeted about the change to children's cartoons.
It was government regulation that the programme was not suitable and therefore had to be changed to children's programmes, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, who was in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the mouse, is it.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage to UK audiences in the future.
I think, when I think about the re-war, we can work it out, says Coker.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we won't be able to work this out until this time here on Sunday and then on Monday.
But we're trying to fix it.
I believe that when the programme changed then, there were many texts going sall and anall and not all spoke friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government question.
I can promise you it won't happen the next time.
We offered five instead of six rounds - as we usually do - and tried to provide too much for the fans and we went too far.
It's a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt the need to be sexually explicit.
Olympic gymnast Tom Daley says he felt like he was not as good as others when he was growing up feeling his sexuality- but that encouraged him to progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he went to high school that we were all like me.
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of older people to give hope to others.
He also said that since he was a parent now it was not so important for him to win the Olympic Games.
The show's regular performer, Kirsty Young, has built up several months free of illness.
On his first Laverne show as a man on a deserted island, Daley said he saw himself as a "lesser man" than everyone else, growing up as a "socially accepted" boy and girl.
He said: To this day, these feelings of seeing myself as a lesser person and feeling different, are the definite things that have given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things.
He wanted to prove that he was right, so that when his conduct was finally revealed, no one would be disappointed.
The man who won two Olympic gold medals is now a public activist for LGBTQ rights (LGBTQ, LGBTQ, LGBTQ and Transgender).
He said he spoke out because he felt that the elderly were able to live openly without any implications and wanted to give hope to others.
Daley, a three-time world champion, said he was "gotten knocked out" when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Oscar winner Daley married the elder, who is 20 years older than him but said there was never any problem with the age difference.
When you suffer so much at a very young age - he went to the Olympics, initially, when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his peers had so much above and below in his life.
The couple have been parents since June. They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that their overall outlook on life had changed.
When I was asked last year what was important, it was all about winning a gold medal, he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold base.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their ticket to the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting lineup.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be around to be in the starting lineup, Dad, on him.
I had a handshake on him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit he was unconscious until he stopped breathing and he was dead, he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
I knew that was my lifelong dream - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there could be no better feeling, he said.
It inspired her first choice of songs, as well - Proud with Heather Small - which influenced her in the preparations for the Olympics and still matters.

Mickelson, not functioning properly on the base of the representatives in Corner Ryder on the South.
The American Phil Mickelson will be reaching the top spot on Sunday when he plays a game in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but will be upgraded if he decides it will not be an unpleasant occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, sent Mickelson to the bench of representatives for four ball games and four games on Saturday.
Despite being in the middle of the late, as he often was for the United States, Mickelson, who had won five major tournaments, divided his time as a suggested journalist and practicing his skills on the field and hoping that he could solve a problem that was plaguing him.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not fully suited to Le Golf National's golf course, as the long-distance sailing regularly goes off to beach.
And if the course itself isn't tough enough, Mickelson, in Game Nine on Sunday, will compete to put together a British Open round robin, Francesco Molinari, who is partnered by Tommy Fleetwood, who is in his first year of eligibility and has won all four games this week.
If the Americans are off to a good start, with four points to finish at the start of the 12 singles matches, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he trusted him, but he could not say much more.
He fully understood his role here today, praised me and said he would be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
He is very confident of himself.
He is a man who has achieved great success in the past, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably never imagined him playing two games.
I was more concerned, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going.
You want to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will be beaming Nick Faldo's curse to the man who has played the most games on Sunday.
It may terminate a period which has never been as good as his personal endeavour.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said there were some disagreements for the team because of his presence.
He is aggressive, serious, provocative, likes to be spotted and is a great person in the crew room, he explained.
I think the young sportsmen were also shocked this week to see it.
It provides more than the game.
Thomas Bjorn understands that a great horse can pass without delay.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from his own experience that a good horse at the beginning of the final day of the singles matches in Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danishman first appeared in a 1997 game at Valderrama, as a team under his captain, Seve Ballesteros, five points ahead of the Americans but were hardly defeated by the lowest-ranked player, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a great rider at Valderrama; we had a great rider at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, where we were, but hardly, says Bjorn, who is pictured after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to be ahead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will tell me and everyone else that this is not around.
Immigrate one hundred percent tomorrow.
Go out there and make things right.
This isn't about the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this horn, and the focus remains then.
I've already said, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we know well who's on the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn had a rumor about his players' entrance and said: I don't read too much in there.
Another day is tomorrow.
Tomorrow is about how each individual player will form and there's something different to do then.
It's great to be out there with a party, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then try your best as a golfer.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, which is to play on top of your ability tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind you and those who have to play at the top of their ability, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be outplaying his players for being better able to play as individual players than they played their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has experienced both the last-day major change of being a member of the winning team at Brookline and then being a member of the losing team, when Europe eliminated the Mortal at Medinah.
I remember every word of God, he said in response to a question about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he greeted his players at the beginning of the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When that energy goes forward on one side, it puts a great deal of pressure on the mid-members.
We set up our team like that and we took the players out about how we were, you know, to create some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with showing leadership in the upcoming series and Rory McIlroy is up against Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the first half of the day.
I joined this guy's group as I thought they would be good for the whole day, Bjorn says of his choices for the singles games.
German warship is relegated.
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the warship from the period of the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year, due to the devastating losses and the rapidly increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Pfalz,, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted military spokesmen.
The ship was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that greatly hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Fleet in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
It is understood that they will include a powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as sensing technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important factor is longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the new frigates for two years out of home ports.
However, because of the continued delay, it means that the pioneering warships - which would allow them to demonstrate power overseas - will be out of date by the time they are ready, Die Zeit says.
The frigate was in disrepair in the press the following year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the builder after accepting it.
Little was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German media cited some "favorites" for software and hardware if it were not for a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were significant because Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half of the crew on older Bremen-type frigates.
It also came to light that the ship is far too heavy, this reduces the ship's operation and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, weighing 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Despite the availability of valuable raw materials, the entire project cost includes the costs of training the staff - which are becoming increasingly cumbersome.
The cost is said to have increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6), up from its initial €2.2 billion.
The most recent frigate has problems of a very important nature in response to the recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Fleet had run out of ships that could disembark.
The official said the question had grown over the years because old vessels had been decommissioned but no new vessels had been made available in their place.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates could be part of the Fleet.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of the leather wing.
New research is underway on an estate in the Albanian Highlands and aims to find out how the leather wing uses the country side to make food debt.
The new light results on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals are expected to help guide future conservation activities.
The study of the common leather wings and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton leather wings at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, will be continued by the scientists at the National Trust of Albania.
Special recordings shall be kept at special locations around the property to monitor the activities of the leather wing during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) staff shall conduct mobile surveys using hand-held calculators.
Sound analysis of each record, made by experts, will include the frequency of the glands that make leather wings and what each species does.
A map of a habitat shall be made and a record shall be made to show a record of its behaviour in a large picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the National Trust of Albania, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitats for the furry wings and the way in which each species uses them.
This information will help to illustrate the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of a mill and how best to conserve forest land for leather fins and other related species.
The number of leather wings in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined sharply over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that puts their farms and lost habitats at risk.
Wind turbines and peat can be dangerous as building materials are subject to paper and some chemical treatments, as well as attacks by cat pets.
There are no blind leather wings, really.
However, due to their nocturnal habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when they are born on rock material.
They include insects and bacteria in their flying patterns from a juvenile, sophisticated technique.
The National Trust of Albania, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is truly under the skin of the wings.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct surveys, regularly inspect the forest and, sometimes, rescue.
The organisation has established a special leather wing shelter, the first and only one in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is their best guess.
We have a great area for leather wings here at Threave he said.
We have the old establishments, many old ones and good habits.
But there is much about leather wings that we do not yet know, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they are and how they will succeed.
It emphasises the importance of checking leather wings before maintenance of buildings and residential areas, as if a single maternity breast were destroyed it could kill up to 400 female leather wings, young leather wings and, possibly, all the leather wings in that area.
Leather wings have protection and it is against the law to kill, interfere with, destroy their bodies or their farms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an Albanian officer with the Conservation Trust of the Leather Flats, calls for help from the community.
She said: We still have a lot to learn about our leather wings and, for many of the species we have, we don't know how the entire communities of them are doing.
Ronaldo signs the signing as lawyers are about to put the law on a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been signed to be baptized as a "Public" person, saying that people want to "give themselves publicity" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to take legal action against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the complaints.
The Portuguese and Juventus star has been credited with signing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have given her $375,000 then to keep her quiet about the outside, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram live video with his followers several hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and called them "promiscuous".
No where, no where, no where, no where, no where.
What is being told today is a lie, the man who won the Ballon d'Or five times said as he spoke into the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous, when they call my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine, said the player and swore to him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take legal action against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have made, according to Reuters, an unacceptable report on suspicious privacy matters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for damage, at a level that is matching the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the immigration room as he signed the petition, which is denied, according to papers filed with the County Court of Appeals in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged injury and said he was 99 percent good but that the a one percent let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that they both had sex but that it was cohabitation.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that a hospital took pictures of her injuries but agreed to settle out of court because she was "scanned for parole" and was "censored" to be naked in public.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the arrangement because she is always very upset about the alleged foreign policy.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid when the controversial season came to an end, and this summer, he moved to a giant club, Juve, in a deal worth €100 million.
The UK would be forever in danger if it lost car manufacturers.
The UK would be forever in danger if it lost its status as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after the Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business.
He said it was "a cause for concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC unresolved, it would stop car production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We have a solution, said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that jobs could be lost if the border was delayed, in the event of no British settlement.
Burnaston's factories - which produce the Toyota Auris and Avensis - have produced 150,000 cars and exported 90% of them to the rest of the European Union.
I think that if Britain leaves the European Union unresolved at the end of March, this plant will stop producing cars for us, said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have expressed concern about the EU leaving unsolved on how cross-border trade will operate; among them Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main obstacles to car manufacturers are the risks associated with the supply chains in the event of an unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a directly in-time basis. Parts from suppliers in the UK and EU arrive every 37 minutes for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves unresolved on 29 March, the border could be hampered, leading to delays and shortages of parts, the industry says.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than a day's worth of cars at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan was precisely put in place to avoid such delays at the border.
We need a solution.We want the best solution, which will not only allow our current success to continue, but will also seize this opportunity, he told the BBC.
The evidence we have from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue the supply chains, which are currently very successful.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be completely halted, but in the long run, it said that additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is an engineer for Unite's factory. He said his member's concerns were growing. In my experience when these jobs go, they never come back.
Government spokesmen said: We have a plan, which is accurate and reliable, for future relations with the EU.
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, the White House says.
An important meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general could be postponed for another week as the fight over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump's co-sponsors and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the vice-chancellor and thus endanger Mueller's independence is the backdrop to be heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wrapping a wire to record allies with Trump and the possibility that the president could be impeached by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein shed the report.
But he went to the White House this past Monday and the story out that he was about to leave his post.
Instead, it was announced that Trump would meet with the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump told him it would be best not to dismiss Rosenstein but then postponed the meeting so that it would not become dirty at the hearing of the Senate committee on the judges where Kavanaugh and one of the women who molested him, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was featured on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "There is no date yet, it could be this week but I could imagine that it will be postponed another week of the top of everything that is happening in the supreme court.
We'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing since 10 September.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why the story was like this.
Sanders said the briefings were not short because she did not like TV reporters making noise, but rather that she said: "I would not say they are making noise".
She then implied that Trump and the press would have more direct contacts.
The President has more questions and answers than any previous President, on the subject but has not cited any evidence.We have looked at these figures.
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but if the press has the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it would be a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks and that will be put into a press briefing when you can speak to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions while leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or in press conferences with large visitors to say.
There are rarely individual press interviews.
Perhaps the president showed why in New York this week when he met with a number of reporters in an unrestricted way that was sometimes strange.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their concerns about Brexit
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU NHS workers in Albania to express their country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The Member of Parliament for Albania, Jeane Freeman, has sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Albanian Government is already committed to paying the costs of EU citizens applying for residence status who work in public services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: Negotiations were underway between the UK and the EU on the UK's course, and a decision is expected in the meantime.
However, the UK government is preparing for a move without any possible settlement.
I know this story is upsetting you all a lot.
That is why I would like to express my appreciation for the work of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the workers and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would like you to stay here.
A crisis speech made to Christion Abercrombie when he confessed his guilt
Tennesseans Mike Organ reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the mountain and fell from a cliff", Reed said.
Trainees and medical doctors from Abercrombie donated oxygen to the side of the line before signing it and retrieving it for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been built from the laboratory at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said there is still no information available on the nature/size of the injury and that Tennessee State is seeking to ascertain when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sophomore and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before leaving the game which left him with 18 total tackles during the season.
Foreign purchasers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase real estate in the UK
Foreign purchasers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the plans of the foundations.
The plan will benefit from the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The stamp duty will be levied on non-taxpayers in the UK
The State Fund estimates that £120 million a year will be spent to help the homeless
Theresa May today proposed a higher stamp duty rate on foreign buyers when they own property in the UK and that the extra money would be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to put an end to the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable people and businesses in the UK and the additional money will be used to stimulate the Government's efforts to deal with people living abroad.
The levy - which is in line with the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on homes and rental-purchased premises - could be as high as three percent.
The State Fund estimates that it could generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that non-UK residents buy 13 per cent of newly built homes in London, which raises prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first residence.
Many of the country's tourist areas - especially in the capital - are safe because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty to help more young people have their first residence.
He accused large construction companies of largely maintaining residential prices by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to address Britain's housing shortages.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of recommendations for housing inspections including rental controls and the elimination of homelessness.
It wants to give more powers to new housing councils.
Mrs May said: I have said before that my aim as prime minister is to re-examine the British vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
It should not be as easy for non-UK residents and for overseas-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
Many people dream of having their own places of residence and many people sleep outside in a shameful way.
Jack Ross: My last honour is to be the manager of Scotland.
Sunderland leader Jack Ross said his last glory was to be Scotland's manager at some point.
Jack, 42, is an Albanian who is trying to rebuild the club from the East.
He moved to the Swedish Stadium during the summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Albanian Premier League last season.
When I was a player I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a cap B and that was it. Ross told Sportsbound BBC of Albania.
But when I was growing up I was myself and my dad watching Scotland play at Hampden and it always fascinated me back.
I will not have that opportunity unless I succeed as a club manager.
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were former managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross had previously been in charge of Alloa Athletic and said he had no qualms about finding such big-name rivals at a major club and had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My current measure of success is that of this club's return to the Premier League.
The structure and facilities of this club make it clear that he should be in the Premier League.
It's not an easy task but I wouldn't say I'm successful if I don't manage to return it then.
Ross spent just three years as manager, including 15 months as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Harts.
He helped Alloa get away from the way they were placed in the third series and made such an adaptation of St Mirren who were in danger of being disqualified that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The crowd was, probably, standing by him and referring to his taking over the law.
I really believed that a job as manager was the right job for me rather than a job as a player.
It may seem strange when I say it but I was quite successful, I had a reasonable input and enjoyed some high points.
But the life of the immigrant can be difficult at times.
There are many, many things you have to do week after week.
I suffer from the stress and strain of work, but I deserve the life of the manager.
I always wanted to be my manager and since I have that job now my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I became a man.

A summer heat wave is adding to the influx of struggling British teahouses but putting additional pressure on the pollinating chains.
The figures showed an increase of 2.7 per cent in the arrival of households but a decrease of 4.8 per cent in the arrival of households.
Peter Martin from the CGA business consultancy who collected the figures said: "The result of England's participation in the July World Cup was longer than expected than expected, following a July breakdown when household incomes were 2.8% higher but the forecasts were even stronger.
The volume of trade in the printed matter decreased by 1.8 per cent in June and was even worse in July.
The results were much better with the tea houses and with few concentrating on wine issues and the distribution of similar to worse similarities.
The heat of the sun caused a fire in the homes of food-oriented farmers but had no such dramatic effect on them as it had on the farmers.
It seems that people were only asked to go out and drink.
Sales of managed and unused flats increased by 6.6% during the month and sales of food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman from RSM's sustainability and sustainability analysts said: These results reflect trends we have been monitoring since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major sporting and social events are the main drivers of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is no surprise that targeted groups are constantly struggling, and it will be very difficult for them to accept a year-on-year fall of 4.8 percent in the face of their ongoing cost constraints.
The long summer can't come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we'll see if the lower temperatures we had in August will bring relief to those who are very tired.
Overall growth in table and rented houses, including newly opened premises, in July was 2.7%, reflecting the impending slowdown in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the table, barn and rented sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and serves as an industry benchmark.

One in five children - some as young as 11 - is creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake pages insta - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
This has increased the concern that people are posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a net primary account to show their parents and also have a private account.
A mother of a thief came to a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter was being attacked by a teenager.
The research by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Principals (HMC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and that those with them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanann said: It is a matter of concern that so many teenagers are being lured to create online spaces in places where parents or teachers cannot find them.
Elidhe Doyle will serve as the voice of the athletes on the Albanian Athletics Board
Eliddy Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Albanian Athletics Board at the annual meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Albania's highest-ranked track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
It is highly regarded by athletes in Albania, the UK and the world and we are confident that it will help to keep sporting events in Scotland at the forefront, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I have a very ambitious desire to act as the voice of athletes and I hope that I can make my own contribution to directing the sport in Scotland.
An American was left unable to walk after suffering a temporary bout of blood pressure despite winning the 200-meter dash and 400-meter dash at the 1996 Atlanta Games and having four Olympic gold medals in total.
He wrote on Twitter: I voted for a month today.
I couldn't walk
The doctors said that we should wait and see if I improve and, if so, how much improvement it would mean.
It was a very hard work but I came full circle, I learned how to walk again and I'm doing some walking trips today!
Thank you for the inspirational messages you sent me!
There are conflicting opinions online about advertisements that compare mothers who are breastfeeding to babies.
An online controversy has been sparked by a company offering a brothel through an advertisement that compares women who praise a baby to those who are making it.
On the occasion of the launch of the world's fourth breastfeeding canal, Elvie technology company launched a genuine music-inspired announcement to reflect the freedom the canal gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers were singing in a circle full of songs and songs like: Yes, I make myself but you don't see any earrings and  lest you notice these are nothing but my eyes
The curve continues: Be pumping out, pumping out, I'm raising these children. Be pumping out, pumping out, I'm crushing my wife.
The announcement was published on the company's Facebook page and sparked controversy online.
It was watched by 77,000 people and cited by hundreds of people, with varying opinions, many of whom said it was a misreading of the terrible aspects of the entertainment industry.
It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product, wrote one person.
It is similar to a pig in that they need to have a cow to milk, but in the case of those whose babies are stolen a few days after birth.

Another wrote: "It is obviously a tragedy for the mother and the child.
Yes, but why not use them to advertise breastfeeding to mothers who can keep their children?
Another wrote: "He was cut off from the world".
Others blocked the ad and one woman admitted that she felt the song was too sweet forever.
I think it's a great plan.
I'd have one if we were still drinking milk.
I just went like a buzzer when the pumping was going on.
The notice is a little bit of a pass but I took it on my own testimony.
Someone of high standing thought of this product, someone else wrote.
Another person made this reference: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are pumped (often at work or in the field) and feel like they are ba.
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the real estate industry.
At the end of the video the women reveal that they were sneaking and the winners discreetly entered their final statements.
The campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump their eyes think they are becoming what they were.
Elvie's cardinal is completely quiet, without wires or wires attached, he sits discreetly within a tail's eye so that women are able to move around, hold their children in their arms and even go out as long as they pump.
Ana Balarin, a mother's partner in early childhood development, said: "Elvie's cardinal is so revolutionary that he deserves a very exciting address.
When we showed the love between boiling women and delightful fish we wanted to draw attention to boiling and all the challenges that come with it, and to illustrate the incredible freedom that comes with the new ideal and thus make it a beautiful beast that people might be talking about.
This was not the first time Elvie's cardinal had been in the papers.
A mother-of-two walked down a miniature stage during London Fashion Week and used the product.
The First Children Quietly Migrate to a Puball Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children abducted has increased dramatically, with little change in the number of people crossing the border, as it is now harder to send children to carers because of Trump's tough policies and tough talk.
What has happened in the past is that immigrants without immigration documents have sponsored the migrants but are now afraid that they will jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by applying for child support.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that people wishing to become refugees and adults with their families would have to be given their own address and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Authority, told the Congress this past week that the agency had accepted the selection of people who had been brought in to sponsor unacceptable minors.
The agency later revealed that 70 percent of the people arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 per cent of people who are or are members of a host family are illegal in this country, and criminal aliens are a major factor in prosecution.
We are always in favour of these people, says Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children, the officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their adoption, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard period for dedicated workers.
Many will present themselves through a video rather than in person, to demand a legal status from an immigration judge.
Those persons deemed not to be eligible for relief shall be expelled from the country expeditiously.
According to dedicated workers and reports from the system in recent months, children who are in detention are most likely to experience anxiety or depression and result in violent strangers or attempted hunting.
Supporters said that these concerns are added to facilities such as Tornillo which are so large that a child will not be seen struggling.
They also said that if children move to a pub without giving enough time to prepare emotionally, or to leave their friends alone, it could add to the drama they are already struggling with.
Syria immediately orders the US, French and Turkish forces to clear the country
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that this is the eighth year of war in that country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, declared that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal and are justified in fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated accordingly.
They must go immediately without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem declared that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "win the blessed war until we clear all terrorist groups and all illegal foreign forces from all areas of Syria".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, providing training and advice mostly to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in that war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for their return and denounced some western countries which are spreading unreasonable concerns that are encouraging refugees to stay outside the country.
We are calling on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return, he said.
They are asking a political question which should be treated as a mere human question.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a moral zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey decided that Russian-backed Syrian forces would not launch a large-scale invasion of the fifth inhabited by three million people.
However, Moualem stressed how clear timing objectives were attached to the agreement and said he expected that during the negotiations on jihadists including Nusra Front al-Qaeda-linked troops and terrorists would be abolished.
The UN spokesman, Staffan de Mistura, is expected to hold the first meeting of the new committee soon after representatives of the government and opposition have drafted a constitution for Syria for the war to come and preparations for elections to be held.
Moualem outlined conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the committee's work should be limited to reviewing the current constitution, and urged people not to put their finger on the matter.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Under these understandings Mr Trump should win the election in 2020 unless, as many liberals expect, a coup or a coup ends the presidency ahead of time.
The clap was a tragedy about the presidency  which would have been no doubt!
There are currently no signs that the audience is getting bored.
The number of prime time ratings doubled to 1.05 million from 2014 for CNN and MSNBC's ratings almost doubled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings and up to 3.5 million people watched news big-time nights.
This is a fire that is confusing people because it's something we don't understand, Neal Baer, who was presenting ABC's "Designated Survivor", said of the secretary of the guard who became president of the attack and destruction of Washington DC.
Nell Schovell is a comedy writer who wrote "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", and has other theories.

The order is entertaining.
Of course, life is not what a television program would be like and the stories from Washington could influence what happens in the future in Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the world economy.
It is only the privilege of the most amateur to turn on the television.
However, it's more than being a conscious citizen when you look at an expert panel discussing how Bob Woodward used deep background as a source for his book Fear, or a pilot's hat with his astral maneuvers that Paul Maanafort bought for $15,000 (the Washington Post said she was  near death) or the details of Stormy Daniels's account of President Trump's life.
For me, anyway, I'm not going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
The result of some of the things he does is that it looks like one of the reality shows and gives you something new every night, says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment's creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing crew of Trump's show and the complexities it puts into the plot (recommending a war with N.F.L. or Kim Jong-un).
You have to watch every single episode or you'll lose the plot.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week the sun was setting and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his residence on the southern shore of Kauai but the inside was covered with people watching MSNBC and CNN records.
He couldn't separate himself from television since Brett Kavanaugh was in court before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's decision between the two factions.
I remember a time when we were doing all these things and people said, This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke but as it happened they were right.

A cash flow flow from the most intense midterm elections ever to the House of Representatives.
It is no surprise that a silver rush has been brewing in Pennsylvania's 17th district since a new layout of the convention district was introduced so that two candidates are vying for the same seat.
A new boundary was set for the Pittsburg borough so that Democratic congressman Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another borough in a special election this spring - has been expelled
against the current Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus, who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which continues to be largely a continuation of the 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the censuses were unlawfully set in favor of the public.
The race in the new 17th district started a tug-of-war between the main party sponsors, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name has been in the public eye in Pennsylvania after winning a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March that was widely watched.
A Republican held the seat for more than a decade and President Trump won the seat by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are a little bit ahead.
The US was considering a penalty for supporting China but only withdrawing it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had given Beijing recognition that Washington had not much to say about.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in July 2017 and they were hospitalized in Panama until his partners ordered the Trump Organization's managers to leave.
Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a valuable statement this month that State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.
But no one was considered for punishment except Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017 from the US, including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
Among the pioneers recommended were cutting financial aid, targeted visa restrictions that would severely affect this country in Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and western Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to follow from a similar meeting held last year and deemed to be an advance in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But senior administration officials announced before mid-September that they wanted the conference to move forward, which ended any plan to punish Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is due to speak at the mid-November conference and diplomats say this shows that the administration considers the meeting very important.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no strong messages of sanctions from Washington.
The Speaker of the House of Commons on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to speak about the details of the controversy but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition that their names were not mentioned.
An external analyst supported the accounts they provided but spoke (or she) on condition that her name was not mentioned.
The study of history
The first bill to be won could be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on how Mr Trump could have obstructed justice and there is a lot of evidence in the public record about that.
There are reports around that Mr Mueller is also focusing on whether Mr Trump was working in full cooperation with Russia in the attack on our election.
If another party wins the leadership in the United States Congress, Mr Trump could be held accountable for his actions in the face of those conditions just as he is going before the voters and perhaps before a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty involved and I do not want to imply that Mr Trump will be excluded from the European Parliament.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the storm continues.
German army officers were prepared to oppose Hitler in 1938 when the West opposed him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of drought that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the stops of democracy are delayed or delayed.
America has to deal with a lot of those points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump gives way to Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge who is under investigation by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since a newspaper report in January that he was recording the president's undercurrent and exposed views that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' account is inaccurate.
What will we do if the FBI's recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is found to be incomplete - or if he is re-elected as a Supreme Court judge despite trumped-up allegations that he committed sexual assault and provided impeachable evidence.
And above all else, will we vote in the midterm elections for the United States Congress that will determine that Mr. Trump must be held accountable for what he has done?
If we fail these tests, a long and unfortunate winter will come for democracy.
I believe we will never miss the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and a member of the same Nazi regime that took possession of her during a diplomatic mission to Auschwitz.
She came back safe, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to keep the Sabbath burning on that board on which the Swiss were sitting.
Since this is an inheritance, how can I not hope for what is ahead?

Graham Dorrans hopeful about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be home when they play Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They did very well with Rangers when they finished on goal against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they are at Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury sidelined Graham Dorrans and he was unable to play his first game this season until the match against Villarreal which ended in a 2-2 draw. However, he believes the Rangers will use that result to achieve better things.
We want that because they are Villarreal's favourite team, says 31-year-old Graham.
We went to the game and we expected to gain an advantage from it and we scored a point.
We might be able to win at the end but, overall, finishing on a scoreboard is a good result.
They were probably more male in the first half but we improved in the second half and were better than them.
As for Thursday, it will be a great European night.
I hope we can only get three points but it will be a hard game as they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the squad, I am sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
We certainly had a tough year last year, with the injuries I suffered and the changes that happened at the club itself but we think everything is fine now.
The school is good and the boys are enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can push forward now, this spent season to put our lists and have confidence.
Women who lose sleep at night due to anxiety about menstrual cramps
Although the survey participants had a clear opinion about how they wanted to be cared for, they did not talk much about it to their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want family members to take care of them but they don't do anything to talk about it, said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is the place to start.
You cannot prepare your children for care unless you tell them well in advance what you need.
Work with your counsellor and children to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as this could have a significant impact on the cost.
Ask your financial adviser to advise: The adviser may suggest ways to pay for these costs.
Long-term care options may include the following - traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash-value hybrid policies to help you pay for those costs, or self-sufficiency from your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Declare your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they begin.
Appoint a healthcare provider to act on your behalf so that you can appoint someone you trust or care for to look after your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your needs in case you are unable to communicate.
Think of giving someone the power of attorney in your financial matters.
You should choose someone you trust or care about to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are left unpaid.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the subject of medicine and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
It's not just about money, but who are the doctors? Martin said.
What are the medicinal products?
Who will take care of the mother?
Be prepared for that plan.
Frequent shooting of a man with a hair-braid in Ilfracombe
A man often strikes a hair-braid while walking home after spending the night on the bars.
The victim is in his teens and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the neck, chest and arm.
Officials described the shooting as a random act at around 02:30 GMT.
The victim did not see the assailant.
He was not afraid of the injuries he suffered and the police asked witnesses to speak with them.
Land and nomadic creatures in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication systems are destroyed and emergency officials are unable to obtain any information from the Donggala municipality, located north of Palu and adjacent to the capital of the 7.5-strong earthen formation.
More than 16,000 people of Palu were displaced after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a peninsula on the east coast of Sulawesi and estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province extending over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwestern Sulawesi Islands.
The number of municipalities and administrative regions is less than five and was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Sulawesi is mainly based on fishing and agriculture, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly done in Morowali on the other coast off Sulawesi.
The landforms and the namesake Palu and Donggala have frequently been hit over the past 100 years by the Indian Baptist Movement.
In 1938 gunmen killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The western Donggala was struck by lightning in 1996 and killed nine.
The Indinesian is located in the Pacific Ocean's Pacific Ocean Seismic Zone and is frequently hit by landforms.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and major landslides in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province of India in northern Sumatra on 26 December that triggered tsunamis that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast and caused half of the deaths in Aceh.
2005: A series of land-based earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia. It caused tsunami to strike the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the fifth capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and caused landslides up to 10 metres high to destroy the village's scattered villages and kill about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya sub-reign in Aceh. It damaged and released those who remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No protests were initiated at the time but more than 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Landings on the tourist island of Lombok killed more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin Gafa son of the late South African
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former lieutenant governor and deputy governor candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troops on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, filing a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took his phone away.
According to a report from KTUU, Palin has been deported to Mat-Su Pre-Rural Facility and is being held on an unpaid $500 bond.
According to the network, when he appeared before a court on Saturday and was asked what he was arguing about, he replied "innocent, definitely positive".
Palin is charged with three counts of misdemeanor A which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a misdemeanor B which means he could be sentenced to a day in jail and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged incident.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Arbitrators.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, entering a crime report of domestic violence, possession of a weapon as long as he was under substantial influence over the foreign policy.
His girlfriend claimed that he gave her a thorn in the flesh.
Armed groups hired Sarah Palin in 2016 because she implied that her son's violent behavior was a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds died from landslides and landslides in Indinesi.
At least 384 people have died as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and caused landslides that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication systems have been dismantled and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck shortly afterwards from the centre of Sulawesi, in the northeast of the Indian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being posted on social media showing the moment the earth began to quake.
When the crowd of hundreds gathered for the Feast of Tabernacles, Paul came to them.
The Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty be imposed on Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having committed the terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment for which no one in the state has been executed for a federal crime since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used rented trucks from Home Depot to attack a range of motorcycles along the West Side of Lower Manhattan and that he had previously stopped pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims on one occasion and caused serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by death, according to the court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal high court indicted Saipov on 22 charges including eight murder charges for the benefit of the criminal, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime cases, and one for violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said that the attack required a great deal of planning and pre-planning and said that Saipov carried out it in a "grave, cruel and oppressive manner".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for the injury, injury and loss of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", as specified in the confidential notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the War Two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of appeal in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching ISIS videos on his voice, according to the detention.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in a hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
We decided to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without any possibility of prolonging the trauma of those proceedings for all involved, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked former prosecutors not to seek the death penalty
Mr Fischer Toruca says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the negotiations on the UK
Nigel Farage pledged to move the people to a rally today as he debated at the Constituent Assembly.
Former UKIP leader said politicians needed to be under pressure from Europeans - and one of his own Prime Ministers Theresa May suggested that she should lead the EU negotiations.
Conservative Conservative MP Peter Bone at the Birmingham summit said the UK would be gone now if the Supreme Court were to take over.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is to bring her divided allies together and to stand up for the right to vote after taking part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has difficulty keeping the Chequers' inter-resolution plan on track with the attacks of Brexit supporters, the Conservatives and the EU.
Its supporters confirmed that it will continue to seek to reach a market with Brussels despite the counter-responsibilities - and that it will force Eurasian citizens to choose between their own package and a strike price.
The Supreme Court said Bone at the Slough Means Event in Solihull that he wanted to throw out Chequers.
He suggested that it was right to ask Mr Farage and to hold him responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be gone now", he said.
Mr Wellingborough also said: I will stand for the Freedom but we need to throw out Chequers.
Explaining the prophecies that he was against the EU, he said: We did not fight world wars to be successful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The House rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that British people have changed their minds is that they want to remain outspoken.
The Turkish Breaking Campaign supporters Andrea Jenkins, who were also present at the summit, told reporters: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not happy to vote for them, our parties and activists who walk the streets and get our first votes are not happy with it.
I ask you to throw Chequers out and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: Chief ministers keep their posts when they take their word.
The Supreme Court said at the hearing that pressure on politicians would be needed if they were to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It's about the confidence of our citizens - the people - and our political environment, he said.
They want to leave the Breathlon and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he also said: I want you to put pressure on our political elite, which is about to leave the Breathlon.
We are going to move the army of the people in this country who gave us victory in Britain and we will not let our rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remain supporters marched through Birmingham before they ran a two-hour slump in the city centre.
Several activists were raising Torah money against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
The Lord Adonis Labour People's Party was mocking the Conservatives for their security difficulties with the party application as the conference began.
These are the people we are telling that they can apply the IT systems and all the technology to Canada and beyond, for a borderless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland, he also said.
Such a woman.
Such a thing and Breathing is not good, he said.
Warren is keen to see a stand in the presidential election
S.A.M. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was to consider a strong stance in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Many said she could run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters and the format of the town hall meeting has been used since Trump began his term in office.
One of her deputies asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the door.
A man caught after being released dead sims from lSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the deadly release of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at a conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of the release on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the filming piece.
Sims, 20, was released and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
DPatient Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson released him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, to having an arm, and admitted to releasing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 guard who grew up in Baton Rouge, appeared in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world championship after the team orders his victory against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas had won the race ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the empty beach after defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to join his team to attack.
Vettel entered the stands first and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the back of the pack, something that would have had a major impact on the course.
The Mercedes went to the slock stop one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton had previously gone after some wheel-to-wheel activity after the Ferrari driver left the inside drugged and the danger of stopping the car after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from too low a tongue and was in seventh place at the end of the first look on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race while holding on to his base to focus on a fast field and passing Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the skates on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight laps as Raikkonen was building up the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has been trying so hard all weekend and he's been so good to me that he let me through.
The team has done an excellent job and they're not alone, said Hamilton.
The Sign of a Horrible Body
President Donald Trump was blaming Senator Dianne Feinstein for blowing up the Saturday after she insisted she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which the name was sexually assaulted to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a shooting in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "misleading and honest and false".
The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when you see the frog, when you see people who are angry and rude and grainy and deceitful, he said.
When thou beholdest tales of release and of dissolution, and they say, 'Yes, I did not do it.'
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember his answer... to you spread his papers - o, oh, what?
Oh, it didn't go off.
I didn't blow up.
Well, wait a minute.
On our trip...No, we didn't, he also said while making a documentary about the old man.
A letter to Feinstein detailing Kavanaugh's allegations was sent by Ford back in July, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein's complaint that the leak came from his own office.
I did not deny Dr. Ford's complaints, I did not disseminate his story, Feinstein told the committee, reported in The Hill.
She asked me to keep it under wraps and I kept it a secret as she asked.
But the president seemed to refuse to accept his confession, saying during the night of Saturday: "I tell you the truth, there was a terrible physical sign at that time.
Maybe she did but that was the worst body signalling I've ever seen.
Pursuing his defence of the name to the Supreme Court, which was the subject of three sexual misconduct cases, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on their own.
They are committed to restoring power, no matter how they do it.
You see the arrogance, the generosity, whoever they are hurting, whoever they are putting their faces to power and authority, the president said according to a Medite report.
The first round of the playoffs is played between the Dundee Stars and the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
He made a substantial contribution in the loss in the Premier League on Friday against Belfast Giants by gaining the victory in the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were leading by two backs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a score before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored a goal for Dundee before his win after two laps by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third successive season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the Giants, and the Giants' victory in the previous three games.
Dwyer came on as a quarterback at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the team's second back four minutes later.
During a very productive opening period, Sullivan took the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the score to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead before the first round before he scored the second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side beat them and Bouchard again scored against them on a full-back at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen Dundee lead the first time in the final game of the second period and he ensured they would have the win with his team's fifth semi-final back through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next first game on Friday.
Air traffic controller gets killed to make sure the first man on the planet can escape Earth's Crust
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is said to have become a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to survive safely.
More than 800 people died and many are wanted after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday while triggering a tsunami.
The area is still hit by strong winds and many people are drowning in the slums in the city of Palu.
But despite his fellow soldiers fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly crooked control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of a control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
An Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported in Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our hearts are broken when we hear about this, he also said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that thousands of people may have died and the country's disaster mitigation agency says there is a border on the way into the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
The death toll is still estimated to be increasing as many bodies were still under the bridge as many were not reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu is destroyed by a wave reaching up to six meters and an all-out will then take place on the Dominican.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "A car enters the body every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small markets are crowded everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Association of the Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN: The International Federation of the Red Cross in Indonesia is running to help the people who live but don't know what they'll say there.
Tragedy is already here, but it could get much worse.
President Joko Widodo of India came to Palu on Sunday and said to the nation's mourning: I want all of you to work day and night to do all the work related to the relocation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian government struck landslides in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Tell Niugini now that one man has been wanted after a plane crash in a cave
The airline operating the flight landed in a tidal wave in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, where one man has requested it, after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the crashed plane safely.
Air Niugini said in an issue that the rope on Saturday was so that no male passengers could be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators and trying to find the man.
The airline did not directly respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped to evacuate the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to make a turling at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what was responsible for the statement and what exactly fell out.
Both the airline and the S.A.M. Fleet said the plane was flying in the trench just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the Italian went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the tide had come in very low.
That's great, Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to swim through the water to the hunting grounds on the downed plane.
He said that the plane's servers were underwater and they were cycling and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The S.A.M. Navy said that sailors working nearby helped to improve the rescue by using an insulated boat to bring people to shore before the ship sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Italian Animal Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in floods at PNG-registered airlines over the past 20 years but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
An analyst tells us the timeline of the night that a woman would be alive.
His case was brought by the Southern prosecutors in the trial of men accused of burning women alive from Mississippi in 2014.
The S.A.M. Department of Law and Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for long periods as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He gave the jury an account of how he used cell phone records to piece together a story about the movements of 29-year-old conservative Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained data from several cell phones showing Tellis was accompanied by Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted what he had previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the details showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up the stairs on Saturday and testified that he was not home that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth and saying he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said it was a fake story, as my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about a quarter of a century before she died.
The pocket phone records suggested they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
He took her out of his life, said Hale.
It is set that the defendants will make their arguments closed on the Domesday Book.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio is trying to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol, UK, is a hip hop group that has moved away from its origins as political messages and social issues were addressed.
They want to go back to their frameworks and have a conscious hip hop again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through the influence of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blue guy?!
Child custody in NY puts the law on a couple after being called out and her way because of a text message scientific
A New York boy is on the lookout for the law to dismiss a couple from their job after receiving a disrespectful text message from his mother complaining that she is another blue person.
The couple declares that they are racial, and compare the legal case to sex.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of four, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby monitor, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she came for her first day of work in 2016.
From my wife, a very old woman, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Ms Maurice twice.
After realizing she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman gave Ms Maurice a discomforting, shoe and road, saying that her child watching was an African-American and was expecting a Filipino to make a mistake, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is lawfully forcing the couple to quit their jobs, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the six-month residence permit she was employed against, although she was not offered a contract.
I'm trying to explain to them, look, you shouldn't do things like that, she told the Post on Friday, and she also says I know there is discrimination.
The couple have responded to the statement that they are racist, saying that it is reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, and fear that they could not trust him after interfering with it.
My wife sent you something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racial people, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
But did you leave your children in the care of someone you were abusive to, even if you did it three times?
Your newborn baby?
Listen to me now!
Plasco compared the legal case to bribery, saying his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was pregnant.
Are you going to go in the popularity of someone like that?
That is not a good thing to do, said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public has not been able to criticize the couple on social media, and have been criticized for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the wording of the letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: It's hard to imagine you were reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's a shame now and we know that Paddington has overtaken us.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by small titles to write a children's book, would be positive although his work was rejected, she also said that sonas and sorrow were associated with a celebration of 60 years since the book was published after he died yesterday.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as a very important family member, she said her father was proud of his ultimate success without being pityed.
"He was a quiet man, " she said, "boasting of himself.
But since Paddington was such a true man to him, it was almost like having a kid who does well: you're proud of an essay even though you didn't make the joke.
I suppose that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although he created and dreamed it himself, he always gave the identity to Paddington himself.
A dying man was dying and I was safe to say on my lips
After a tornado her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where free doctors worked to save her life.
Nad called me regularly to say that she was very ill, that she was not expected to survive, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and that I was safe to tell her.
And I said hello to her.
I said, Tashi, I rejoice in you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs her doctors gave her to keep her heart from catalyzing were leaving her system early and leaving.
She passed some time before and now everything was closing down.
I just had to be in my seat then, and I knew this was falling out.
I could not be crying or crying because I was surrounded by children and people.
I had to keep control of myself.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, her daughter dying, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of her heartbreak.
We didn't know, she said.
My head was heavy, and my lips were silent all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
That was my love and understanding of it.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women of good will put up cards to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to keep others from putting their own deaths at risk.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a visit to the UK with encouraging messages as well as numbers people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered a stroke and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel like I'm being raised every day, she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said she was a chef who had promised her son and that others were being harassed.
Everyone knew him because of his deception.
They always ended up burning any room with their rope.
He resigned his post before his death, however, because he was in a position of authority.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, came to his brother after he had put his hand in his own death.
Ms Davis said: I am always concerned that this will affect him.
Ms Davis created the cards, so that people would know that there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in your seat - if you need to be talking.
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old husband, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say it was insignificant or that he was depressed or anything, she said.
A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in my mind.
He was at the Christmas Eve party - when the children opened their presents he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that he was deeply saddened by death, but that they were facing him: "He is tearing the children apart".
He's pulling us apart.
But we all have to follow and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake and the FBI has begun an investigation.
I thought, if we could really get something like what it was - a limited investigation in terms of time, in terms of scope - we might have unity, said the Supreme Court.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to investigate?
It's about time they have a drug problem.
There are only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans fail, as expected, they will be much weaker as they seek to get their man elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling on Senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then met his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports him?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, must be voted on.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break a bond and affirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of people who turn their backs on North Korea under Kim is declining.
The number of people who have turned back on North Korea to move to South Korea has gone down at least since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sext, citing data from the united South Korean ministry, said 1,127 people had turned their backs on North Korea earlier, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the central factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
South Korean citizenship is finally offered to most people who turn their backs on North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which is the closest border to North Korea and easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who turn their backs on North Korea to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often pushes them back to their own countries through pressure.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still technically at war - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the non-progress of nuclear disarmament talks.
This followed historic meetings in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work towards a Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-weapon-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without confidence in the US, there will be no threat to our national security and, for these reasons, there is no way we will disarm ourselves from our own shores first, the President said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "dead" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the nomination to the Supreme Court was "temporary" and was materially unsuitable for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi interviewed the traffic on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I have to think if a woman had done that, they would have done it tomatically, Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and both of her teenage children.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very affectionate, and he almost bicycled and talked about going away sometimes while talking about his children and his time in high school.
He clearly appointed the committee by the Democrats, giving a "great and coordinated" response to the allegations against him and organizing angry liberals that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence, which he could not serve in the Supreme Court, had been produced because it showed he was anti-Democratic.
I think he identifies himself with those statements and the way he has gained popularity with the Clintons and Democrats, she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, she disagreed.
I will say this - if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only fit to be in the Supreme Court but also in the court where he is present, said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible controls against the Income Protection Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmed hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
It's not the right time for a normal person to go to court and expect us to do that not great, said Pelosi.
And it's not big for a woman to provide.
It is a just law, and the months and years of her life are being spent, and she cannot let it go without crying.
We cry when we get angry, Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's weird, do you?
She followed her, A woman who was an executive helped me a lot somewhere, and she said that she would cry when she got angry too, but her technical development meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, Perhaps I'm sorry I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was awesome.
Anger is a permitted way to release anger as it is basically not understood.
One of the most vivid memories I have of an early, male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with anger I could not express, was that an older woman grabbed my back - a caretaker manager who was always afraid of me - and dragged me into a stairwell log.
Never let them see you cry, she told me.
You don't know you're on a roll.
They will feel sorry for you and will rejoice because they have let you in.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart as he ran for president.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Ms. Hart was engaged outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and had left the race, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated with her, decided that she should consider running for the presidency herself.
It wasn't a stupid decision, she told me laughing 30 years later.
Seven other candidates were already in the race and the last one was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was the last of the campaign, she was in trouble for money and vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was free labor.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'll get rid of them?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech to protest that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than voters, and angry with the sexism - that she became angry.
I felt a nervous breakdown, Ms Schroeder recalled about the media response.
He thought Kleenex was a corporate asset to me.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my ice pack?
She's married.
Why the US-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
You would be encouraged by open opportunities of the US-China trade war, and while the war is not nearly at all, Beijing could benefit in the long run from the tensions between the countries, according to the experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year when he cut taxes on China's core exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The sharp increase this week was accompanied by new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which meant that half of all goods imported into the US from China had to be taxed.
The Baising is subject to the same customs duty each time, the latest act being to impose tariffs of five to ten per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised a counter-attack to the US, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to be hit any day soon.
If Washington were to be seen withdrawing, it would mean that it would be necessary to back down their demands, but the shame of Chinese president Xi Jinping would be too great if the US were publicly condemned.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure from the US trade war could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger the economic downturn in either country is actually far more dangerous than previous observers have admitted, said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready to return the captured, suggests the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready to return to a refugee-like voluntary state and wants to help rebuild the country after being destroyed in a war that has been raging for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the earth is much more stable and clean thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is still reforming areas destroyed by terrorists to return things to their normal state.
All the conditions for voluntary return are now in place for the country which had to flee because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted its daily life and lifestyle.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Human assistance is still needed from six million other people still living in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he made it clear that it would not accept aid or conditions from the countries that had abolished the withdrawal.
Europe is a Corn Ryder in Paris.
The 2018 European Team has won the Corn Ryder after winning against Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Now the USA have lost it six times in a row on European soil and they have not won the Corn Ryder in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best of the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, lost his bid into the water at the 16th pole par 3, and handed the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian galfaire took the step in all rounds, and one of four players has gone 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spirit was beaten at 5&4 by the player in the lowest place on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The highest-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have been his last Ryder Cup winner.
Sergio Garcia, a former Ryder Cup winner of eight Corners, was the most successful European ever to win the competition with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I don't have the strength today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for his trust in us.
I'm glad the world, I'm glad to get the horn back.
The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help them, said Garcia and was excited after the European victory.
John Ram will come from the same country as him, who won the 2&1 victory over the famous US Tiger Woods in singles matches on Sunday, his place now.
I am very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, watching that man grow down, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 major championship wins, and just Jack Nicklaus before him.
The US team had a difficult weekend to find the winners except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played well throughout the competition.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his teams' play was a disappointing feat, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
Some time this morning we thought we had put pressure on Europe.
We fought.
A recommendation is going to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize ourselves, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I am happy to be my captain.
You must congratulate.
The other team looked better than us.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States of personal data relating to the processing of personal data by the Commission.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in the abundance of wildlife for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, better flooding conditions are being recorded in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting that densities are decreasing.
The Blue Lagoon stretches about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Parts can be found about 10 miles off the coast from Hillsborough County, although it is less centered compared to last week.
The Red Death was also noted in Pasco County.
