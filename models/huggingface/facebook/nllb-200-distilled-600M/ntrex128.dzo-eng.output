John Edward: Language skills for the international community
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained their best performance records in 2018, with excellent academic results, thanks to sports, engineering, and community support.
Scotland has over 30,000 students, and their schools are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association and focus on providing a high standard of education for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education and lifelong employment and to become international citizens.
As a constitutionally organized and applied academic community, modern languages are considered a desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak in a language that is understood, you will be a fool for a man".
If you speak in his tongue, you become a snare to him.
It is a reminder that we will not only use English to make peace with other countries.
Today, the top-ranked graduation rate in language classes is among the highest in the independent schools.
68% of foreign language learners have earned a degree in a given discipline.
In data from 74 schools of the Scottish Independent Schools Association, 72% of pupils achieved a top grade in Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This indicates that foreign language teaching in independent schools in Scotland is a key skill for students and young people in the future.
Languages are now considered a subject of choice in liberal arts and other institutions, as opposed to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
In a 2014 UK Labour and Skills Council study, 17% of labourers who failed to fill the vacancy were due to language skills deficiency.
The youths who are trained in language are taught to be ready for the future,
The number of opportunities for language skills is high, and language skills are one of the most important in the international community.
Choosing a second language is a great advantage in the future.
If a person who speaks a foreign language can communicate directly with a foreign person, he or she will naturally excel in competitions.
According to the UGV poll, in 2013, 75% of the 4,000 people in the UK were unable to communicate without knowing a foreign language, while only 15% spoke French.
That is why it is important to make efforts to teach children today to speak a language.
In contrast, in developing countries, children are more likely to be enslaved if there are more languages.
Scottish schools have a variety of teaching languages.
Some schools focus on older languages, while others focus on the UK by 2020, with key languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
Independent schools may choose languages according to your child's interests, and teachers are also experts in the language.
The education system in Scottish independent schools also focuses on providing children with future-proof skills.
In the global business environment, languages will remain important for the country's future, and this must be recognized and included in education.
Therefore, modern languages should be considered an international communication technology.
Independent schools will continue to provide Scottish youth with a wide range of options, opportunities and privileges.
Do this in your own way.

At Harvard, students are taught about rest.
A new study at Harvard University has suggested that students will have more time to sleep and that they will be more likely to read books without sleeping.
The university said that it was not a good idea to consider the top universities in the world.
Dr. Clary Sigler, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the Sisters Hospital, said the study was the first of its kind in the United States.
The initial inspiration for the lesson came after a sleeping instructor explained the harm of learning.
Finally, a second came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me about this only at the end of the year?
"I am amazed that no one has ever told anyone about this dream", she told him.
The class is a period beginning with the students being told about the benefits of good sleep from education and sports in general.
According to Paulet Charia, a psychologist and director of the Habat Medical School, the class decided to start the class after two students learned about their discomfort for a week.

Professor Perezser suggested that students should be kept awake and alert for the heat and the bright lights of technology and lights could cause sleep disturbances.
