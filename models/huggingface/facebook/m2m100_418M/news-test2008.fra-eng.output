Inflation has dropped food in Europe
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price rise, in the 13 countries of the euro area, was more significant than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office located in Luxembourg said.
The official forecasts showed only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the direct interest rate by saying that the decrease of interest, with the rise of raw materials prices and the decrease of unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent.
According to an analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: “We need to dissuade” inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has decreased due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The long-term cereal market rates have risen by 88 percent and the soya price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent but, in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate for 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the direct rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz (Young Democrats Alliance) supporters has increased significantly in early December. So since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Survey) has never previously found such a low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is 2% in the entire population.
On faithful voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who judged the country’s economic situation was severe has never been so high, it rises to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite severe.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population predicts an aggravation and only one tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
In December last year, 71% of the respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous surveys, found that the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent don’t trust the prime minister at all and 27 per cent don’t trust the Fidesz president at all.
One of the indicators of the change of political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be treated without government change.
While after the outbreaks last October, 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, the current rate is only 20 percent.
On the question about the intention of voting, 60 percent of the respondents answered that they would definitely go to vote and the 20 percent added said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would participate and 15 percent additional would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to the fees for higher education, 79 percent would say no to the consultation costs and 84 percent would say no to the hospitalization costs.
When we only look at the same proportions among the people who expressed their intention to vote for the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospitalization fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs trade triangleined the average price rise of 16 percent from last year, unlike this year the VAT rate did not rise.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Dayly Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent in average, a value increase significantly greater than a thousand forints appeared in all hypermarkets.
The prices, “which had already flown” in the major food stores in December last year, have no longer increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained almost the same as last year, but the prices of dwarf, nuts and pavot have increased significantly.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but at Auchan, we found bread from a kilogram to only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the product price below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
Unfortunately this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices have risen by 1 480 forints in average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process made trade confusing, the hypermarkets were unable to clearly determine what margin to apply to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks to lose a large profit on the margin suited to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the price increase of the daily basket evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than 1.630 forints than last year and the cheapest prices increased by 1.284 forints too.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items rose by more than 30 percent in the hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some first-need foods, the Statistical Institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with milk and eggs.)
According to the last’s daily basket, this seems almost absurd as the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has just increased by just more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to make the brutal price rise also accepted by multinational companies.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take foods of long conservation by palettes.
On Wednesday morning, major tails formed in the treasury’s three hypermarkets as the number of customers has grown suddenly.
But, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinational companies complain to survey companies not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals make savings on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mostly caused by misuse of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overload of medical staff don’t help block infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make the economy on disinfectants
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology service of the János Hospital.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wounded in a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after he had to return there due to a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do him an important operation due to the bacteria that is in his body.
Until December 10, this year, 1,094 hospitalized infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, otherwise staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of people are carryers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria well-resistant to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged dysfunction of the immune system, this bacteria can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicemia, on elderly, low-weight or weakened bodies.
According to the director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
The most important thing is not to confuse the infection with the epidemic, you don’t find MRSA only or you don’t look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
They are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the care staff put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are MRSA carriers, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
The sampling is not fashionable.
The vast majority of the infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable, in Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is mainly manifested in hospitals and resorts for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological removal is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases only occur if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the head doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the healing of certain infections and syndrome.
It is necessary to make efforts to target antibiotic therapy, otherwise, microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance but hospitals do not always take it into account.
The realization of microbiological screening is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
Therefore, it is essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, significant lacunes are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of drops and by contact. However, due to the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be distant from each other at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are observed, the number of infections is lower in a detrimental way or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Projects Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, so we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has set up a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The victim of a deadly accident was not drunk.
The official constatation of the deadly accident caused by the commissary of the 22nd district was drawn up.
It can be excluded that the commissary of the 22nd district, who has since resigned from his position, who crashed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunk or turmoil, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokeswoman of the public ministry of the capital after the relative constatation was established.
The findings confirmed the first outcome of the investigation that already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he put himself on the drive.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police department of the 22nd district crashed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd district.
(In addition, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute a relieving circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turning must let pedestrian pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
After the accident, the commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, the accident greatly disturbed him.
The investigation is conducted by the Prosecutor’s Office for the Budapest Investigation.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner has cooperated from the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three agreements of a total value of €400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of €300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund whose €100 million credit agreement has already been signed by the parties.
The credit agreement of €150 million also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, the remaining €150 million will be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of €50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this package first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-debat the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the funding of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of €8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB gives its credits according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grant period of eight years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate market of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market which is still the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
The Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most pop-up destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shore of the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sables", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly numerous looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the shops and office surfaces promise the highest amortisation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in a large number, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
On the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski stations, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old houses degraded, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (from last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term added value.
The prices of the capital’s buildings are constantly rising due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have risen by 21 percent each year.
The rise in real estate prices essentially exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor, the meetings of professionals will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers’ negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to do after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
Currently, there is a strong discussion on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also that, for the moment, they do not want to discuss accurate figures, although they are ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to the level of 1990.
Another important topic of the conference is to see if developed countries are committed, in addition to emissions reduction, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
A agreement has also been signed on the aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors consisting of 16 members probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, confirms the ambition of the EU to keep its role as Admiral vessel in global efforts aimed at protecting the climate and encouraging the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent before 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce them to 30 percent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also willing to take commitments adapted to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signing the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 percent and all 15 EU members at that time took the commitment of 8 percent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, reminds the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is big in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduction below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system whose need was emphasized in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which won the Nobel Peace Prize of the United Nations, responsible for taking care of climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the average Earth temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
The units of the British army, on the video sharing site, report recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan upload videos on the operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with the help of miniature cameras set on the helmet, are monitored at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and they are then transferred to London or compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this path and their “chain” has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Ministry registered under the name of "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos about the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Maintenance Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial goal of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defense, they also served to make the public aware of the real goals of the army’s presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this path does not cost practically anything compared to the usual recruitment ads posted on television, according to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, defense consultant. In contrast, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have a game.
The army is troubled because, in addition to the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the “official” propaganda films, slightly hypocritic, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the battle.
Moreover, many videos had already passed on the net showing the operating zones in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real mission, but the British army has been packing for the upload of these videos only recently.
The Americans make the recruitment a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, the minister of labor, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a weekend meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking beignets and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will charm officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Feast, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertain the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but not the ministry employees will be invited to it.
On Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (OIT) with concerts and dinner.
The room’s rental cost a million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the company that manages the tender.
The building of the Theatre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to contact the responsible.
The costume is not mandatory.
The building of the ILO not only welcomed the NFÜ but the Ministry of Justice and Police also who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a dance on the occasion of St. Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not allow them to pay for the use of their rooms.
The ball was five hundred.
The party began with the minister’s welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening dress was not mandatory at all for this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a feast.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite its employees to a Christmas party but to a year-end work meeting.
A hundred eighty people are expected to be invited to drink a coffee and eat beignets, the press service said, the party will cost 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room in which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forins per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned party atmosphere, the official character is strengthened not only by the minister's exhibition but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held in the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Tree, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few welcome words from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not make a party at all for Christmas, the corresponding press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega strike forces gather
The Syndicates of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday, which will be charged with coordinating Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the health care funds law, the strike will begin.
This action will surely cause significant locks in the traffic as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV (public transport company) employees will also make a strike until 13:00.
The League Syndicates will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they fail to find an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the health care funds law, is not defined.
If the National Assembly fails to adopt the law on health funds, the syndicates will immediately withdraw the call to the strike.
However, if the law is voted, the strike committees will meet and decide what to follow.
According to the national assembly’s Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the health care funds law will take place only late at night or even at night.
Due to the scheduled strike on Monday, significant closures are planned in the traffic: railways will stop the work for an indefinite period and in the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, in different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call to the strike, the list of them is constantly updated on the League site.
Some organizations report to make the strike for an indefinite period, while others have declared a temporary stop of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trailer Syndicate (VDSZSZ) failed to find an agreement on the minimum services, gold, at the approaching of Christmas holidays, more and more are those taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest’s public transport will make a strike from the start of service until 13h, Budapest airport between 7h and 9h in the morning, the League’s Electricity and Thermal Energy Industrial Syndicates will make a four-hour strike, the Teachers’ Syndicate and the Democratic Teachers’ Syndicate have called for a strike respectively for 2 hours and from 2h to 8h.
The National Association of Doctors will make a two-hour warning strike throughout the country, the Health and Social Sector Employees Syndicate (EDDSZ) associated with SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on the health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new pension calculation method to be implemented from the next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim requires a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to be passed into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trailer Syndicate (VDSZSZ), associated with the League Syndicates, of the Ministry of Economy and Transport proposal on secondary railways and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August last year, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Tzigan and non-Tzigan population of Hungary.”
The research institution added that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy that is likely to cause this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “the public actors have passed the public debate on the Rom affair to representatives of radical and extreme political unions that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Zygan and the Hungarians.”
The problem is worsening, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are stronger and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
But, according to the research institut, under the effect of the increased attention of Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country.”
They remind that, following a greater advertisement given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 giving itself the name of “National Self-Defense Association”.
“The common trait of these assemblies is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, in addition, referring to the inability of the police, of the army, otherwise of the state,” they added.
They that everything was going according to the method that, based on the ranker of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid legal traps from the registration of these associations in the court but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, many neighboring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultranationalist political actors in some neighboring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Rom disorders that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the source of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Using the benefits of these events, the BNU decided to form a guard, saying that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense.”
According to them, in the last 17 years, the cigans have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital reminds.
They added that the initiative had raised vibrant debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations about the establishment of their own guard as a resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roms react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the risk change, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The festival is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law exactly defines the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States as well.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
The days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, this last even more so that the awakeners can rest calmly.
In one year, we have a total of 11 holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23 is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the day of work and on 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and our dead friends.
We also have two days on Easter, Pentecostal and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or there is only one working day left before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of prolonged weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the prolonged weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has stated in a particular regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their employees, to officials and to people working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that turn without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also for the days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: starting December 24, life ends almost throughout the country because according to experiences most people rather do extra hours or take the holidays they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and the New Year day at home.
The next year many holidays fall in the middle or in the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work day to allow employees to stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the contrary, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will make a non-stop break even if the new year’s day falls on a Wednesday.
Six foolish things that can terribly bother colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: they are things that “make up” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these troubles or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
of examples.
“Sorry, I’ve forgotten to tell you that you’ve been called for a marketing service,” a colleague told you.
Have you missed a date?
At the best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is arranged with apologies.
Before you have difficult explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make an effort to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember that the previous day you put the graffiti on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, otherwise they're right to be angry against you because they've picked up their good.
Don’t bring back containers, post it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more and you need it immediately.
Are you interested in the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the potins that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t mislead his trust!
Dive in yourself the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Do you feel sick without a reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a broken headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be performed by someone else instead of you.
Do not bother your colleagues.
If you know in advance that the next day you won’t work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid them to be surprised by your absence the next day.
Closing, Closing and Phone
Are you immersed in your work, but your colleagues’ scratching brings you out of it brutally?
Have you become, without wanting, a witness of a telephone conversation that you would have done better than not listening to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with freezing, singing, high-speaking discussions (which you lead above their heads), footbreaks, big words or high-speaking dissatisfaction.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you accuse others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not accuse anyone for that forgotten!
Don’t put it on account of the potential chaos in the office or your loud colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused disadvantages to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix your negligence!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Put a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put a comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don’t be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing yourself properly, and if your function requires it by putting beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet your expectations, you are no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning cover.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I raise the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choral comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar’s Wings of Love.
The Hungarian musical life has not ruined us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cover becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of the garage rock breaking the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he ran on his own path, because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
The training at first played in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 quoted their first 2002 album among the fifty most important albums in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost the only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole have become undoubtedly “trend” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group reacted properly, he released a new and better album.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new roads for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years passed in Beijing.
It was that it was a line of the former group of Pecs of Balázs Zságer.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but next to air music appears now, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?).
Hg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: is your music still a music targeting a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music targeting a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two casts in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-calling alternative, underground music can also be poor and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be honest too.
The reception attitude works in this mind also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the youth of a decade or twenty years but also the older.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
Q: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the audience is more important in the concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the unmistakable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would not be interesting anymore.
Hg.hu: Are you planning to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his way even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let it be deployed.
In the beginning, it was inevitable that our music was compared to Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another way.
hvg.hu: On Mr2 Petõfi's palmarès, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through the way of this song.
With this more popular style, did you consciously open to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to weaken the orgia of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
Q: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a coral of the gospel genre.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choral was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later baptized Underground Divas.
Q: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song had existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing in that song.
The success of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sing the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at that time but we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she’t have the same strength.
HGH: On the album and at the concert, it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except a short solo of Judy Jay), they don’t have a role alone, they all sing together and they don’t sing stronger than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their song.
They were behind the scene too.
Is that desired?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were backward is only due to technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we didn’t want to distribute roles of solists.
The song also says that we must forget a little our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we must just let those wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to also feel that euforic state we felt when the song was born.
Q: Which of the songs made you work most?
Zs.B.: In fact, no one regarding the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, either I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, slowly, everything got up as in a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “latched” this album.
Today, the prophet is a fool, escape from the earth and never the same.
The trader risks billions due to its inferiority complex
A hidden fraud.
This is how his former employee designates the French giant the General Company, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost about 5 billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is just a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered unable.
Unlike all major bank houses, it has recognised in time the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
“He’s fragile,” his senior members told the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel’s deposit by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit of €1.6 billion.
The crisis exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the deposit.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the U.S. crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had in the past had difficulty with refund, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and he put it well.
So, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"Since I had won my first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he, of course, didn't keep anything for himself."
In all the interrogation, he acknowledges that he has falsified the reports so that he is not inspected.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Whoever risks nothing has nothing.
Was he afraid to be discovered?
rather not.
“I estimated that the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where does it come to risk so much?
He reached his position only gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my academic course and my professional and personal journey," Kerviel told the researchers.
Shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he earned half a billion euros by beting on the drop of this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, you will be left in peace.
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told the police.
But the superior were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they were pretending to close their eyes."
That’s when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he comes to work, he is no longer employed in the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost 5 billion euros due to him.
How did we discover it?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
Last year, I only took four days of vacation.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion dollars
The Ministers of the Czech Republic signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007-2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programs will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns as part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program.
The transport sector will benefit mostly, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can obtain as part of these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90,8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, intended for SMEs and entrepreneurs, should serve to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should get financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was one of the least successful EU funding beneficiaries among the new members.
The court confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the sentence of 20 years in prison for former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (approximately $1.8 billion).
But later he was released and lived assigned to residence in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again or not, it is for now, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, either they will let Aleman end his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved that German regularly moved government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
It was fictitious societies and the accounts actually belonged to members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that German had created to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget was adopted.
It is so.
The state budget has been adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government’s majority without the support of the opposition.
That for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was the minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the agitated debate before the vote of the government's disbelief declaration, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives has adopted without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether you want it or not, every chapter and every article constitutes the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that’s why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians are much more interested in the opinion than the sharp figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered three evils that the current budget is unable to fix at the same time:
The first is the significant part granted to the costs of mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by the pensions but also by the social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the parties CSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, the result of the first bad.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the greatest algae.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real bomb of delay is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in turmoil, bonds, debtlessly to their municipalities, in order to obtain, in addition to the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the state as part of the privatizations.
They no longer have this source.
If only official and verified facts are observed, it is noted that:
Our economy has already gone through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD does not lack to wait for it.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly pushing the state.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that runs mainly to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least threatened by poverty globally.
We therefore do not need massive social programs that have, just in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily flooded.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, have been eliminated, if a decalation of the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, it will only administer.
By hardly exaggerating, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become bureaucrates that mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That’s why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be rejected by mandate expenses.
The $70 billion deficit for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don’t want the politicians in power to become simple bureaucrates, we must be patient and give to this fragile governmental coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it happens to get in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will allow progressively to a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” says Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group’s customer report.
“The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to approximately 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-refunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting more billion losses.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still be followed," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will borrow more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and dive the U.S. economy into a recession that could influence global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after it failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This means that the banks were still afraid of mutual loans, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“This will have the same effect as a new fall in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not contribute to conjuring the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
President Klaus: Ecologists' Debates Are Incredible
Global climate change is predicted to affect mainly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the problem of global warming.
The criticism came down this time at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the ecologists' debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference that is between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, replacing solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance for him and that is why he is so committed to this issue.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions."
Now, people interested can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he still, in his opinion, has enough arrangements to write such a book.
He is in fact an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, so its changes are normal, there is no shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, so they do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the climate change are useless, inefficient and unacceptablely expensive.
Moreover, having the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, what he feels as a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers let the deadline expire and failed to renew their old driving license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still request the renewal, so the authorities are able to issue them a new license before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license especially those who do not want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a decline in the number of license renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are invaded by applications and the number of license renewal applications has gone growing this week.
The municipality welcomes approximately 2,000 customers per day.
There is a hole of about half an hour.
In Prague, 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving license.
The issue of a new license takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the release within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay an additional fee of five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to perform the mandatory renewal of the driving license by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid license, will risk, from January, a fine.
The guilty will be forced to pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, a fine was susceptible even a person who was not going to circulate.
In this case, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had called on authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
But, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver’s license is a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not as with the identity card that, it must be valid without exceptions.
Those who do not want to drive should be given their driving license.
It is only necessary to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licenses.
Persons possessing documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to renew.
The validity of the driving license issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the penalties of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of connivence with the David Berdych gang, will make 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
Thus, the Supreme Court of Prague sentenced them definitively by reducing their penalties by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives at the Department for the Fight Against Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment issued today, only a appeal to the Supreme Court is considered.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received in other trials the penalties of which the amount exceeds 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal declared guilty for participating in hold-up 19 persons, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have, since the start of the investigation, questioned the accusation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted to criminals information from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation is about the gang’s criminal activity in the years 1999-2001.
Essentially armed flights whose victims have, in most cases, suffered a serious health damage, but also by the abuse of power of a public agent and forbidden weapons.
During the domestic searches, the police have in fact discovered illegally held pistolets, pistols with a steel core, a direct laser shooting visor, or a gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from twenty men from this trial, the courts have already recognized guilty of other hand-stolen Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men from the neighborhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the moment, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in prison in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of the replacement of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the wounded families Igor Veleba wants to get from the Třebíč hospital a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for the fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That’s why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely disagreeing with Veleba’s proposal.
“We reject such a claim, this is very high,” Dostál said at the hearing.
“To be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert report whose counterpart has ordered the writing.
We will check if it has an explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month when she couldn't raise her biological daughter.
Veleba served the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document to support for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatrics experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they had faced regrets of not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less calm in the face of the trauma in the current and what is happening right now, the content of the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina region Miloš Vystrčil gave, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the refund of the expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are bound by law to civil liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must pull into the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensations, the amounts calculated according to the tables were about hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute regarding the brand Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was actually he who used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
“The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka,” said after the trial Polívka’s lawyer.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job behind us for almost 10 years.
Search for money and developing events,” he said.
Money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and they could benefit from it.
They are those who want to parasite on our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned king in 1993.
But at that time, it had nothing to do with the plan of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of the Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action originally came out a profitable business and business activity, followed by Harabiš’s creation of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature were cited in the passport and he even offered the holders of salds on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatrical shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has only used the idea naked, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
“The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has helped the Valašské království project,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was composed by Harabiš and his team who was intensely dedicated to the project.
The cooperation between the today enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polivka an official crown in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polivka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposit of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the planned tournament for the throne and half the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go quickly.
It would be like the parade of the kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously sign up,” Harabiš added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Prejudice Disappearance
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, driving and also the quality of manufacturing could, in many ways, be qualified as lower than the average.
But now there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is significantly better.
Especially as the combi called SW goes a step further, I have only to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, of the head space on the back seats.
While there end the complaints because the combi carrossery means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let’s see it quickly
I’m going to talk very quickly about the inside so that I don’t repeat too much.
This is an approximately successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain of seats or too short records has passed.
The side guidance has also significantly improved compared to the model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the carrossery is sensitive there too.
The combi also disappears the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A box in the box.
The most important thing about this car is its baggage.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the back rotating ice) and a rather easy rear.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not overwhelming and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
Let’s stop on the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a fairly average figure compared to competition.
In addition to the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we see that the Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the difference is 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or charging a pocket, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to make the advantages out, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reversal of the back seats records perfectly right, or a very low marchepied.
120 horses divided on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
In fact, this is what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by ŠKODA which often gives the impression of having an escape pot stuck by a serpent, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Go through the tariffs
The price of the car is not affordable to everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a pretty well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4 litre Otto engine ranging to 329,900 CZK is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 CZK, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of CZK 80,000.
In addition, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ice drying, automatic control of the back windows...
In fact, the car costs at the end of the account 531 900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but try to add to the price of Fabia the additional equipment and you’ll get a very similar figure.
There is only to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools goes wrong
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, causing concerns among the remaining about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans faces, for now, a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the remaining opposition conflicts and Slovak-born immigrants begin to accentuate, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chikanes and disputes between the students have transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who hit a 10-year-old student with a iron bar.
The accused defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist statements.
Police also had to intervene after the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The young girls had allegedly addressed racist remarks to this man and threw stones to him.
“When we came home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and began to crack on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his hips,” another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
The complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining went to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous inhabitants and immigrants begins to get tired.
70,000 Slovak people who came to work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Gold and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a quiet sea like a lake.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you a pizza, ice or drunk cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find this list not only in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb described it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transbording of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built in the early 20's.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who made it build, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients there was, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings have risen and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And then today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars continue to circulate in Havana, as the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long been dirty, in a so salt and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decreeped, none else in the surrounding area there are so many splendid colonial monuments as there are exactly there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has a green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguin province, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small trains fans.
The canyon was returned from the plantations extended in the sweeteneries on a narrow road by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling equipment has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen in operation, whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where to take his steps?
Most visitors don’t miss the most famous places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Valley of Viñales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on a calcary soil.
Mogotes, calcary ballons, and rocks rise into candles from the bottom of the valley, and since the fertile soil has been taken into their inside, even its dirty rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Cigar Factory in Havana.
Someone may also find interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market the trade of slaves and the sugar that brought it glory and wealth.
The wealth has embodied itself in the beauty and the city-vitrine character of this small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí almost nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain mass, is a place so far away that still in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We did not build anything, and that’s why we didn’t destroy anything, everyone just had a roof above the head.
If you have, in Trinidad, more time than a afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is common to go to the Casa de la Música which is animated after the sunset and where music is turning up only in the morning.
by Baracoa
Some designate this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and accidental mountains and cross a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has recorded the East Cuban landscape, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the present hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigarettes, the mountainous massive Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Truies and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of ancient slaves, about all this could be filled a number of pages.
Just as we say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, the Americans say
The lack of troops and necessary equipment affects, according to the United States, the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said that NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight involved states today also discuss future plans and the co-ordination of the allies.
While the United States has called on NATO troops for greater activity this week through Defense Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security by themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC.
eighty percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the U.S. military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, up to 60 percent in the province of Helmand, located south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which a quarter in the south.
But, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the upcoming period, as well as how to them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar statements today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we’d need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved on the question of whether all the allies actually do everything they can in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements to which they are subject are not as rigorous as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun said this week the German soldiers were lazy.
“The Afghans are discovered: the Germans play while our struggles,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild passed to the counterattack by publishing the photo of a British team during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to 1 billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies to each Czech Republic.
The total debt increased at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow this year 159.2 billion crowns.
Thanks to a better change in the state budget economies than expected, the ministry decreased the expected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
But from June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt that dates from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns lies to each Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state has debt over 111 billion crowns.
“At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for the next year, we could exceed the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
The next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the server iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appears that the situation on the political scene is changing, that the politicians are ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debt increases
State debt is made up of the debt of the central government and is generated essentially by the accumulation of the deficits of the state budget.
State debt is funded by treasury bonds, interest rates, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The state debt called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average exigibility of the state debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the interest rates where it reaches 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be a matter to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
It follows the government’s financial and debt management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
But, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better than expected state budget economy shift, the ministry decreased the expected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The amount is essentially made up of the state budget deficit that will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
Next, these are the maximum sources for the Czech consolidation agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state retirement securities for 43 billion crowns and the reimbursement of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She appeared today before a court in Khartoum for naming a peluchy bear.
The British teacher sentenced in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
She was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a peluchy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a punishment of shooting.
This 54-year-old British teacher in charge at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and accused of violating Islam and sedition, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, following several complaints of parents of students to the Sudan Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7 years, to choose a name for the class bear.
“Eight names come out of the children’s mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Muhammad is, of course, the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he said it was just a “innocent mistake.”
A comment shared by many students of the instructor who describe her as "very careful to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last meeting in Vienna.
At the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Understood that peace in the region was “in play,” its U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not predict violence immediately but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, adding that “evident tensions exist.”
End of Mediation on December 10th
The Troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council, by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was charged with a new mediation by the UN in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council’s granting of independence to Kosovo, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence.
After eight years of U.N. administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina says she is willing to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favour.
Belgrade is seeking increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” said President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where these “last chance negotiations” were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future provincial prime minister, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomous plan presented by Belgrade “applied to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
“Domino effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
“For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament has the last word.
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the Western.
Bush signs agreement between Palestinians and Israelis
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held by his careers on Tuesday in Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately engage in negotiations in order to find a final solution to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have to dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel has to end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their obligations with regard to the "roadsheet" for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority headed by Abbas would "target to conclude a peace treaty solving all the issues suspended, without exception, including the central issues."
This call covers the three pineal issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations are “global and deep” and cover all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert promised that the upcoming negotiations will be "direct and continuous" and "a effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for implementing his “vision of two states” Palestinian and Israeli co-existing.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the source of a plan, supported by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the Middle East history, more especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," the Saudi prince said in his interview with the Arab-speaking Saudi capital newspaper.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of different fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not homologated, therefore not allowed to circulate on public roads” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “in a very vibrant look”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a rejection of priority on the right,” a police officer said.
The control of alcoholemia on the vehicle’s passengers was negative.
The state of the car (pre-deployed, star-brise, drawn shocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that it has entrusted an investigation for “acts of involuntary murder and non-assistance to anyone in danger” to the IGPN, in cohesion with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stage was removing the responsibility of the police.
According to the court, three witnesses, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed “the version of the police, that is that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left.”
Yesterday, a kind of rainure, undoubtedly caused by the throwing of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained locked as long as the police car managed to freeze.
Vehicles have been arrested and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsed.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have very quickly left the places, thus not borrowing help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also eliminate “all serious mistakes” regarding this point.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which must be very cautious,” a police source said.
Liberation met a eye witness of these few moments that followed the accident.
It is a window that looks exactly on the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to remove them, the witness tells.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely harsh police officer, who was boiling.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young people, the fourth spoke by telephone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had the unexpected situation of the youth, the police were taken by cars by colleagues arriving on the site.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “approximately twenty minutes after the police departed.”
They also practiced heart massage in vain.
“I’m not going to say that the police have not supported the young people.
The young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the emergency state was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken as part of the emergency state were wounded by the lacrymogenic grenades used by the police, according to witnesses.
They were shot with stones, wounding police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police charged and injured lawyers.
Several have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets providing access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were held in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement gathered support from the religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president “invited the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and damages to those who swear before Musharraf.”
The promise of Musharraf is no longer in place.
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly targeted by the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It had to vote within the coming days on the legitimacy of the presidential re-election, on 6 October, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was expelled and replaced.
“Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise of leaving the head of the army and becoming a civil president “no longer stands” after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform until November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different contraception methods such as pills or sterility still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has yet allowed a better “fertility control,” according to the Institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated in the month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
It will take more than seven hours of space work to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew colleagues at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel, essential to the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky outlet that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools “bricked” by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday as astronauts had discharged from the Discovery ship the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece charged to host soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see encadred).
This module is a kind of attachment for the laboratory modules.
They must be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move a solar panel electricity production module weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, to put it up on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the re-planning of the solar panels of the module that have a size of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which displays like accordeons, was damaged about a meter by a cable that was stuck.
The deployment was stopped in order not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were initially required to take a check out of the Discovery ship and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go carcover at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the ship added to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalker.
Great, resistant, very adroit, it has the torse very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician was therefore charged with “operating” the “ranked” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damages, he cut off the defective cable and installed kinds of "atels" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second “spacewalker” staying near the sas and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey canon covered with insulator to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “bricoled” by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before he made the inventory of his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS stock is currently in a sharp decline at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Air and Defense Group announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to face the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational outcome for 2007 due to the delays caused by the slow progress in the engine development of the A400M, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of removing the delay taken in the delivery of military aircraft sound, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new operating outcome goals (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further accurate details.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the EADS operating outcome fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the statu quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the outcome of the urns: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, and even to authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days after the election, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this as the head of the list of the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced to be devastating.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything out by receiving foreign ambassadors, just delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference – his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we wish the most honest, transparent and open elections, the untouched elections,” he added.
In the opposition, we are far from counting.
It is a pressure-filled campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Zyuganov says that there has never been "this dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus"
Behind these uninterrupted legislative elections there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not run a third consecutive term.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Heads of the parliamentary majority and the entirely powerful party of the United Russia who would choose the government and the president?
In the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
This is a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they don’t feel master of their fate,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has taken a delay in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic facility,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “reject fully on their personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the dissolution of the USSR.
“What to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (from 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, concludes: “What is good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which track the destins of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far consultable only for a “humanitarian” purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or its rightholders.
The eleven states responsible for their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the public opening of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest mandates established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to mandatory work and, if possible, to provide them with evidence of their internation, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen has a limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said in 2006 Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light in April last year to the European Commission to engage in negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth trade partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade treaty will greatly dop both economies" and "India will improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regreting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential".

The Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday concerned about relieving the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“In order to relieve concerns that the financial market conditions will be tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market transaction,” she said in a statement.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10th.
This is the first time the BoE seems to put on the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
This is usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is “ready to take other measures to maintain the interest rates” of interbank loans daily online with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had dissuaded the banks from using it.
According to some rumors, confirmed by the change in the price of the pound compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, among which the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a check-transport or the lease framework.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was lifted after the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s television intervention on purchasing power.
PS Deputies Leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectificative finance law examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival takes place
Following numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has, neither more nor less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-ownership, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he’ve ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working together to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we’ve gotten into politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately we’ve been able to talk with Melvin Benn and we’re preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a field festival, while our ones are rather held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to fuse, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of the European and Urban Festival to the American.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, supports with enthusiasm the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but claims “that they are interesting enough to allow you to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says the reception capacity of this festival is “very big,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations were launched to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will taste rock, but music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract the Hollywood film platoes in Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate’s functions.
A mandate – “politically difficult” because California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces “runaway productions”.
Is it hard to play in the legs of the “Governator”?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best,” he says.
The Race of the Festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be of all West Coast festivals, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting the Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-premes crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the financial year, investors are already throwing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, predictions should not be made exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainty looks at the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange to take the momentum over the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that “the stock market feeds thanks to the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of leak to quality values both in long periods and in short periods.”
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility “especially because we are not aware of the impact of the likely fall of the Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationist tensions.”
Javier Barrio, BPI sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert assures.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, lost 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to retirement schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a bit different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to the technical levels and "this is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused based on the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analysts hope that this will be positive.
The analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum boxes.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Investis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event they are putting into it.
"ACS has recovered from positions for several months and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December has been a falling month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, a year during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded a 6.68% increase.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds on computer at its final rally.
People's Bank will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to restore a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organisations, since it is the first group to decide to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10h to 20h30.
Another group that has also repeated several times that he would want to amplify the schedules of his branches, BBVA, although he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with the trading schedules.
This is exactly what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers that circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies deployed across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the time extension is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the branch and a new, more up-to-date design with brighter colors.
Commercial manager of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of the Murillo Brave streets, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success apparently, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which open even on Sunday and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero notes.
Currently, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with a staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We have arrived there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegated counsel of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closure of the stock market, when he found that the chain he managed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect thinnered his joy: “What hurt me is not the fact that we have increased more but we have decreased less,” he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% in a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (up to 13%) reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and which accumulates a decrease of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies listed on the Stock Exchange is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising management subsidiary.
In order for this announced data to be real, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising bills for the current financial year compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year.
For its part, the net invoice for Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors analytics point out for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important pay out it hasined so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give for a minimum of 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market shows signs of fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the expected decline in income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenna’s profit forecast 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which enters into force on 1 November
Along with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with Congress voting the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by the MPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate the activities of the bodies in detail so that the markets work effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Law of the Value Market, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at the time it strengthens the investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Commission of the Value Market (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will enable the provision of financial consultancy services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFI), which fuse securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading and order internationalization systems, which face competition to current stock exchange managers.
The law also obliges investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and it obliges them to keep a register of all the transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate the control by the CNMV.
Through the Congress’s Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one which highlights that the titled debt will be considered as a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated with what has happened with the high-risk U.S. mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they have taken advantage of the transposition of the management has taken advantage of legally delimiting the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, the royal decree that delimites the professional functions reserved to economists was approved.
On its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to borrow its products marketing services and attract new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rises from five-thirds in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves to Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a report on the price changes in Spain during November.
The publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as the one used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modeling to estimate the information on which we are not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE reminded that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14th.
“The IPC will continue at relatively high levels”
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said the increase of 4.1% in the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain regarding the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
“We expect a figure around 4 percent,” the Minister of Economy recognised in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock $42,000 million over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50 percent to £12,000 million (16,800 million euros) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to recourse to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he gathered some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months due to the uncertainty of his customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and that it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to deposit around a quarter of the British banks’ revenue that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining £18,000 million until it reaches the target of £30,000 million.
The magnat group Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Association’s offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favourite to save him from the banquet.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) due to his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
Moreover, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the police chief of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the May I Juan Morales, the current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal counselor of the municipality, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'manager' of this plot.
The agents continue to investigate the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of new arrests is not excluded in the coming hours.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the SER chain indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the 'People' party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with the important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged incass of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party’s list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be the President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
So the organization secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he emphasized that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono will replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who on November 15 last announced his decision not to attend the next general elections and to abandon his political career to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist on his return to the political avant-garde since he abandoned it two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one that will preside the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into a "home of respect and not of insult or scream" and make it "all more and more like citizens."
“Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local in Madrid where you can’t speak calmly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate in some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
Similarly, he had praise words for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "knowledge to do" and he didn't want to do as if he already occupied his position to not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents could consider as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to miseryless persecution, both the skeptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is especially the case for a movement leader who is the president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet.”
This approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed in a decisive way to making Spain the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens’ habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Just because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are impopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him readily so dangerous to Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequences.
With phrases that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who doesn’t speak, who doesn’t denounce and who doesn’t demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and which does not claim that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmery has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, today sources of the investigation.
The municipal counselor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at this time many agents gathered, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Counselor Function of Urbanism and to the municipal enterprise for the management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
Furthermore, two other persons have not been arrested but they are attributed in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Court No. 1 instructs.
The first six prisoners have been sent to court order.
According to the sources, the former municipal counselor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
Furthermore, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal counselor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the pots-de-vin would have been made.
The investigation is in charge of the Urban Crimes Group of the Operative Central Unit (UCO) of the gendarmery whose agents, in addition to the arrest, have conducted eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to prisoners and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was therefore arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known bird product company in the region, who could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired at Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would suppose to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which take care of real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo’s parking spaces in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which takes care of direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us the comment of yesterday appeared in the most important newspaper of Finland (surely in the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day when it appeared there, curiously, the Blackburn book criticism:
“The contents of the Philosophy course interrogated the public as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor’s student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Platon on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable from a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value less than 400 euros is only considered a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the penalty for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a dispute than to participate in compact disk traffic.
Participating in a tumultuous struggle involves a fine from three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs involves a fine from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code)
Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films and without the author’s permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My doctor treated me about one of his articles on strange research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less '.
That is, the feelings that the monthly wages of the workers generate depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonance at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest Science edition.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition images group at the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion requires so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has for eight years implacably pursued the Balkan war criminals from the public ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in the Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of the murder of Srebrenica – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed – the former general Ratko Mladic and the former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York that pursues the criminals fleeing and makes pressure on the governments involved to shorten the circle.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible crimes, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that it is made, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
There is that, choosing the vehicle insurance adequado is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This commitment is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the awarded premium and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that it is made, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the likelihood of a accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
That’s why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of crimes than their carefulness.
Similarly, using reviews, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must well study the situation to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have to face various inconveniences when signing a contract with an affordable insurance, such as the poor driving experience and the age of the driving license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most predictive drivers can choose for a risk insurance with franchise, so that they get the coverage of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the damage.
"The part of the amount of the damages that the customer will be paid will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," said Luis Noguera, the Spanish manager of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to face damages caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and vehicle loss.
and a advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be cautious and avoid crimes as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction of the basic fee that the company possesses.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase in the basic tariff.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera clarifies.
Over the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers at the time of signing a contract with an insurance, as the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
That’s why it’s best to choose a risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally young people can't enjoy the experience previously acquired after an accident," assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of driving, once passed 'the fear of the novice '.
However, if the customer is married but has no children it is better that he negotiates an insurance at any risk, since his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as the people with the lowest rate of crimes, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk insurance with franchise (which may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the vehicle’s third year of life when the insured has a high bonus level.
“They have a more relaxed driving and they have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises,” Luis Noguera says.
For retirees a risk insurance with franchise is preferable (as this is 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver facing possible crashes, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, that is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win one point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to rank.
The Italians totaled ten points and they already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass before him.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC will compete in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the 16th December final.
So, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the stadium Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that winning he will remain first and will ensure a better cross in the eighth of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to compute only on that since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week at Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milaners will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hope to rank for the eighth of the final for the second time in the Champions League, after being defeated during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the prolongations (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth of the final to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And that’s that Benfica, although it’s the last and without any possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls launched in Vancouver (Canada), in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to watch the concert that was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that was angry at the end of the 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that takes back their main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls rise on stage showing the bracelets that the spouse of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' which was part of the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" and which caused the group's dissolution two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
“I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw people’s feelings changed, Spice Girls’ feelings changed.
And I thought why not, I’m happy to have made a decision,” Chisholm said on the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “the things have been arranged and we appreciate ourselves a lot.”
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last exhibited in 1998.
According to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special plane.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
She has five and seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
The event will be held in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A gas price dispute ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is closely monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supply to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company that supplies gas, tried in vain, to find an agreement on the cost of the Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would rise as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that it would involve an increase of 40% in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding that we are a country through which most gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom’s supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a decline in exports to Western Europe, resulting in increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under-developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health has to “control its foreign employees”.
The Scottish Ministry of Health has to improve the controls to be carried out on its non-Community employees to check whether they have previous penals, the control committee said.
The warning of the General Inspector, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the June airport attack.
Mr. Black also expressed concern over the fact that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no precise data about the number of overseas people he employs.
The report, however, highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The general revisor carried out inspections on the extra-community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dropping with his jeep in the door of the main terminal.
It was part of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employed inspections on the overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out the inspections of previous penals, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside the UK.
Among the many warnings, the general revisor’s report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office for the control of previous penalties, thus allowing employers to undertake controls in different countries.
“Al we have found that some personal information has been checked well, this is not done every time,” the report says.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: “Our report highlights the aspects in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some members of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, Chairman of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks can identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said, “The report suggests that pre-employment checks are currently working well in the Scottish health system and it is not certain that these warnings may bring some added value.”
The Scottish health authorities said they employ 1161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the general revisor emphasized that these figures must be reviewed up, in part due to the problems related to the identification of staff members with indefinite-term contracts, who could choose whether or not, to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of health authorities control in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and its pre-employed control system for staff members beyond the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish government allied to the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that is expected to be published next month, and would commit to ensure a better execution of the newly updated pre-employment checks, and valid for all employees, including people from overseas.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrorist conspirates
Saudi Arabia has recently revealed that it has arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells managing an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile counterparts.
Al Qaeda’s supporters have launched a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the newspaper TV.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites after a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Interior Minister, said that 18 of the people arrested belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned an anti-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the prisoners appear to have conspired the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government urged the ecclesiastics to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join al-Qaeda activists fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered to be heretic according to the hard line of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by the calls against the pro-West Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,” the Interior Minister’s spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medine organized in a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unbelievers and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European orbit vessel have shown that the planet is twice smaller than Earth, unlike what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically of the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to the solar radiation associated with a slower rotation led Venus to a different kind of evolution.
Today, the planet is water-free, is devastated by hurricanes and light storms and has a surface of temperature warm enough to flourish the lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s spacecraft, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to the catastrophic climate change.
Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand why the Venus climate is so different from the Earth, although the planets in themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would originally have been identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Uranus is enriched by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czech and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not at the height as a presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters having recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one out of another debate on You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position over the global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the upcoming elections.
It is unknown on what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one topic, focused on immigration.
This is one of the topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The regiment raised approvals when candidates spoke rough.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney who is the leader of the major anticipated elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became ferocious when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an amnesia (offering the clandestines a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen this topic.
No one of them has the possibility to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, aligned with concerns arising in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears toward the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the liberals and the Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the weapons control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be considered a torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in their entirety, the contents of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not about to believe in the story of Jonas and the Whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in the Iowa position during a recent election, thanks to his long-term Christian conservationism - to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he started laughing and said that Jesus was too chic to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unlikely open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious subsidy research carried out by liberator Ron Paul, and the sweat during Wednesday's debate.
These two there are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party defenders are unable to agree to decide who is the most well-known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in a timely and convincing way through a message of success on American greatness, bringing the leaders closer.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to dive; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not juteous.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra married foot finger sucked.
But here is a revelation testifies that a wealthy businessman had masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back in his election plan, stupidly insulting the British intelligence proclaiming that opinions have not influenced his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal-democratic leader, said that the scary Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The recovery of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a fault in the directives and a weak judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code have caused a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of lazy donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former head of vigilance) have made them to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is promptly moving towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but they usually leave their doubts off when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister can’t improve things, nor even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: public administration doesn’t work anymore; ministry cabinets make the balance; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defence and without any objective anymore.
In a sense, Mr. Brown’s position is difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he can’t pride in being a beginner.
Although he wanted to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The issues related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown’s decisions taken when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation of the party’s funds “of the money counting for the members of the House of Lords”, voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she looks like.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown’s stalinian trends of ever, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abraham, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he didn’t want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of the big politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams’ programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be interrogated, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsible for the collection of subsidies who had spoken about doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing leaves him think he was aware of these steps, even if most of the payments made were made after his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made the half.
He quickly condemned the legislative fault of his party, but he did not attract the attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on a thing he knows well, to resort to an investigation committee on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
If the law is violated, it is the police’s responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financial of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some supportive facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to a victory is to demonstrate irrevocable integrity and solid skills.
The fraud of cards.
Will the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s normal to see swimmers stretched, turning around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market passes a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card-related losses could reach $99 billion if the infection extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the fees and insolvency rates, which measures the unrecoverable or that are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer loans, partly due to the weakness of card holders.
It is too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter is almost a point lower than its historic average.
The deterioration of the rates is partially explainable by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States, concerning personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall of bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions had to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt amount that consumers have to pay.
and trust in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 emission volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market surely exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card emitters pay more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of the property, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of lenders.
They could even bring benefits to credit emitters.
Consumer bonuses for mortgage payments fall if property costs less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repairing the whole.
Card emitters are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, CEO of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there are strong risks of having a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will surely have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the back swim.
British bankers claim guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to witness their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the former Enron financial director, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, claiming guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusive fraud accusations in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should appear to the court in January.
But during an audience chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, became famous all over Britain due to the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a question in suspension for this investigation launched after the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were imposed on them in 2002 made Fastow clear that he was the subject of the government’s investigation in Enron’s breakdown.
The accusations against the bankers, called the "Natwest's Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the scenery of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him cheat the bankruptcy procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A Copper-controlled company bought the bank’s interest for £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow had falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow claimed guilty for his active role in two conspirations in Enron's breakdown.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has been imprisoned for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after paying a $1 million deposit each, which forced them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting trucks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of dismissals, more than $60 billion market value loss and more than $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were empty due to his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither outside of Moscow nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and possessing sufficient fuel autonomy to fly uninterrupted from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts from $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs so many seats as it’s more a family aircraft or for the chairman of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires Show, a four-day consumption incentive orgy, which takes place in an enormous exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to raise the interest of the new rich Russians for their diverse products, ranging from acajou yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scruting a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the US, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
"Through a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, like Dallas."
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerged as the world’s largest pensioners.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the company The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes listing the richest people.
Furthermore, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaries who are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty threshold).
“There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow, that’s why we’re all there,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jewelry designer.
She participated in the exhibition for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Jewelry Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the showroom, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say to be like their customers, millionaries.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who traced her high-covered dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show appears to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to make the hole in the locks to come to an enormous warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canyons, Mövenpick ice, personalized billard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund bears are exhibited.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” Gijrath said, staying proudly at the stand of the Delf Dutch Royal Porcelain Manufacturing Factory, in front of a Raimbrant wall paint on blue cartridges, handmade.
“It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
In fact, sellers said here that the Russians possessing old capital (10 to 15 years are too according to Russian standards) have already passed from brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the exhibition.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaries, millionaries, or tourists, go to the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk matelas, cashmere, and cotton incrusted with gold wire.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with latest alarm systems, also said he has sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalises luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelets-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be incrusted with Swarovski crystals so it looks like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of oak leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaries can at least feel that emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian company of asset management.
The company has raised four stands representing the British telephone cabins, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Passengers arrested to throw masses of bills, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the midst of this false wealth or throwing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unaccepted surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass bay of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That’s where I realized that someone was dead.
The authorities would then find out that the person who died was a 41 year old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which police have not yet identified, residing at the 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo’s death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to resolve this mysterious death that saddened the high-ranks of Newark police.
Melle Arroyo has been the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great working and enduring,” Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“It was like a pit bull.”
“He would have done everything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a granddaughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine if Melle Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgical operation.
“This is a possibility to be considered.”
“The investigation continues.”
The police said they had arrived at around 15 p.m.
And I found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh was unable to confirm whether Melle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are looking to find out if a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Melle Castro where a famous rosier rested in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian bowed in the back.
A blue bean called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in kitchen and for perfumes, lie in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the underground.
Two bicycles hanged on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely precious, helping her to navigate in the new city and to abandon her embedded political culture.
She said, “You have to be careful about this,” he said.
She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rates associated with the global stock exchange fall.
The shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, number 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to calm the irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has partially “inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this hard turbulence should persist, it would increase the chances of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious sign that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest fall in real estate sales for October.
The consequences of this financial turmoil were accrued after Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announced that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are scheduled in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, 2.55% ending to 13.289,40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165,5 points or 2.7% concluding to 6306,2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-appearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted as a result of the high demand for a European Central Bank’s monthly loan auction, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject outer funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions have made that the Monthly Loan Rates “Libor” the British banks, have caused their highest growth since September last year, to 6.59 percent following a strong rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal to trial against the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the 6th player for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General Director of England, begins to fill out the candidacy forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
Those who fail to win the 6th score will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is the same.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck more than because of lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to get Bopara up?
Is that just compared to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, who choose between John Edwards or Banerjee “tubby”?; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a baller must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of the voters is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed sure to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors in 33 tournaments to win one place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
If it’s Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it’s just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also fought to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred score against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another discussion after today’s session at the Asgiriya stadium, will surely follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah’s greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, demands his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious elans in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy of living.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently captured on a 4x4 at a presentation of Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He only delayed slight injuries, he was shocked, although the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his crew who looked at him from a distance, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is far from the best baller, his floating appearance allows him to do the services that go to him, and that he bats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of the selection?
I would be favorable to give his chance to Bopara, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be he who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and fight against al-Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, throwing those exiled without money or without visa renewal, or others who hope that the city has returned to normal.
Some came back to fight against the militants who took them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned with their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I’ve returned home today because I’ve seen on television and read in the newspapers what’s happened in Baghdad and seen the city is more secure now.”
“They say that the Mahdi army does not commit any crimes anymore,” he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, has returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S. aided militia allowed to chase Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to go home.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebell against Al Qaeda.
He had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“This is why I come home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing calmness of the capital since the U.S. troops arrived, and in the sight of continued training of well-armed and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return due to the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi people have fled in the past years.
Salam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about exile visas that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country due to the sectarian death squadrons.
“We didn’t have any problem until al-Maliki arrived in Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give visas to Iraqis, forcing them to return to Iraq,” the retired Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partially explained by the fact that the Sunni have been expelled from the Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will not again raise sectary tensions and bring back the struggles.
A little bit, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in the field of vocational training, and glowes even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-destruction, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarre training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economy in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The University was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high quota of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools in higher numbers than the average – many of them without a gymnasium degree.
“In Sarre, we take advantage of the professional training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a professional school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Also, the possibilities for a combination of professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one-third in recent years.
That’s why the Sarrois Ministry of Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced in the entire federal state comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of childbirth is exempt from law - a model that during other federal states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show if students’ performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the share of risky students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are getting better.
And despite the sarrois, the knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this field.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez runs the clock.
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon make tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will make a half-hour chronometer up in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Venezuelan official newspaper, due to a new law, the clocks will be regulated at less than four and a half hours of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with neither the head of state nor the Colombian government.
"I can't, already just because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw from Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crushed the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chavez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ring is angry in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't silence) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the Spanish king Juan Carlos who, at the latest Ibero-American summit, was angry by the constant interpellations of the left populists and who told him to silence.
A low wage threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong circumstances, according to a forecast, a real lower wage value threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic predictions.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their salary in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the poor wages development, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy and Conjuncture Research, to the journal "Bild".
There may also be new charges on unemployment insurance for the employees.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the unemployment insurance reduction of 3.3 percent for the new year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
The explosion in food and carbohydrate prices has pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from one year to the other.
Venus is the hell twin of the earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than ever thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightings on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" spacecraft today proved it - it detected electromagnetic waves at the boundary of the atmosphere: the light on Venus blows at an altitude of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, the lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that have led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life was there, it must have been at a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thinner than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is the hell twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venus research, since no more spots were on the way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only emphasize the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than expected at first.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the North Pole, a cloud turbine in the South Pole, which turns even much faster.
The phenomenon reminds the air currents in the Earth’s hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italy.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called a night or morning star turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venus day lasts 243 terrestrial days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not much remind Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed in similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus the largest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the parties' dispute about the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
In a indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks against the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summarizes the great coalition to close the dispute about the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not take its distances with the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows it too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) has indirectly revealed his dissatisfaction about the Dalai Lama reception and was attacked for this outside the CDU ranges.
Steinmeier complained of the CDU’s “front policy” in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellor, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only decommanded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, it also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministers.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao now calls on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the welcome of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, so supported Wen Jiabao the Chinese position.
The words and acts of the Dalai Lama would show that he tries to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Sheuble warns against revolts like those in France.
Street struggles with police, shootings, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against revolts like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister called for.
Burning barricades, shooters shooting the police with hunting weapons: after the severe youth revolts in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We need to make sure that a social explosion does not form itself in our home as well and disintegrates into violence.
We need to take this seriously,” he told the New Press in Hannover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get out of it with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This will not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summits to the conferences on Islam, this already shows its first success.”
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schäuble notes at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
This is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded for greater integration efforts from the German government.
Given the revolts in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
However, it would remain a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the percentage of unemployed among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be higher than the average.
More places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give the young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families was more happening in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration don’t want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, “But we still have to be cautious.”
It should be called for “to give the youth the opportunity to participate in work and training.”
Meanwhile, in the Paris faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
Police have three arrestations as well as several cars and rubbish burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces ensures calmness.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, 80 police officers were injured during the protests in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The storms broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the bottom - and there is nothing to expect from it anymore.
In which country does this chancellor live right?
After its disappointing intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of being too focused on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a hard and presumptive phrase.
It’s provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics want.
In the Parliament, it made it clear to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in retreat, who escapes into foreign policy and who even there remains in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it repeatedly welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate goals will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have rejected it even two years ago.
Now it cramps to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
Thus, she destroys her image of a pragmatist, who solves problems rather than embellishes the world.
But in the Angela Cloud Empire, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and worries of low-paid workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
In this regard, it is revealing how many times she makes lapsus when it comes to family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to make a half-precision phrase.
It goes on an unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The branch of attack
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already broken up on the first topic.
He would have made New York a “refuge for the clandestines,” Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say that his own house was a hole for clandestines," Giuliani replied and blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for employing papers-free immigrants.
Candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base has no official favourites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via Youtube are barely more than breathers.
"It is with this kind of isolation that we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also given the lesson vigorously by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where it is simulated drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are rejected, the applause runs into the auditorium.
This is where we find the weaknesses of the two favourites.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney says and apologizes to the base and the television audience for being in 1994 still a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a flowing nod when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as the head of the army, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of army domination ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his position as head of the army to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus fell to international pressure, including the U.S. pressure.
Eight years after taking power by a putch without a bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as the head of civil state.
By this withdrawal from the position of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state that Musharraf declared on 3 November.
Shortly after his infiltration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will meet another requirement from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from its ranges, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Fathers of Krautrock are back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s rejoice: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were released.
At that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced in the evening poster.
Everyone has his small box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old man with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to trouble the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group again plays has secured some emotions among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasoned in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so durable that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the Germans not also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the 1970s?
Especially because what is erroneously called "Krautrock" has increasingly fallen in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the room the questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu! groups in the panegyric praise, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the power of impact that felt was much lower than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the caves below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly disappointed in Kraftwerk and had finally become a guitarist with Neu!, who at the time was the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Instead, an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called there was in the rubbish a fanion of the choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many keeps Harmonia far from that.
The first album was "Musik von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
For as quiet and modic as music sounded, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood did not serve itself in search of itself.
The recent CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esoterism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanimated in the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmonia ever had.
Griessem’s Live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set its goal to maintain the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
New! had already been deterred at this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
Through which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be cerned toward future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled with Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase plays in the room in the middle of unique sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazar-cable tools serve to the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improving.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and to the battery, to pull out the instruments of unheard sounds through the instruments with effects built by themselves.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
Three of them are big technicians.
Even the coral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, you toss and chuchot under the cloud of sounds, and you sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatoires (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams “68” is not completely wrong, and Harmonia is also now not allowed to be irritated by it.
But what goes most of itself will be closely covered on the scene.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can touch on someone’s nerves or give a lot of time of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace", two films discuss the Balkan War again.
But the two do not convince.
Whether the projects rely too much on action and on foolish shoot exchanges or, on the contrary, they are too laughing.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, but that’s exactly where, in the worst backland of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had in the last place lost from sight the most beautiful man of the eighty, because too many gentle and foolish roles in women’s feelings films and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism rejoiced him with the desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch yet "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunt (why today's films must be as long and confused as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He brings a magnificent representation full of clins of eyes: in the bottom, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin at his fall, has yet kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Killer Peace", which also releases this week, the endless sequence of missing films about the Balkan War.
The film tells about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian from the Kosovo French shooters, in which one of the two falls still soon in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV film is lost too quickly in the action and the exchanges of foolish shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the doll", might have become, together with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look striking: two men go in small teams in the forest, to accomplish something that the soldiers cannot do and for both men, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of “The Hunting Party” is that we simply don’t let Simon Hunt be the desert cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must attribute him in addition a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: capturing the war criminal and leaving him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court should be prosecuted for crime against the film logic.
In this case, the film has a too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agree) not conduct the hunting in a sufficiently intense way due to secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the evil are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to the idea.
He talks about a wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the front swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which indicate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
It can be added: there have never been good movies about South Africa yet.
What's worth every time: when a star pulls on a crisis home or on a mining field, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "The Schindler's List".
Some movies still have to mature - those that are worth today of Vietnam's classic works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have under no circumstances been unanimously celebrated at their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know too simply too much about the conflicts in the world, where each hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that pleased the writers the lack of scrupules they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The dictator” have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and the War of the Balkans, he replied: "It depends only on the fact that some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrible way, and war will always rule in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticized the cancellation of the Olympics.
The Mayor's retreat with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has hit politics and economy with virulents of criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in evaluating chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy."
Recently, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this goal, the political and sports impulse could not have beenined in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz calls on the Senate not to buri the project, but to find a new starting point for the longer term, “which takes as a starting point another modified agenda.”
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were irrealistic at least until 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides on a candidacy for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports,” Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation early December, about Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time period we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg would no longer want to submit its candidacy for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to close an opportunity, by buriing the projects already now,” said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renounce of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements of the Senate head on the occasion of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport’s plenary assembly.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport first in the past weeks named Hamburg as the candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor accused the Senate of not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have put exclusively on the "event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg broke against Leipzig.
It’s not Warhol’s boxes.
Whoever connects the concepts of Sweden and wood box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or if so?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxs by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today ends to a disappointing result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is overwhelmed, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
A exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo carton-made boxes: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were directly delivered from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not artwork here, but rather their patterns, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today about about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would be entering the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes authorized by Andy Warhol, with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have ceded him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and poncated, then applied with a pince of the paint with white oil.
The texture of the copies that date from the 1990s, on the contrary, reveals that the paint was directly applied without layer of background on stratified panels, using a paint roll - in addition, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo-Boxes,” says director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: “If the ‘Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board’ in New York does not make another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material.”
Also in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the “hard accusations” that will be raised in the case of powder soap boxes.
From then on, there was an inexorable silence.
The rebels of Manille are leaving
In the Philippines, the rebels are leaving, the same who had pulled out in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers who were faithful to the power had recently attacked the hotel with the help of tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been shut down in the building for hours.
Approximately half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday due to a missing putsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 supporters.
Military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted for him and joined his mutinery.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops at the power closed the sector around the respectable hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of the soldiers.
“People have enough of it,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commandered the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said other units of the army wanted to join the march soon.
The criticism of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by corruption accusations.
Manille’s financial district has since 2003 been the theater of the attempt of mutinery of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts of putsh against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the social capital would be held.
We had already been speculating about a ransom.
The option would remain open to further increase the participation in Versatel.
With this step we are seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet.
Just before, suppositions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third part, it is said on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a share of 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed on the stock market 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
Moreover, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We’re strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
Both companies founded the participating MSP company in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
Currently, the two companies want to be satisfied with their 10 percent share in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to donate an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all the options open, especially to increase the participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still hardly predictable on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had so far a direct share in Freenet of 6,01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent extra.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
