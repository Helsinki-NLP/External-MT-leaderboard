Food has been the main driver of European inflation
The acceleration in inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
November's price increases were higher than expected in 13 euro area countries, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the EU statistics office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast gave only a 3 percent chance, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the key interest rate, saying that a reduction would lead to an inflationary spiral with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2%.
One analyst says the ECB is in the 22nd trap: "to talk down" inflation so that it does not have to act on it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent is a 12-year high; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Eurozone inflation was driven by soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures have risen 88 percent, and soybean prices have also reached their highest level since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
The world market price of oil has risen 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold was worth nearly $100.
The ECB forecasts that inflation will jump from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect 12-month inflation to remain at around 3 percent for the next three to four months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's support base, after a long stagnation, had grown significantly by early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup had never measured such low socialist support before, at 13 percent.
The difference between the two parties would be more than two-thirds (71%) support for the MSZP, compared to one-fifth (20%) support for the MSZP, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold, according to the survey: they have 2% of the total population support.
Among the voters who are sure to vote, there are one percent more supporters of both camps.
Economic sentiment has deteriorated to its previous low, at an unprecedented level, with 41 percent expressing a very bad view of the country's economic situation, while another 46 percent said it was quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the more hopeful prospects of spring and summer.
For the next year, most of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more people than in any previous Gallup poll, 71 percent, thought the prime minister was doing his job worse than he was doing it better.
In Gyurcsány Ferenc 13 percent of respondents trust or very trust, while in Orbán Viktor 38 percent of supporters.
The Prime Minister is not trusted by 54% of the population, the Fidesz president by 27%.
One indicator of the political situation is the extent to which the majority of the population believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 percent of the population wanted the government and the prime minister to stay, now that figure is down to 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) see new elections as the only solution.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about their intention to participate say that they would certainly go, and another 20 percent say that they would probably go.
By comparison, a "parliamentary election on Sunday" would have only 55 percent certainty and another 15 percent likelihood of participation.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition, 79 percent to visitation fees, and 84 percent to hospital bills.
If we look at the same percentages only among those who promised to vote, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would oppose the introduction of tuition, visiting fees and hospital allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth higher than Tesco
In the Budapest trade triangle, hypermarkets have maintained an average price increase of 16 percent over the past year, with the difference that VAT has not increased this year.
The article in the daily economy
This year, the average daily Christmas basket in the Budapest shopping triangle has increased by 16 percent, but the value of the basket has increased by more than a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Since prices in grocery stores had already "flown up" in December last year, the percentage increase in prices was no longer drastic compared with the previous high base.
But it is obviously frightening to consumers that what they could get for a mere nine thousand forints last year they cannot get for ten thousand now.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 forints with at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was HUF 10 573.
(In 2003, the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the price of turkey fillets, nuts and poppies also rose sharply.
The KSH data followed the prices of flour and bread in the stores, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not push the price of the product below HUF 200.
Also surprising in this store was that the price of a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was under $200, so the product was only $257 including the deposit.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
We estimate that Cora 15 and Tesco and Auchan have increased their daily basket prices by about 18-18% compared to last year's Christmas prices.
Comparing the highest and lowest basket values last year, the difference was 12 percent, while the lowest and highest basket values increased by 21 percent.
The average increase in forints was 1,480.
Last year, the average price increase was 1206 forints, so last Christmas the VAT increase had an effect on prices.
This process was the one that disrupted trade, and apparently stores could not decide how much margin to apply to each product, because they could not calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product, he can make a big profit on the traffic-adjusted margin.)
Last year, the price of the daily basket rose so sharply because of VAT that the most expensive basket was 1720 forints more than the value in 2006, while the cheapest basket was only 844 forints more expensive.
This year, the most expensive one was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1284 forints.
The two Christmas seasons combined have seen catastrophic price increases, with daily consumer goods rising more than 30 percent in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily support the figures for the CFP: the statistical office has measured price increases of more than 30% over 12 months for some basic foods.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs are also used.)
According to the daily, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since last year the price level of the already quite expensive product produced a price increase of barely more than 10 percent in the worst case compared to the base.
Flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, having managed to outpace the drastic price increase on multicultural markets.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hyper's don't complain, they keep reporting good years.
In our experience, in the three stores visited, most customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy in bulk, they go platinum on durable food.
On Wednesday morning, lines at the cash registers in all three stores were filled with visitors.
But we know that in rural areas, traffic is lower, and more companies complain to research companies that even their plans are falling behind in revenue, not only for food but also for durable consumer goods.
Many places are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to the improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding, and overwork of staff do not help to stop infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many places are also saving on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department at St. John's Hospital.
A man who was in a serious accident has been shown to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient has been isolated.
A similar infection occurred here earlier this year.
A seriously injured car accident survivor was discharged from the hospital, but soon afterward he returned with an MRSA infection, and an important surgery was not performed because of the bacteria in his system.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by MDR-CoVs have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that this number of infections caused by MDR-CoVs are definitely registered in hospitals, and the rest are unknown.
About two thirds of the infections (683) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried in the nose by one third of people without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are curable.
However, when antibiotics are used in excess or inadequately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In particular, temporary or permanent immune system failure can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, in weakened, elderly, or underweight patients.
According to the medical director of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing unusual about MRSA infection, as such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the common cold, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where they do not test for the presence of the pathogen.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate such patients, the nursing staff provides rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are screened for MRSA, but this does not always prevent infection.
It's not fashion to sample
The vast majority of MRSA hospital infections are preventable, but current hospital conditions and conditions at home are not conducive to preventing the development and spread of MDR-TBs, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is typically found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients who are admitted and isolate patients with MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies also plays a role.
Most cases are detected when a patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief medical officer of the Epidemiological Center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are national guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and conditions.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but this is not always followed by hospitals.
Microbiological samples are even less common in outpatient and primary care, said Böröcz Karolina.
They Save on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through the transmission of healthcare professionals.
So there's a huge role for hand washing, gloves, wearing masks, but there are also major gaps in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection, contact, but in home hospital conditions, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, hospital wards are often overcrowded, with beds often very close together, even though epidemiologically speaking, patients should be at least five feet [1.5 m] apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz noted, hospitals in disadvantaged financial situations also have a low cost of disinfectants, few nurses, and many patients, making them even more likely to develop infections.
Karolina Böröcz says that where appropriate precautions are taken, fewer cases of such infections are detected or the spread of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so they're fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has included prevention and reduction of MRSA in its programme.
The programme appears to be a success, with reported data showing a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has priorities to prevent the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the District XXII police captain has been prepared.
It is unlikely that the retired XXII District Police Captain was driving drunk or intoxicated when he hit a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, Morvai Attila, spokesman for the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office, said Friday after the expert opinion was prepared.
The expert opinion confirmed the preliminary findings, which had already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then-head of the XXII District Police Station drove his car into a curve in the XXII District Kossuth Lajos Street on Tuesday, hitting a 55-year-old man who was crossing the road in front of him, not at the designated pedestrian crossing.
(The latter, that is, the pedestrian not crossing the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance under the CRESZ rules, and the driver in a corner must still have priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
The district police chief has resigned and requested to be placed on administrative leave, police said because he was so shocked by the incident.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three loan framework agreements worth a total of €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed with Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million budgetary envelope for Hungarian financing of transport and environmental projects supported by the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which EUR 100 million has already been contracted for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also provides budgetary financing for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining EUR 150 million available for use later, by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a EUR 50 million contract, which is mainly used by the budget for a research and development project at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4th Metro.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The EIB shall provide loans at a rate of interest at EURIBOR, with an eight-year grace period and without a provisioning fee.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all European attention is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's still cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The hottest destination for property purchases in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains, the most fashionable are the areas of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach, Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshine Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the Kavarna and Balchik areas.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract investors - Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will buy in the particularly cheap Rusz area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golfing paradises, becoming a top destination in the summer and winter seasons as well as the other two.
Forward-looking investors are already buying big, for example in the Banszko area.
Analysts say that buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, and the Black Sea and ski resorts have traditionally been very popular with Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties for between €50,000 and €100,000, or demolished old houses for €5,000 to $15,000 and then renovate them.
They need good accessibility and communication facilities, and they need to be close to a big city, shops and, in general, the local doctor.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was in the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
Capital real estate prices are continuing to rise as demand increases.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, it has been growing at an annual rate of 21 percent over the past five years.
The rise in property prices is essentially outpacing the rise in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Minister of Environment and Water Affairs Fodor Gábor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiation of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the meeting of the ministers.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out efforts to meet the emissions reduction target set by the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.
This is currently a hotly debated issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently intend to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another major issue at the conference is whether developed countries will commit to reducing emissions and providing both financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
There was even agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be within the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Hungary 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment and Water Affairs Fodor Gábor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate action and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit up to a 30% reduction if other major developed regions and developing countries are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Mr Fodor Gábor pointed out that in 1997 the countries acceding to the Kyoto Protocol had set a total reduction target of 5.2%, of which the EU - then 15 Member States - had committed minus 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period 1985-87, which our country will meet. - the press release of the Ministry of Environmental Protection recalls.
The stakes are high in Bali, where a long-term international climate agreement must be agreed within two years, or it will surely be postponed to after 2012, in which case the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by a new international emissions reduction regime, as highlighted in the latest report by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change.
This would delay emissions reductions and make global average temperatures above 2 degrees Celsius inevitable, with what scientists say would be extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
YouTube recruiting for the British army
British Army units are posting footage of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on video sharing to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) has been on YouTube for the first time: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These images, taken with a miniature helmet-mounted camera, are checked by the Air Force's operations command in Kandahar, then sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the citizens.
The political message is inevitable
139 recordings of Air Force soldiers have been posted on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as 'defenceheadquarters' in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos on both the Iraq and Afghanistan operations, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployed in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended the videos to be recruitment material, and the Department of Defense says it's also a good way to educate the public about the true purpose of the military's presence overseas.
Although propaganda in this form costs little compared with traditional television recruitment ads, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, it inevitably carries a political message, as it provides a special form of justification for military action decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army also has a problem with amateur videos, which, in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, also show the deaths of soldiers: the slightly hypocritical "official" propaganda films, where officers talk about the losses but do not show the bloody side of the battle.
There have been a number of videos of the Iraq and Afghanistan theatres leaked online, but the British military has only recently been able to access them.
The Americans are recruiting in a slightly different way, with the free-to-download shooter game called America's Army, in which the player can step directly into the soldiers' skin in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's gonna be a Christmas of bustle and bustle at the ministries.
Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, Monica, doesn't seem too emotional: instead of a Christmas party, she's holding a year-end job fair for her colleagues, who have been thanking her with a potato and coffee since 2007.
There's a ministry where live music is a party, and somewhere else, the toast and the roar of the party is a Christmas spirit for the officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and a coffee table - that's the fun of power.
State agencies are getting ready for Christmas.
The largest departmental Christmas party is being held by the Department of Homeland Security this year, but HM is not expecting departmental employees.
At Orphans' Christmas, children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, at Mission Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving overseas missions are entertained, and a press conference is held.
His wallet is 25 million for the end-of-year mood.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) are out of the question compared to other funds.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and about 350 guests are expected from the 600 ministry employees.
The wallet celebration will insist on the Christmas spirit, but there will be performers and a raffle.
The NFY Christmas party cost 4 700 000 forints and was held at the National Council of Justice (OIT) building on Wednesday - concerts and dinner were also held.
The hall cost one million forints to rent, the rest being spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We know that one of the NRP's departments is also officially hosting another Christmas celebration, organised by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
The building of the Violin Theatre was rented for this purpose.
The information at MAG Zrt. was not confirmed as we could not reach the person responsible.
I don't need a suit.
The ILO building hosted not only the NIS but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which held a Luca Day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money to use the ILO halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's welcoming speech, and after dinner, we danced to live music.
The [original] question was answered by saying that the ball was not required to wear a dress or suit.
The puritan party is the purse of health, labor and local government.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a show and celebration for the employees in its own building for 400,000 forints.
But Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, is officially not expecting her staff for a Christmas party, but for a conference at the end of the year.
The press office said that the party will be attended by 180 guests who will only be served coffee and potatoes.
But the troubled Gordon, the Minister of Local Government, will simply be toasting with his staff in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own hall, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees.
For the Christmas party, they allocate 2,500 forints per guest - enough for a swedish bet and a toast.
Since János Veres became minister, every year the employees of the PM have a similar Christmas.
But there will be no party atmosphere, the formality of which will be reinforced not only by the speech of the minister but also by the afternoon's time.
The Agriculture Department is having a New Year's reception on January 20th, and the department's Christmas is off.
The betting is held in the Vajdahunyadvár, the City Hall, and according to the statement of the treasury, they are going to give 1000 forints per 100 guests.
This will be a very simple standing bet, according to the press department, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are authorized.
These annual gatherings begin with a short ministerial welcome and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture have not held any Christmas parties at all, the relevant press offices told [origo].
The cost of the Environmental Treasury's official Christmas was not disclosed in the press department.
More than 400 people were invited to the party at the Industrial Artists Museum.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the National Union of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A protest rally is being held on Saturday, and a strike is set to begin on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as almost all railway traffic will be stopped and the BKV will also go on strike for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, he will give details of the Monday strike organized by the League of Trade Unions in conjunction with the National Union of Trade Unions.
The League-MOSS strike committee will be formed to coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally is being held on Saturday, and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If the bill is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to proceed.
According to the parliament's agenda for Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted on only in the late evening, possibly in the night.
The strike, which begins on Monday, could cause major disruptions to transport: work on the railway will be suspended indefinitely, some of Budapest's public transport may stop in the morning, and more than half of the Volan companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be a half-way street closure in many parts of the country.
The strike was joined by a number of trade unions and NGOs, a list of which is updated regularly on the League's website.
Some organizations have called an indefinite strike, others have called a temporary strike.
As of Thursday afternoon, the MAV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSSSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, even though more and more people are travelling by train as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to the reports so far, from the beginning of the operation until 13 hours, there will be a strike at the BKV, at the Budapest Airport between 7 am and 9 am, a four-hour strike is held by the LIGA Electricity and Heat Industry Unions, a 2- and 2-8-hour strike is called by the Pedagogical Union and the Democratic Pedagogical Union.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide, at alternate times, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) of the SZEF is on a two-hour warning strike.
The League's four main demands are that the government withdraw its proposal for health insurance reform and launch a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is that a new pension calculation method be gradually introduced from next year.
The third is to ensure that the age-restricted pension is available before 2010 for the right jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSV) of the League of Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for the railway wings, waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, have raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The company's "risk warning" stated that the biggest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "with the deterioration of the ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may develop in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this can be attributed to one of the main omissions of Hungarian politicians: "public discussion of the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extreme political groups, who could build a political strategy against Gypsy-Hungarian".
This, they say, deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict.
In addition, the research institute says that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, under the influence of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding the confidence in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
It is recalled that, as part of the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has gained increasing publicity and momentum since autumn 2006, several self-proclaimed 'national self-defense' organisations have been established in Hungary since summer 2007.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as a civil society organization while openly proclaiming that their members are trained - even armed - for defense (disaster response, homeland security, law enforcement) tasks, and also citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, i.e. the state", they added.
They noted that this was done in accordance with a methodology which attempts to disguise different political aspirations as civilians based on the political and partisan divisions in society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association is therefore not only a means of avoiding legal pitfalls in the case of judicial registration of these associations, but also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor for neighbourhood relations as well.
"In recent months, several neighboring states have also referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential threat, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region", they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Eastern and Central Europe, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As noted, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this and decided to form a guard, saying that the organization's purpose was "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, they say, Bulgaria has been plagued by "gypsy terror", but the state has remained passive and indifferent.
The initiative has sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
As reported, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced the creation of their own resistance guards.
Since the Hungarian Guard's functioning so far shows similarities to the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Roma in Hungary will also respond to the threat in a similar way, by organizing their own self-defense.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, told the Telegraph that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they publish their risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is red
In Hungary, the law specifies the days in red letters, and it has become common practice to rearrange the working day around holidays, with fewer days next year.
The EU and the US do not have a uniform celebration.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working days.
The days of rest are usually associated with religious festivals and important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Eve, the last day of the new year and the first day of the new year, both days of work break - the latter just so that the New Year's workers can rest.
We have a total of 11 red letter holidays throughout the year.
National holidays are 15 March and 23 October, commemorating the 1848 revolution, and the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, we celebrate work, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day festivals, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, state, or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become common practice to shift the workday in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red-lettered holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we don't miss work and school on the Saturday before.
The exact time of work on the day immediately before or after the holiday has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and the workers they employ, to civil servants and to those in civil service.
However, it does not affect undertakings and institutions which operate continuously and which, by reason of their function, also operate on days off.
This year, the work schedule changes only around the end of the year holidays: on December 24, life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that most people "slide" or use their saved time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year, we'll have more holidays in the middle and at the end of the week, so there will be fewer workdays than this year.
First, the calendar shifts around Labor Day, then the workers stay home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd will be a day off.
The other transfer is related to the October 23 holiday: on October 18, you will have to work on Saturday instead of Friday the 24th.
The end of the year, however, may well be the year of celebration, for almost everywhere, a nonstop holiday is observed from December 24 onward, even if New Year's Day falls on Wednesday.
Six intimidating little things you can do to piss off your coworkers
E-mails that we forget to send, voice mail that we never get, innocent lies that we barely notice: these color our workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to minor inconveniences or whether you will put on the glove and consciously avoid misunderstandings that irritate others.
I'm giving you tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were wanted from marketing", says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting because of it?
At best, he will apologize and try to make amends, perhaps by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, an apology is the way to go.
Before making embarrassing excuses, it is wise to think about what you can do to cause your colleagues unpleasant moments and to make a conscious effort to avoid doing so.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document or a stationery or your phone and it's nowhere.
Remember yesterday when you put your needle on the table, but it was on its feet this morning?
You might discover a pen you thought was lost on a colleague's desk.
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be rightfully angry at you for taking their property.
Don't put in your pocket any of the office envelopes, post-it notes, because it might be uncomfortable if they run out before your time, and you need them right away.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not make your assumptions about your colleagues' privacy public.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't betray his trust.
Keep your words to yourself and do not discuss them with your colleagues in their absence, even if others know about what your colleague is wearing.
You're reporting sick for no reason?
When you call the office and report sick with a searing headache because you feel unwell or feel that you would rather rest that day, think about the fact that someone else will have to do your work, your urgent tasks, your deadlines.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you will not be in the office the next day or that something will happen that will require you to stay home, let your colleagues and your boss know so that they do not have to face your absence the next day.
Whistling, laughing, calling
You're so busy with your work, but you're so drawn to the laughter of your colleagues?
You inadvertently overheard a phone call that you should have never heard?
Do not disturb your coworkers with honking, singing, loud talking (which you do over their heads), or kicking, constant swearing, loud complaining.
These can all be distracting, even if you are not immersed in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If you're late, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit when you've made a mistake that has caused someone else to be hurt and walk away from the soup.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for the omission.
Are you too comfortable in the office?
Jackets and slippers, comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office.
Don't wear comfortable casual clothes if your job allows it.
Don't be a slut, your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in plain clothes, if your job requires it, neatly, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're not interesting anymore.
Driving in the morning traffic.
The radio sounds a special melody: the sound of a violin, with electronic effects.
I'm turning up the volume.
The music changes its tempo and the bass comes in alongside the previous tone, and then a real jewel, a female chorus joins in.
Zagar's song is Wings of Love on mr2.
For a long time, the domestic music scene didn't indulge us with good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like a whole different jam when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The emergence of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions coming out of the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the picture, and while guitar-driven garage rock is back in fashion, domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Zságer started out in Balazs Pécs, and he played in the Yonderboi band himself, until - perhaps because two trumpets couldn't fit in one box - he went off on his own.
However, her breakthrough came when she was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation.
Initially playing in small clubs, their formations became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine listed their first album in 2002 among the 50 most important country albums and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as the almost unique trendsetters in the country that seem marketable in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course, no one asked them if they wanted to wear the label.
The band responded in the right way, making a new, better record.
The new album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create a continuity with their early years in Pest.
This was one of the lines of an old band from the area.
The airy, flying reference would have been correct, but along with the airiness of the music, the more loud guitar, the influence of rock and roll, now appeared - in keeping with the spirit of the age, the trend.
These songs featured the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working with The Puzzle in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, Mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to evening, began to smuggle into the ears the Wings of Love big-name tunes recorded with six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So, everything is fine?
The news agency asked for Zsager Balas.
hvg.hu: With this new hit, the question now is, how much layering do you have left?
Zsager Balazs: The definition of layering doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music caste; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, meaningless, and also just made for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop can come from a sincere motive.
This is the spirit that guides your hospitality regardless of language or national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
ZS: Overseas, especially in the West, we have a much larger tradition of light music.
Not only do teenagers and 20-year-olds attend concerts there, but older ones too.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music around them, as they see it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
ZS: Of course, it feels good to see more people coming to our shows.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not made for a purpose, but for a reason.
The audience's role is more pronounced in concerts, where the interaction is already in place, but it is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
I've noticed, though, that if you try to please an audience, you're not interesting anymore.
How far do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a solo artist, and he's built his career farther west than we are.
ZS: We're not really following his path, even though sometimes they try to explain it in our music.
We're more like team players, trusting each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to the music of Yonderboi, as many of us had broken away from his band and taken a different path.
The first single from mr2's Petrovic Tops is Wings of Love.
Many of you heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you deliberately open up the more popular style to a wider audience?
ZS: We didn't have any plan to write a hit song and sell the record with it.
This song is about more than that.
We wanted to make it the final album, to try to undo the sound and the harder themes that were on the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them? What was the principle?
ZS: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
And that's when we got the idea to put together this choir of our own country's best-sounding singers.
That's how we formed the six-piece choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which we later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this the song you designed or did the girls make it?
ZS: The song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version, and then when the recording came together, we thought we needed something more for this song.
The chord progression attracted me to my lyrics.
That night, I sang to her the melody that the girls learned later.
It was almost first-hand and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember it was very exciting at the time, but of course, it had to be the Diva.
It wouldn't have worked so well with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, it seemed like the girls were in the background.
There are no solos (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing completely together and they are not louder than the music, so the music is not just accompanying their singing.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
ZS: The reason they were left behind was purely technical.
But it's clear we didn't want to share solo roles.
It's also about letting go of our egos, where we came from, where we're going, and letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the same euphoria we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which ones did you work with the most?
ZS: The music-making process was actually not really about any of that, it was more about mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a competition piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove doesn't work for a long time, and then it just kind of comes back together like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
ZS: It's always changing with the concerts and the release of the album.
Now, Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions because of his inferiority.
He's a crooked swindler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker Societe Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, you lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not without talent, but rather a great player who wanted to catch up with his peers.
Unlike other banks, he was early to recognize the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He has decreased mental capacity", he was told by his superiors who notified the police.
However, as reported by the French newspaper Le Monde, Kerviel's statement shows that at the end of last year he made a profit of EUR 1,6 billion on his business.
The crisis is not just in America
"I was just trying to make money for my bank", he says in his confession.
In the summer, during the American recession, he managed to make half a billion euros.
He saw the opportunity earlier this year.
In February, there were reports of problems with subprime loans to low-income or past-disabled customers.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and bet on a good horse.
Its year-end profit was EUR 1,6 billion.
"I didn't know how to report it when I made the first half billion", admits Kerviel, adding that he kept nothing for himself.
In his statement, he admits to falsifying his reports to keep it from being discovered.
He managed to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his business.
The risk was the gain.
You were afraid it would come out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I had made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them".
Where did you get the will to take that risk?
He's been gradually rising to the top.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale Bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and he became a freelance broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 a year.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"I knew from my first conversation in 2005 that I was being looked at with a bad eye.
"I'm also very proud of my education, my professional and personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after his entry, his first big success came.
He made his money from Allianz shares, because he bet half a billion euros on the fall of those shares in the London bombings.
And that started an avalanche -- he wanted more.
While you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball", he told the cops.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or rather suspected.
"While I was earning money, they closed their eyes".
But a disaster struck earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he was going to take a shower.
When he started work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him a suspect.
"I only took four days off last year.
A broker without a license is a broker who does not want anyone to see his reports", concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance of getting 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with the European Commission, which could provide the Czech Republic with EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) over the coming years.
The Czech Republic has not provided any information on the amount of aid received by the Region.
The regions will benefit from seven operational programmes worth about CZK 125 billion.
Czech companies will be able to benefit from around CZK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion, goes to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year to the tune of CZK 90,8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to acquire resources for innovative enterprises.
Companies should also be able to raise resources to introduce new technologies, to conduct industrial research, but also to introduce more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful of the newly-admitted countries in attracting EU funding to date.
The former president of Nicaragua has been sentenced to 20 years in prison by a court.
On Thursday, Nicaragua's Court of Appeals approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and was placed under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of the Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be returned to prison is unclear, according to the Associated Press.
The president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, said it will be up to the prison administration to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go back to prison.
Four years ago, a court found Alemán to have regularly transferred government funds to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These shell companies and their account numbers were in reality owned by his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was subsequently spent on a foundation set up by Alemán to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was passed.
What's so special about this budget?
This is the first budget prepared by this government, adopted by a majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year, it passed with the support of the Social Democrats last year, because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow the rejection.
Unlike the pre-vote, the loud debate over the no-confidence vote in the government, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, though most influential, piece of legislation.
There's a certain contradiction here.
Every administration begins and ends with a chapter and a budget item, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggles between the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciated in the press, so it gets a lot more media attention.
Political debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments suffered from three shortcomings which the 2008 budget cannot address at once:
The first is the high percentage of the mandatory so-called mandated expenditure law, which includes not only pensions but also social benefits, approved last year by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public financing, i.e. the deficit in the budgets of the municipalities and cities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are a deficit in the city and county budgets.
To raise money for other investments besides taxes, fees, and bank loans, many mayors have unintentionally, often, issued bonds that have disproportionately indebted their townhouses.
In recent years, these debts have been paid off by the massive sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They don't have that kind of resource anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been in a growth phase for some years now, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for his governments to adjust public finances.
Instead, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries, with one or two exceptions, like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed far more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge shame, especially for the previous governments.
We are among the countries least at risk of poverty globally.
This is why there is no need, for example, for huge social programmes which have unfortunately become gigantic in recent years, and which are completely unnecessary.
Although we have managed to eliminate some of the nonsensical populist spending approved before the elections this year, even if we don't push the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then this country will effectively end all politics and whoever governs it will be just bureaucracy.
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that the majority of taxpayers' money is usually spent by the politicians in power as mechanical distributors of pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot therefore be revolutionary, but can only stop normal spending being replaced by entrustment spending.
The planned deficit of 70 billion by 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not squandered everything they could have over the past decade.
If we do not want to see the politicians in power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and calm in preparing further reforms for this not-so-strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and fees.
Only then can a balanced budget be achieved gradually.
Other
The banks are trying to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have decided to work together to combat the crisis in the financial markets.
The financial markets thus receive more than a hundred billion dollars through the stock market.
These exchanges raise the interest rates at which banks are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve puts $40 billion into the stock market and makes another $24 billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated approach to preventing or mitigating the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move should address the economy's biggest problem, the growing shortage of free capital for banks to lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, in a report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumahl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion, primarily in the United States, on unpaid loans.
Analysts are expecting billions more in losses.
"Central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they decide to go this route", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will make loans to their customers more expensive.
This would reduce demand and push the US economy into recession with possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate used for lending in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK also cut interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another rate cut", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central bank action will help avert the crisis because it will not solve the underlying problem, the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
Klaus: The incredible debate of ecologists
Global climate change is a major threat to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
His book, Blue, Not the Green Planet, presented in Vienna, said that the debates among ecologists are incredible.
Klaus said not only was the conference's structure unacceptable, with a peculiar mix of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanied it.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a flurry of words that are substitutes for solutions to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, stressed that his topic was very important to him and that is why he was so committed to it.
He expressed satisfaction that the book would also be published in German, since, as he said, "I often find only caricatures of my opinion".
So now, interested parties can read his unvarnished opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he was not a climatologist, he felt that he had the qualifications to write such a book.
As a scholar with experience in statistics and economics, he was able to monitor and evaluate professional papers.
He concluded his book by asserting that climate change is constant, that it is normal, that there is no universal consensus on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious, that they do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the audience that he was "not against a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't get their driver's license changed
Six hundred thousand drivers were late and unable to change their old license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to request the exchange so the agencies can issue the new license in time for the end of the year.
But the department isn't worried that after the new year, 100,000 drivers will be driving without a valid license.
According to the agencies, the majority of people who don't want to drive anymore don't get their license replaced.
While the streets are showing a sharp drop in interest in license exchange, the capital's offices have been flooded with applications for license exchange, which have seen an increase this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
You'll have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their license.
It takes 20 days to get a new license.
However, a new licence may be applied for with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to change their licence by the end of the year and start driving with an invalid licence will face a penalty from January.
The guilty party must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also settle the breach by agreement.
The penalty for a misdemeanor is 2,500 crowns.
According to the information we've received from the city council, there's a fine for not going anywhere.
I hear you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously urged the authorities to be lenient and impose fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
However, Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the transport ministry, said that the tens of thousands of fines are not a threat to anyone.
He thinks a license is a document that allows people to decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that has to be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should give up their license.
It is recommended that you simply take it to the appropriate office or mail it to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers should also gradually replace other types of licence.
Those with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 can change them for another three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the investigators who collaborated with Berdycch
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konyařík, suspected of being part of the criminal conspiracy of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague ruled in their favor, reducing their sentences to two years each.
The Prague Organized Crime Unit initially threatened detectives with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision is no longer subject to appeal, review can only be sought in the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also a suspect in this case, he is still awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
The District Court found 19 people guilty in January of participating in robberies, of which the Supreme Court heard 16 appeals today.
Most of the defendants have dismissed the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a case of speculation.
According to the Central Czech Senate, the police members, following the agreement with Berdych, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up the individual robberies and helped the gang avoid prosecution.
The gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Konya.
The charges relate to the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
The main cases involved robberies, which often resulted in serious health damage, but also the abuse of official authority and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because police found illegal weapons, steel-cord ammunition, laser-guided missiles or submachine guns during house searches.
The gang claimed to have stolen tens of millions of crowns in the robberies.
The gang of less than 20 members has already been found guilty by the courts in this case of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's inner circle are testifying in court in other cases, some of which have not yet gone to trial.
The trial at first instance has so far been avoided by Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The bill for the child exchange: 12 million.
For the children switched at the maternity ward, the lawyer for families affected, Igor Veleba, is demanding 12 million crowns in pain compensation from the Třebíč hospital plus court costs.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is fundamentally opposed to the proposal.
"We reject such a demand as it is too much", Dostal said after today's hearing.
'In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion prepared by the opponent.
We're going to see if it's even of use.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostal stressed.
He thinks the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonev family wanted a million crowns for every month they spent raising their own biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of an expert review prepared by the Motol University Hospital in Prague, which formed the basis of the compensation negotiations.
The parents of the children suffered varying degrees and depths of emotional damage and stress, according to psychologists and psychiatric experts.
The men were more able to handle the stressful situation, even when they were criticized for not preventing the newborn from changing.
Women are worse at dealing with the trauma of their past and what's happening right now, she summed up.
Veronica and Nikola were switched by nurses at the Třebíč maternity ward on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their birth parents, Nikola and Chermak in Přibyslav, Veronika and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablonow.
The district head of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, at the end of October handed over 100,000 kroner to families to cover their expenses caused by a fault in the Třebíčská hospital, which is managed by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance against damage as required by law.
In case of error, they must consult the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they may ask the founder for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively small amounts of compensation to people, based on tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Polivka lost his kingdom of Valaško.
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
The judge of the Ostrava District Court said that although he first used the title of King Valachi, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor for many years.
Pollivka didn't show up for the hearing today.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team preying on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
He says that when you hear the word Valachi, you think of the actor-comedian.
This is the view shared by Harabiš.
"We've had almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding the money and figuring out the actions", he said.
He says the argument is about money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was a success and that they could benefit from it.
They want to feed off our work", he added.
Profitable business
The court said the name "King Wallachi" was first used by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original student exchange became a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš then based the creation of the Valašsko Kingdom Society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on passports and even offered discounts to their owners when they visited his farm and theatrical performances.
Who's gonna take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself only used the idea that Polívka had made public in the maness for his business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the project of the Kingdom of Wallachia", the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who worked hard on it.
The now-conflicted parties continued to cooperate until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation of Poljevka in Vetin.
Since then, however, disputes have been building up between Polivka and Harabiš, culminating in the pardon of "the forever-elected King Boleslav I".
The leadership of the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šulaková as Queen Mother at Harabiš's initiative.
In 2002, Polívka then filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his associates, which the court rejected today.
It could shed light on the debate over the battle that Harabiš is planning for the throne and the queen.
This fight should make him a new king.
He didn't want to give details or a date.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
This should be something like a Slovak royal funeral.
The king should be elected for a fixed term.
Mr. Polívka is also welcome to apply", added Harabiš.
The test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: prejudices disappear
To be honest, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the go-ahead are not unusual, and the quality of the switching, the driving and the manufacturing are often described as below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is already on the market and is significantly better.
And the van called SW is going one step further, so I'm left with no choice but to think harder.
For example, when I was testing my Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, I complained about the space in the back seat.
This time the complaining is over, because the body of the van means that the six-foot giants are not suffering in this regard.
♪ In a busy world ♪
I can get through the inner space quickly so I don't have to repeat myself.
It's a relatively successful design, where my only complaint is the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, if the car's exterior is that elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the seat being short or the seat being too tight?
The lateral steering is also significantly improved over the 206 model.
As for the space, you can also feel the increase in body size.
In the van, the little area of the head that I mentioned disappears.
I'm going to the trunk.
So the most important thing in this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
I must say that it is very accessible (and thanks to the retractable rear window) and spacious.
The empty spaces are equipped with rubber tanks, which are an ideal compromise.
They're unobstructed, stretchable, and can handle heavier objects.
But let's stick to volume for a while.
This is based on the tables, 428 l in the basic layout, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, it is not the most popular vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is far behind the noticeable 52 litres.
When you go on holiday abroad or when you put in a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would also have to mention the almost perfectly straight floor after the second row backrests are tilted or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was powered by a 1.6-liter, 88-kW four-cylinder, nerve-charged engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like driving a family hatchback.
Quiet, low power and mostly pulling.
Compared to the Škoda equivalent, which often looks like it's been stuffed with rags in its exhaust, I'm happy about that.
The price is a clue
The price of the car is not cheap.
But we must remember that we tested a car with a large interior and a very good engine.
The car with the four-cylinder foreign engine still goes for 329,900 Kč.
The car starts at 410,990 cents, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment tested will be worth an additional 80,000 cents.
Except we had air bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wiper, rear windows with electrical remote controls.
So the car with the tow truck costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but if you factor in the extra equipment on the Fabia, you get a very similar result.
So we're left with the decision to go with the brand.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into British schools
The number of Eastern European children in British schools is increasing, which has raised concerns among local people about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have reported cases of arguments between immigrant and local children escalating into violence.
The problems of integrating Eastern European children are illustrated by a case in the North-East, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Disagreements and quarrels between students are already a feature of the parent-child relationship.
The situation escalated to the point that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman for beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The perp defends himself by saying the boy insulted him with racist slurs.
Police had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"On our way home, a boy got on the bus and started spitting at us.
When I told her to stop, she hit us with apples and peaches and then exposed her naked butt", the mother of the Slovak students wrote in another unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the discussions about Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that tensions are building between locals and immigrants in British schools.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in the UK looking for work.
There are about 30,000 Slovak students in British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, you can have it if you choose right.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fishbowl.
Palm trees and all-inclusive on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or cocktails.
Surfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you can find a more complete and rich list.
But there is one island that offers much more, Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and transshipment point for the goods that the Spanish plundered in the Americas and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. He was a great guy.
Havana was built with tower houses and its wide streets lined with cars that had become cult symbols of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he owned a yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are adorned with the signatures of American show business stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can sign the Bodeguita wall in Havana.
The expensive bar of the Nacional Hotel will mix up any cocktail you want.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s still drive in Havana today, because the once exported cigars and youths have long since rotted in this salty, wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been largely destroyed, there are no colonial monuments in the area as beautiful as this one.
Other places are getting more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides much-needed money, its development has been given a green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba offers another delicacy unique in the world, especially appreciated by train enthusiasts.
Sugarcane from their extensive plantations was transported to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet of engines had not been updated for decades, so they displayed machines that were only seen in museums.
Where should we go?
The most famous places are not avoided by most visitors to Cuba.
So it's not necessary to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the aforementioned Hemingway estate has a museum, and if you love the writer, you should not miss this museum.
The Viñales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba on the west side of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the silt.
Limestone formations, limestone peaks, and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and their hollows have accumulated fertile soil that makes the scattered ridges densely vegetated.
The valley is where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
The final shape can be found at a cigar factory in Havana.
Some of you might find it interesting that it was also where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed.
Other
It's an ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy is embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-too-large city.
Influenced by later French settlers, Spanish colonial architecture has changed little in four centuries.
So remote is Trinidad, between the plains and the sea, that even in the 1950's, there were no roads connecting the area to the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped keep him out.
They didn't build anything, so they didn't tear it down. Everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to spend in Trinidad, it is worth visiting the area's attractions, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
And in the evening, it's good to go to the Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music only goes quiet in the morning.
Other, including fruit
Located in the eastern part of Cuba, this town is considered by some to be the most beautiful.
Surely this opinion is already affected by the journey itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and are through nature that has been hardly affected by human activity.
The eastern landmass of Cuba is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its pristine nature.
It is where the best chocolate is made, the church has a Columbus cross (actually made a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, you can see some tabletop mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
There is much to be said about coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Caridad del Cobra, the patron saint of Cuba, Santeria, an African religion practiced by descendants of former slaves.
Well, as they say, it's better to see it once.
Our allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans claim.
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment also affect the conduct of the US mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the years ahead.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, leaders of countries with units in the south of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
As the Taliban's resistance grows, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination with their allies.
While the United States, with the help of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for increased NATO troop activity this week, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government and enhancing development assistance as a priority.
"The progress in Afghanistan is tangible, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the public to take the lead in further developing the economy and security", British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The U.S. government says the Afghan insurgent activity is the strongest it's been in five years.
Violent incidents increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territories.
However, the United States believes that the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of their troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, troops and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how to achieve them", Gates said.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke in a similar spirit today.
"I'm not happy with what's happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters news agency at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out of the way
There have also been disputes in recent months between the participating countries over whether all allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are in Afghanistan in relatively large numbers.
But they've been deployed in areas where the violence and the fighting is the least, so they're not as high up against us as they are in the south and east of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan journalists are exposed: Germans play while our sons fight", the Sun wrote, accompanied by a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team playing rugby in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will reach one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt at the end of September reached 842.7 billion kroner.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced this plan by CZK 152.8 billion, due to the better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached CZK 842,7 billion at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, it decreased by SEK 13.4 billion from June.
The Ministry of Finance has confirmed the government debt figures for the first half of October.
Each Czech has more debts than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state was in debt for more than 11 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a lower deficit next year, we will not be able to cross the one trillion-crown mark until 2009.
Next year the debt will be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to iHNed.cz.
Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, feels similarly: "We can cross the trillion mark in 2009.
Exactly when depends on the next budget, which is still unknown.
If it turns out that the political situation is changing, politicians are willing to save more, and that could be delayed until 2010.
But I don't expect that change", he said.
Growing Debt
The government debt is the central government debt, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called saleable government debt reached CZK 803,3 billion at the end of September and decreased by CZK 13,7 billion from June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6,5 years.
"The full-year debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is quite a lot for the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20%.
The bad thing is that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than I thought
The financing strategy and the 2007 management of the public debt show that the government planned to borrow CZK 159,2 billion this year.
However, by early December, the Ministry had reduced the plan by CZK 152.8 billion, due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the assumed CZK 91,3 billion.
In addition, the maximum planned resources of the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13,3 billion, a pension reserve of CZK 10 billion, the financing of State bonds of CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1,8 billion.
A teacher is to appear in court today in Khartoum over a teddy bear's name
A Khartoum court sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in prison and deportation on Thursday night for insulting Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of allowing her six- and seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear after Muhammad, a name that Islam forbids depicting the prophet in any way.
Such an act is punishable by flogging.
A 54-year-old British teacher at Khartoum's Unity High School was arrested at her home on Sunday on charges of insulting Islam and rebellion under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after the students' parents made several complaints to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her six- and seven-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in their class.
"The children suggested a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children chose the name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it's also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with a picture of the bear and the words "My name is Mohamed".
The problem is that any depiction of the Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school, said that she knew her well and that the teacher would never do anything that would violate any religious belief.
Many of her students agree, saying that she "treats the children very well" and "never talks about religion in class".
Remember, Mohammed is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of showing respect for the prophet.
But what rules apply to the use of first names?
Can a game be called that?
It's obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna talks on Wednesday.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final meeting between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the breakaway province ended without any agreement on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status", EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult time ahead", he added, stressing the "existence of obvious tensions".
The broadcast ends on December 10th.
On Monday, the mediation troika comprising the European Union, the United States and Russia will make their final visit to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, 90 percent Albanian, may be clear once Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the troika with a new mediation role last August.
The Americans and Europeans believe their mediation task will be completed by December 10.
The Russians, who have already defeated the cause of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, to compromise", Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN rule, the Western powers believe that EU-led independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina has indicated that it is ready to unilaterally declare independence if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement", declared the president of the Independent Province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where "last-chance talks" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
However, he added that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be "a continuation of a past of killing and deportation".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in a region still unstable due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
'For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise,' Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision was solely for the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
'The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say'
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word", adding that the Albanians' unilateral declaration of independence was based on an "agreement" with the Western powers.
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced Tuesday at the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland that Israel and Palestine have finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to begin immediate negotiations to resolve a 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
Bush promised in the presence of the two presidents to support them in every way possible to sign the "deal" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist networks" and Israel must stop its colonization, Bush said, reminding both sides of their commitments to the "peace agenda" adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the goal of the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority-Israel negotiations is "to sign a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, including the core issues".
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were driven from their homes during the 1948 conflict and who lived in the territory of the present-day State of Israel.
Abbas, who is the US president's successor, insisted that future negotiations should be "global and in-depth" and cover all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water and security".
Olmert then promised that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and that he would aim to have them "completed by 2008".
Bush set the goal of a "vision of two states" for Palestinians and Israelis living side by side by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has said it received a promise from Bush to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was seen as a success by Washington) with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan that guarantees peace to Israel in exchange for withdrawal from all Arab territories captured in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is a solution to the history of the Middle East, especially because it grabs the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues", the Saudi prince said in an interview with a Saudi-owned Arabic daily.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the rumor are contradictory.
How did the accident happen?
According to the initial information of the investigation launched by the Inspector General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car passed by Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was on patrol, so it was not involved in any action. It was traveling at 40-50 km/h without a siren", a police source told us.
The two helmetless youths were "driving at high speed" on a green Kawasaki motorcycle "not registered and therefore not suitable for road use" (see below).
"Because of the right-hand rule violation, the motorcycle hit the left side of the police car", says one officer.
The alcohol tests on the passengers in the vehicle were negative.
The impact is strongly indicated by the car's front being crumpled, the windshield cracked into a star shape, and the bumper ripped off.
The Prosecutor of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced in an emergency announcement yesterday morning that she had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Safety Directorate with the investigation, which was launched for "reckless homicide and failure to provide assistance".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the police's responsibility can be excluded.
The prosecutor said that three witnesses to the accident, interviewed on Sunday night, confirmed "the police report that the scooter came relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, a line, no doubt drawn by pedestrians on the road, showed that the two vehicles collided and drove together for a while before the police car failed to stop.
The vehicles were seized for roadworthiness testing.
The two victims were examined yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor spread that the police had left the scene without helping the two young people.
The IGPN is cautious in this regard, but excludes the possibility that the police committed 'any serious error'.
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which will require an even more thorough investigation and increased caution", a police source told the paper.
Libération has interviewed a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows in his apartment faces the scene.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, went down immediately to try to resuscitate them", says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do".
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the young men, and the fourth called".
As tensions mounted among the audience as the desperate situation of the two young men became evident, the arriving police officers drove their colleagues away.
We also know from the witness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police departed".
They also gave him a heart massage, but to no avail.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the youngsters.
The young ones did get help.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
They did everything to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations since General Musarraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
Witnesses said that in the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas used by law enforcement.
They responded by throwing stones at the police, several of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been produced.
Similar incidents occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
They've produced multiple individuals.
In Islamabad, lawyers registered with the Supreme Court called a general strike and protests over the arrest of about 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were also several protests in the central city of Multan and in the northwestern city of Peshawar.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has been backed by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties, whose leader "has urged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who have sworn allegiance to Musarraf".
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
The Court will in the coming days rule on the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by indirect vote on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to step down as army chief to take on the role of civilian president "has been invalidated" after the imposition of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Musarraf was required to remove his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has denied a nationwide rumor that President Musarraf was given a safe house by his deputy general.
More than one third of pregnancies are unplanned
This includes unwanted (24%), improperly planned or not planned at all pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by France's National Institute of Demography (INED), 40 years after the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception was passed.
This includes unwanted (24%), improperly planned or not planned at all pregnancies.
The INED estimates that the various contraceptive methods, such as the pill or the IUD, still fail in 5 to 6 percent of cases.
However, the institute says that the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5 percent of women between the ages of 20 and 44 were taking birth control pills, but today that number is 60 percent.
Today, eight out of every 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth couple of months, plan ahead, and if possible, plan for spring, since that is the best time of year to have a child.
A spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of a broken solar panel essential to the station's scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk was a record in many respects: repairs took a very long time, there was very little time to plan, and it had to be done away from the living quarters with tools "worn" by the astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery, a giant cylindrical module that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to the lab modules.
However, their power supply must be taken care of.
The crew's second task was to move one of the modules that had been on the ISS, which was already powered by 17.5 tons of solar panels, to its final location.
The crew then began to open the module's 250-foot-wide solar arrays.
One of the harmonically folding boards was then broken by a cable about three feet [1 m] long.
To avoid further injury, the board was not opened.
The astronauts were originally tasked with making a control walk off the Discovery spacecraft and then repairing another failed rotor system solar panel, but instead had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt, suspended from a 100-foot robotic arm attached to the station's spacecraft mast.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
He's tall, strong, extremely skilled, muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old medical doctor had to "operate" on the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the area with some "rails".
He was assisted in his work by another "spaceman" who stayed near the safe passageway, as well as by other astronauts inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
His tool, a mini hockey bot insulated against the hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "squeezed" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his teammates to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, then returned to the shuttle Discovery for the week of today to begin their planned return trip home on Wednesday.
The price of EADS shares decreases
EADS' shares fell sharply on the Paris stock exchange after the aircraft and defence equipment manufacturer announced that the delay in developing the A400M would result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2 billion to 1,4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a 4% decrease.
The company had to revise its 2007 operating result forecast because of the delay in developing the A400M engine, which obviously also delayed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the combat transport aircraft, announced in October, 'will cost between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1,4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion will affect Airbus'', the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will have to report new operating profit figures for 2007 next Thursday when it reports its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide further figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay in the preparation of its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating profit fell by 86%, largely due to delays in the development of another programme, the A380, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company had originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The status quo remains
Sunday's election is not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for President Putin's United Russia party.
In this, the Russians' need for stability, for a sort of arbitrary rule, is shown after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the electorate through public television channels, which has been recorded but is still classified.
Putin leads the list of candidates for the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which is expected to win a landslide election.
The behavior of the president at his reception yesterday showed nothing: he was just another crackdown on Western interference, a favorite theme of his campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, free from any violations", he added.
The opposition, however, argues that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they say was used to pressure voters.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov claims that "there was no such dirty election in Russia even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in jail for an unauthorized protest and his lawyer says he is still barred from visiting.
"The Russians still think of themselves as homo sovieticus"
The predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
Who's next in line for President?
The official gazette published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be on March 2, 2008, and candidates can indicate their intention to run until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was re-elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any further.
But there's no other successor in sight.
What role has Putin played since March?
You're going to be prime minister?
Or as the leader of the party of the Almighty United Russia and the parliamentary majority, will he decide on the government and the president?
In any case, the outgoing power will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition.
"Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel in control of their destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, a historian at St. Petersburg University, goes even further: According to his theory, the country became Christian 500 years later than Europe, and thus the development of civil society is lagging behind.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin returned to a paternalistic model that suited the people perfectly, especially since this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation but by a certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman, a fellow at the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "willfully reject personal responsibility", which quickly became apparent after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of United Russia are headed by 65 governors, selected from the leaders of 85 Russian regions.
And the freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public is in favour of stability.
In this spirit, Russians don't vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Cherednychenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
The people in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documents the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, has been made public.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were previously only available for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. only for individual and name-based access to former victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the 11 States managing the archive - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive will allow historians to conduct research "on the health conditions of prisoners, camp residents and forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the release of the documents, as they contain names and therefore confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have been suspected of homosexuality or mental disabilities.
Lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for practical purposes, to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labor and possibly to provide evidence of their internment for compensation.
Bad Arolsen already has more than 300 permanent employees who handle tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive is not considered significant by some in the scientific community.
"These documents contain basically nothing new", declared Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
EU-India free trade agreement to be signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is already approaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath said.
EU foreign ministers approved last April that the European Commission should start negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could be a boost to both sides' economies" and "India could increase its presence in a booming market of 450 million people".
The European Commissioner added that Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India.The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange '€47 billion worth of goods' and '€10 billion worth of services' each year, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week.At the same time, she regretted that bilateral trade 'still has not reached its full potential'.The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday as part of an eight-day diplomatic summit attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Duracadão Barroso, President of the European Commission.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
Answering concerns: the Bank of England is offering £10 billion to the money market for a five-week term.
The Bank of England, seeking to ease concerns about credit conditions, announced on Thursday that it was pumping £10 billion into the money market, with a base rate of 5.75% and an unusual five-week maturity.
"We want to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year and we want banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period.
The bank said it would launch the £10 billion (€14 billion) offer at 12:15 a.m. local time on December 6 at a central bank prime rate with a repayment deadline of January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is normally one week.
The Bank of England added in a press release that it was 'ready to take further steps' to bring interbank lending into line with the central bank's key interest rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has exceeded its level of 18 September, currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has charged a significant penalty interest rate on the sums pumped into the money market, which has deterred banks from using them.
According to the rumour (which is only reinforced by the evolution of the pound against the euro), many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have accessed at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
The UMP and NC refuse to consider the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group abstained on Thursday from discussing the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists included about ten measures adopted by the Socialist Party's national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment bonus, the reintroduction of variable fuel consumption, the introduction of travellers' cheques and a reduction in rents.
With the UMP and NC voting 180 to 115 against the articles, the discussion between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes turned into a sharp exchange of words, was finally interrupted just hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will re-submit all its proposals as part of the amendment to the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about a new music festival in Philadelphia, planned by C3 Presents, but now the event's promoter and organizer has announced that Melvin Benn and his British production company, Festival Republic, are co-hosting the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey.
"We are honored to be working with a man who is pioneering the modern American festival movement", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits music festivals.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival is in the summer, so there's a camping area.
The festival will be held from August 8 to 10 at a private 500-acre site about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he started organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his range with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of 177,500.
C3's Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, adding that his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
"The Philadelphia location has been chosen before, and we've worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to make this festival in the heart of Philadelphia", said Charlie Jones.
"We have been in discussions with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, the political maneuvers of the city government have made the organization a failure", continued Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we're planning a massive festival in another, unique venue, ultimately serving the interests of the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents was revived at Lollapalooza 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after having already proven its exceptional festival organizing talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The two events had a gross revenue of $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007 respectively.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on a rural festival, whereas ours are usually held in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine the two models and create both the European rural feel and the urban feel that you get in America".
Vineland is located approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
While it does not give details of the agreement, it does say that 'the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in an event of this size in a venue that will hopefully be home to the festival for a long time'.
Charlie Jones said the festival would be "huge" in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the 80,000-seat capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennesse.
The bands have already received invitations to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press conference.
"Vineland will be basically a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of music to suit everyone", says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, co-founded C3, which won "Best Independent Event Planner" at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is up against the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you're up against the Terminator...
"Seduction" is one of the duties of the Montreal envoy.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the shooting of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to take on the Terminator Governor?
"We have to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best location for it.
If he finds Montreal's conditions favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions for them to choose us", says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to promote and promote as many Quebec films as possible at all American film festivals, whether it be the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco film festivals.
The film "Age of Darkness" was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's also going to be screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market?
With just five weeks to go before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the end of the regular fiscal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, 'statistically speaking, the stock market is generally positive in December.
However, forecasts based on purely statistical data are not necessarily correct and the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term, in the current situation.'
The experts are far from in favour of the stock market's year-end volatility, although they state that 'the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity for investment, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed returns, which are negatively affected by the flight towards quality securities, both in the long and short term'.
The report also highlights the need to ensure that the market is not affected by the current economic climate, which is likely to be a major factor in the downturn in the global economy.
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees, meaning he thinks it would be risky to announce a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not rosy at all".
The Ibex has lost almost 4 percent since its highs on November 8 when it closed at 15,945.7.
Despite all this, not all experts are so far-sighted.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 may close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of wallets and the usual pension fund contributions at that time.
However, the expert adds that this year, the rally is expected to change, as it will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would influence market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and 'therefore we are facing a fall in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news from the USA on the consequences of the credit crisis'.
The analyst is confident that these will be favourable.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the selection of the securities to be used for the calculation of the new maximum allocation.
Solana of Intermoney emphasizes that "this year, the big stocks are in line".
The expert would include the two big banks and some construction companies, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally could also be a positive for the construction companies, if it ever happens.
'ACS has been trying to regain its position for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC will follow suit on this path,' says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert considers that technology companies can also benefit, although they are not very represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, there have only been two December price movements.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets were reeling from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
In the year when the Ibex 35 was revised down by 28.17%, December saw a jump of 6.68%.
It is therefore still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (currently the Ibex is up 8,36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español opens 200 accounts open 12 hours a day, Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the parts of Spain most affected commercially.
The accounts referred to are operated under the name Popular Max and represent a major change for the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group whose branches are open until 8.30 p.m. continuously, and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly indicated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to make a deal with the unions to close 75% of his stores in exchange for opening them up one afternoon, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions to decide whether to join the initiative to promote more favourable opening times.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, SMEs, sole traders and local businesses who shop in these places.
The Bank intends to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months at the above mentioned opening hours, since this is not a new opening hours scheme but a transformation of the existing one.
To this end, the institution is modernising its branches in commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new conception of the character of the branches, a more modern, colourful design.
Angel Rivera, head of commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment, but rather requires more staff, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which will also house the SME-specific workshops, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourable experience
The three branches of Banco Popular Español in Madrid have already implemented the initiative.
Angel Rivero says the experience has been positive.
The election was held in the offices located in Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, and according to Rivero, the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialising in immigration and also have very favourable opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
The units of PopularMax do not follow the BBVA model, with some branches offering a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", Rivero points out.
At present, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones by hiring outside staff.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3's stock market value for the first time.
"We did it".
This is the sentence used yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's advisor in charge, to express his satisfaction at the close of the market when it was revealed that the television station he managed had doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Yet, something overshadowed his joy: "The only pain is that it is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less".
Even so, he stressed that we were "less than" in a weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
That increase puts the annual loss at 15.66 percent.
The company is 52% owned by Mediaset and 13% by Vocento, with a market value of EUR 4,488.88 million according to Bloomberg.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has a 40.5% drop since January, so it was half as much yesterday, 2.193.46 million.
The other listed communications companies are Sogecable, with a value of 3,571 million, Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días), with a value of 2,518,53 million and Vocento, with a value of 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The question is how much we can do in the same market, at what cost, and how that will pay off in terms of viewership.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to become the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant for Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact is realised, the channel's advertising revenues would increase by 3.6% in the current financial year compared to the 965.4 million committed in the 2006 financial year.
Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734,4 million), while the net turnover of the television network increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that gave rise to Telecinco's stock market momentum was its high pay-out so far: in 2006, the company, headed by President Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payment of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be pleased with us this year, as we have already done them a favour by acquiring 33% of Endemol".
Analysts believe that the market is currently characterised by some stagnation.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
They claim that this is due to the estimated decrease in the growth of turnover from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company forecasts that Antena 3's profits will decrease by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: it proposes to purchase both securities, mainly because of their high dividend yield and long-term sustainability potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: considers Telecinco to be more advantageous (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retention) because of its 'multiple attractiveness' and business strengthening.
Three, please.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it proposes under-leveraging because of 'similar risks' (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which took effect on November 1st.
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings, which ended today with the congressional vote approving the Senate amendments, the government has launched a public dialogue on the regulations that will underpin the law, so that both can be implemented before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by the Members of Parliament and the Senators in negotiating and agreeing on the most favourable rules for investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of companies, in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, will allow for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, extending the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new Directive allows the provision of financial advisory services to companies specialising in this field, but also to natural or legal persons, and creates a new form of financial service enterprise (ESIS) in addition to securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, namely financial advisory firms (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of executing transactions involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems for order execution, which compete with the current stock exchange operators.
The Law also requires investment firms to provide market information on the key aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk management practices and to keep records of all transactions carried out to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Committee introduced a number of amendments, most notably treating securitized debt as a "complex" financial instrument because of its high risk to investors, as was the case with the US subprime mortgage.
Secondly, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legally define the activities of those with a degree in economics and business, 30 years after the entry into force in 1977 of the Royal Decree defining the professional functions exclusively available to economists.
The Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent, who works for someone else, does not need a CNMV authorisation and can market products or acquire clients for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 percentage points in November to reach 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat uses to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the price developments in Spain for November.
The publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of their timing and nature.
The preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same calculation method as the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method shall be different for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office emphasises that the provisional indicator is for information purposes only and may therefore differ from the final data to be published on 14 December.
'The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high.'
Pedro Solbes, a government deputy and Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only 'temporary', but at the same time predicted that the price index was expected to remain 'relatively high' in the coming months.
In the halls of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that 'although the indicator is not very favourable', the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same in the monetary union over the past years.
He added that November "brought fewer surprises" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a big increase.
"We expected a value of around 4 percent", the Minister of Economy acknowledged in connection with the data released today.
Virgin wants to raise 42 billion euros over three years through Northern Rock.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to just £12 billion (EUR 16.8 billion) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the Bank of England.
It had a record-breaking deposit of over £25 billion, which has been gradually declining over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank until the crisis is over.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial trading name, Virgin Money, and Virgin will need to acquire about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years to acquire the remaining £18 billion, thereby reaching the £30 billion target.
The group of Richard Branson, a high-profile businessman known in Britain for his high-profile advertising campaigns, plans to spend some 50 million pounds ($70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve this goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted Virgin's offer as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy.
Totana's mayor has been arrested in a suspected corruption case.
Police arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcia, this morning, on suspicion of being involved in a corruption scandal that broke out in the city this week.
In addition, a city clerk and the town's police chief were arrested.
Former city councilor José Martínez Andreo took over from Popular Party deputy Juan Morales in May, who according to official sources interviewed by SER radio channel may be the head of the corruption network.
Police are continuing their investigation at city offices and the city development board and it is not possible that more arrests will be made.
Juan Morales' lawyer has also been investigated as the prime suspect in a corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to SER radio, the lawyer of Juan Morales, a pro-people activist, was arrested as he was leaving Morales with the corruption documents in his bag.
Police sources say the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing a development agreement with a Galician construction company to redevelop 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono will accept the PSOE's nomination in Toledo and the office of President of the Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to fill the post of President of the Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE's organisational secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that "we have to count on the best" in politics and that Bono is "among the best".
He also added that the Manchai politician would "probably" be the Socialist Party's candidate for the post of Parliamentary President if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace current parliamentary president Manuel Marin, who announced on November 15 that he would not run in the next election and would instead give up his political career to fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has been pressuring him to return to politics since he left active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters are aware of who will be the economic vice president in the event of a Socialist victory, the party would like to inform them who will be the president of the Parliament "in the name of transparency".
If Bono is indeed to take office, he wants the Parliament to be "a place of respect and not of insult or shouting" and to be more like a citizen's home.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly, the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Marin for his "excellent work", but did not want to present himself as president already, lest his opponents consider him "superior".
Campaigning for the Climate
Since the climate change movement relentlessly pursues both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who favor political or social struggles, it must be very strong.
It should even have a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero on its side, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that "we must make a new deal with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain's leading position within the Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not tried to avoid this?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish authorities what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will have to change, what individual and societal savings will we expect and what will be the economic consequences?
I mean, who has to make a sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not been given, and will not be given, an explanation for these questions.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change measures, the actual measures, are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient, and costly for both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE's gasoline hike would have meant such unpopularity before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, empty passwords with no real consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, but even embellishes the election rallies and awakens tenderness in us.

Totana's mayor and police chief have been arrested in a suspected corruption case.
Police have arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcia, the pro-populist José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the city secretary and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to City Hall, where he is currently being held with several police officers, many of whom are investigating at the City Development Council and the municipal body in charge of managing industrial and housing developments.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six people last Monday in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in connection with a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were converted into development land to allow the Galician firm Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying commissions to managers during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested but are under investigation, according to the Totana Court No. 1.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
Officials say former Totana mayor Juan Morales, now an independent MP for the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the former mayor's current girlfriend, who lives in the provincial capital of Murcia.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a company also belonging to Nuaria Group through which the bribery was carried out.
The investigation is being carried out by the Local Crime Unit of the Central Operational Unit of the Police, whose members carried out 11 house searches in addition to the arrests, mainly at companies linked to the arrested in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who may have been a mediator in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was redeveloped, doubling the population of the town of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate brokerage, Conycase, in charge of the Car park management of the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and the Plaza Católica Ferdinand in Vigo, Hogartel, specialising in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which specialises in the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

The first.
If you'll excuse me, we'll put aside the Book of the Moon for a moment and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped one.
People, life is always changing.
Of course, anyone can make up their own mind.

Our reporter in Finland found this comment in one of Finland's largest daily newspapers: (surely at the head of the PISA report on the world's literacy), the Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared on November 18th at the same time as Blackburn's book review.
"Philosophical teachings were brought to the public's attention after the tragedy at Jokela High School.
The killer was a graduate student who quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat, the Education Councillor in charge of philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers critically examine Plato's teachings, adding that knowledge of Nietzsche is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy classes of high schools".

A colleague of yours informs us that the Criminal Code contains a violation of Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a misdemeanor punishable by six months to one year.
But stealing a CD worth less than 400 euros in a store is a violation of the law (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1000 in a shop, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still not as high as the penalty for downloading from the internet (Article 234 of the Code).
C. If you steal a car but return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still less than the penalty for downloading it from the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You're less likely to get into a fight than you are to copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass fight, you can be punished with a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while for copying a CD, you can be punished with a sentence of six months to two years
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation.
E. Section 184.2 of the CPC states that sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author's consent is more severely punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone's gotten a lot out of hand.

My family doctor gave me an article about a strange study called "Money causes brain activity, especially when others have less".
So the employees' feelings on payday are dependent on how much everyone else got.
The experiment was done at the University of Bonn, using magnetic resonance imaging, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to the study's author and head of the Neurocognitive Group at the Life& Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, "We measured the strongest activity when the participant answered correctly and the partner was wrong".
The researchers found that when both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but when one of them received double the amount, the activity was also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
The Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's Office of the Hague-based Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
Her term expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bittersweet face because the men responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach to be the title of his documentary film, Carla's List (2006, not yet shown in Spain).
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Motor insurance, which provides protection for the owner of the vehicle against various types of damage, is a significant expense and also depends on several factors such as age, gender, date of licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured and nature of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance policy is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car to buy.
First, we need to know what's going on.
Motor insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement took the form of an insurance contract stipulating that the insurance company would pay compensation in the event of the event of damage in return for a fixed premium.
The premium is basically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of license, marital status, type of car to be insured, use of the car, etc.
Insurance companies determine premiums on the basis of statistics, i.e. the higher the risk of an accident, the higher the premium.
That's why people over 25 or women pay less, because statistics show that they're less at risk because they're more careful.
Similarly, insurance companies have concluded from the data that married people also cause fewer accidents than single people.
Frequency is key for the type of car you use.
More frequent use increases the risk of an accident.
When setting the premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should look carefully to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors to consider when choosing a policy to best suit your insured's needs and provide an acceptable price.
When taking out insurance, people under 25 have to take into account a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and recent driving licences.
While it is ideal to have insurance against all hazards, there are more economical solutions.
More careful drivers can take out a full auto insurance policy, which will protect them from all dangers and will make the price affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
"The amount of premium paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the premium", says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, an online insurance broker in Spain.
Another option is third party extended liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage caused to others but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
That's good advice.
If you are under 25, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, as this will affect your bonus and reduce your future payments.
The bonus is the discount on the basic rate of the insurance company.
The penalty for a loss of the basic tariff is called a malus.
"The amount of the bonus and the bonus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus rate", explains Noguera.
Once they are over 25, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, since the risk of accidents is reduced by experience gained over the years.
We recommend that you take out a full insurance policy.
"Young people are often not yet able to apply their experience properly in an accident, even when driving", says the director of a European insurance company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have overcome the fear of beginners.
If you are already married but have no children, it is best to take out comprehensive insurance, if your financial circumstances allow.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, and therefore the premium they pay is lower.
In this case, it is best to have a full insurance policy (up to EUR 300) or, if you have a higher bonus, to cover damage to another person from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more comfortably, but they also have more purchasing power and can afford to pay more for their own use", says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, full insurance with a deductible (around EUR 150) is recommended, or liability insurance can be added if the bonus is higher.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it provides protection for the owner in the event of accidents but also because it is a big expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance that is tailored to you.
Celtic want to score points in Milan to get into the last eight.
Milan and Celtic will face off at the San Siro on Tuesday to get the points they need to win the Champions League final, giving the Italians the lead and the Scots the chance to qualify.
The Italians have 10 points in total and already in the fifth round they have secured a draw with Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they need one more to keep Shakhtar, who are six points behind, from beating Benfica, who are four points behind.
Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round as Milan will play in Japan for the Club World Cup, where they will attempt to advance to the round of 16 on the 13th.
Group D will be closed earlier than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be a draw, the two teams will be aiming for victory as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic can start from a better place in the round of 8.
Even a defeat for Gordon Strachan's side is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure of that because if there is a draw, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next clash (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night worse for the Scots, who are looking to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the second time in a row after being knocked out by Kaká in extra time after a 0-0 draw last season.
Shakhtar should be the most happy with the Rossoneri win because if they lose, Celtic will be in the last eight and will remain in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in last place and having no chance of staying in the European Championship, can still get third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people came to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 people for the first time since their breakup in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced to be in "great shape" minutes before their show at GM Place in Vancouver.
Some 20,000 people exchanged tickets to attend the concert, which included a video about the band's history of great success in the 1990's.
The band's reunion and tour coincided with the release of a new album in Spain by EMI, which includes the greatest hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five members of the Spice Girls have taken to the stage wearing a bracelet given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the packed arena at GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
At the opening ceremony, Victoria Beckham said that the British soccer star "hasn't seen our performance dress yet, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason the band broke up two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other".
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I could see that people's feelings, the way they felt about the Spice Girls, had changed.
I thought, why not? I'm glad I did now", Chisholm said of the band, which broke up nine years earlier.
She added that in time, "things have settled down and we love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV, the band arrived in Vancouver on a private Virgin Airlines flight.
They were waiting at the airport with a bunch of babysitters.
The five of them have seven children in all.
After the Vancouver show, the band will play in California, USA, and then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They're playing in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears over Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has resumed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be supplied to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) passes through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always a matter of great concern.
Kiev has stated that if Moscow raises the gas price to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
A previous dispute between the two countries last year led to a drop in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns an attempt by the Ukrainian government and Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom to reach an agreement on the gas price that Ukraine will pay to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to implement a 50% price increase on the 2008 agreement with Ukraine for gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts believe that this could mean a 40% price increase for Ukraine for the shipment from Gazprom.
"It is important that we argue in the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit states for natural gas", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters news agency.
'Changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the level of transit costs through Ukraine (and to Western Europe) '.
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a domino effect in exports to Western Europe, which also led to a significant price depression.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the gas supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but much of it remains unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS "is required to check foreign workers"
NHS committees in Scotland should improve their control of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The proposal was made by the Auditor-General, Robert Black, after a foreign doctor was linked in Scotland to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
However, it also identified key controls, which were properly implemented, in its report, through a sample of five health authorities.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Auditor-General checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove into the building's main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors questioned by video link at the Old Bailey in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the UK.
For their staff from overseas countries, the NHS Committees should check before the start of employment whether the workers concerned have the necessary qualifications and experience and are authorised to work in the United Kingdom.
Although Disclosure Scotland is used by the Scottish Health Committees for criminal record verification purposes, the agency is not authorised to obtain information of this nature from outside the UK.
The report by the Auditor-General proposed, inter alia, that the committees introduce a Criminal Records Office guide to facilitate the employer's control processes with the various overseas countries.
"Although we found evidence of such checks in personnel records, they are not regularly carried out", says the report.
Black said that while NHS Scotland has a high standard of its own pre-employment screening process, he added: 'Our report highlights areas for improvement in the system to ensure we have up-to-date information on the number of overseas NHS staff.'
Dr Peter Terry, president of the BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unrealistic" that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
'The report shows that the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,' he added.
According to the Scottish Health Authority, the current number of overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the Auditor-General drew attention to the fact that the figures are likely to be higher, partly because the committees have problems identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in place in the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, the Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the checks of passports, work permits and documents proving professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing a directive and guidance on pre-employment checks on NHS overseas staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I am very pleased that this task has been accomplished following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, would take into account the recommendations in the report and ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire workforce, including overseas workers, reflects best practice.
Joy Division is at the film awards show.
A biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, Control, has swept five awards at the British Independent Film Awards - including best picture.
The award was also given to the lead actor, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before playing Curtis, and to director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
The Best Actress award went to Dame Judi Dench for her thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety Award for bringing British cinema into the international spotlight went to Daniel Craig, who played Bond.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
"Control" follows Curtis' rise from the Joy Division heyday to his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film, which also features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack, cost just £3 million to make.
Dutch photographer Corbijn - who had previously made a name for himself with his cover of U2's "Joshua Tree" - still won two awards; best director and best newcomer director.
Another winner of the ceremony put rock music at the centre of the celebration; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, the lead singer of the Clash, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the mob boss's chauffeur in the David Cronenberg-directed thriller "Killer Promises", set in London.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough-guy roles, has been awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose credits include Scum, The Hunger Games and Sexy Guy, is currently filming Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after his late star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" in 2002.
"People like me have been opened up by the likes of Richard Harris and Albert Finney", Winstone added.
"I feel very fortunate to have met Richard Harris on several occasions.
Richard Harris' style is close to my heart, he was a great actor of his age and I have a great deal of respect for him".
The selection of independent film awards, known as the Bifa, is decided by a panel of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people arrested in connection with a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants affiliated with terrorist cells were arrested for planning an imminent attack on an oil facility and several attacks on church members and security forces.
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter says one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, an eight-member cell led by a resident of foreign nationality is planning an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province.
Following the 2006 Al-Qaeda-led attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia has begun building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to a report quoting the interior minister, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by an illegal border crosser who is "a person specialized in missile launches".
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight shells into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of those arrested were planning to assassinate church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on religious leaders to take tougher action to curb the influx of Saudis into Iraq to join al-Qaeda fighters fighting coalition forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which Saudi hardline Sunnis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda fighters view a significant number of Saudi Arabia's religious leaders as being drawn into the government's policy of supporting the royal family that controls the government.
The group's fighters, encouraged by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's call to target the pro-Western Saudi government, have targeted foreign-inhabited settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made a tremendous effort over the past... five months", an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also involved the capture of a 16-member "media group" in Medina, which was designed to spread "takfiri thinking", the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violent action against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
The arrest also included 32 individuals accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday concluded that Venus may have once provided a pleasant habitat.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet may be more like Earth's odd twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
The two planets are nearly the same size and orbit similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, Venus may have had very similar conditions to Earth, and even habitable conditions.
But with its explosive greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation, and the planet's slower rotation, Venus has taken a very different course.
Today, the planet is covered in water vapor, surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, and devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is beginning to become clear why the climate of Venus differs so greatly from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar in structure.
"Our new data allow us to develop a scenario for how Venus formed billions of years ago when it was still capable of Earth-like habitable conditions.
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Doors wide open
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
The Republican presidential candidates nevertheless agreed to participate in a YouTube-streamed debate in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and sent them to the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday night, November 28th, proved as ridiculous as the one by the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in a debate the other party broadcast on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time were a good reflection of the state of the Republican Party as it heads into next year's election.
It is not yet known exactly how CNN's production managers, who co-funded the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest question round of the first half hour of the debate was on immigration.
That's one of the Republican's favorite topics.
CNN asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if they heard something that was telling them something: the interviewer experienced a strong consensus when candidates spoke out strongly about the issue of borders.
The most vivid and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who was advancing in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries.
Giuliani is trying to change the image that he was given of being too easygoing in his role as mayor of New York City to deal with illegal immigration.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The war of words between the two became particularly intense when the questioner asked about supporting an "amnesty" (which would provide permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as Representative Duncan Hunter of California and Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado - have managed to dig deep into the issue.
And while none of them are considered candidates, their continued success may be explained by the fact that they started to ring the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad agreement among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take a tough line against illegal immigrants.
This theme, along with fears of Chinese toxic games and other concerns from the outside world, helps to obliterate or minimize the divide between libertarians and Christian conservatives within the Republican camp.
When other issues came up, however, the discussion became very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had supported gun control before.
John McCain and Romney had a debate over whether a mock drowning was torture.
Another asked whether the candidates believed all that the Bible says.
On this question, Giuliani stumbled and finally stuck to the view that although he considered the Bible his favorite book, he might not take the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was raised as to whether Jesus supported capital punishment.
In response to expectations, Iowa's top candidate, Mike Huckabee, who credited his victory to his steadfast Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would have enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than he was about running for office.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's vigorous uplift in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul's fundraiser and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at Wednesday's debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a common candidate from among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, we had a candidate who united the party, who delivered a timely and convincing message of victory that proclaimed the greatness of America, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are unpredictable.
Work-related pain
Another gulf lies before Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, this one doesn't seem too spicy.
No one has betrayed his honor, no politician has had his Paris hotel bills exposed, no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had secretly contributed more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) to Britain's ruling Labour Party under the name of others over a period of more than four years and that the party had not reported on it is one of the things that the outcast Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister lost the election and when his statement that the polls had no bearing on the outcome of the election, he thoughtlessly questioned the intellectual capacity of the British people, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, who has been making increasingly witty remarks, has noted, the once-dreaded Brown Stalin has turned into Mr. Bean.
The rescue of the failing Northern Rock Bank has put regulatory weaknesses and judgement gaps in the crossfire.
The sickening proposals to change the tax code have encouraged business interests to unite against the government.
The loss of personal information of 25 million people to the tax authorities has exposed an unimaginable level of administrative malpractice.
Three retired generals have been rioting in the House of Lords to protest cuts to the military budget, saying the position of Home Secretary is a part-time job.
And now here are the secret donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Party secretary general (formerly chief administrative officer) has resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the road to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach a point where control becomes impossible.
People do not like or trust politicians, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their distrust.
But once it becomes clear that the prime minister is unlikely to be able to move things forward, and may not stay in office for long, the suspended mistrust ends: the civil service begins to leak, cabinet ministers get briefed, the press looks for bad news; the government becomes defensive and unable to concentrate.
In some ways, Brown is in a particularly difficult position because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as she wants to deny her relationship with Tony Blair, she was still his right hand.
The problems with Northern Rock and the IRS records, for example, relate to decisions made by Brown during his time as Treasury Secretary.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair's misdeeds - such as the protracted investigation into the link between the "nobility for money" case and political party funding - voters may rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is uncomfortable, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The mishaps committed are not as frightening as those Tories portray.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly implicated.
And the compensation, painful as it may be, is the creation of the trends that Brown-based Stalin has always promised: reliable, solid and somewhat hard-line government.
A good example is the fuss over political donations.
Abrahams, a skeptic who likens his giving to charity, said that he did not want to be public about his good deeds.
Maybe so, but the decision was not his to make.
The law banning the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the public has a right to know who is knocking on the door of the country's rulers.
Watt, who said he knew about Abrahams's move but was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations, as will Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's chief funder, who learned of the confusing donations in October.
But there's no leads to Brown at this point, and there's no indication that he knew about these schemes, not even that the huge payments were made after Brown took office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of his job.
Although he was quick to condemn the party's violations, he weakened his resolve by resorting to familiar means, entrusting the investigation of the case to a committee headed by a retired bishop and a judge, for safety reasons.
In this story, the "lesson to be learned" is not too complicated.
In case of a violation, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown has other things to do, such as appointing the chairman of an independent committee to negotiate administrative rules that has been running without a leader for six months or advancing effective reforms to political party funding.
This would require the hard-line Labour Party to work with the Tories and cut off special financial ties to the unions - that would be a hard barrier for the partisan Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
Polls show the Conservatives are now in a major lead; Brown has two years to win back voters; the only way to win is by impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the secondary mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
If blood gets in the water, sharks will naturally appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is in trouble, predators are focusing on the nation's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that if the mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit, the credit card market could lose as much as $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The write-down rate, which indicates the proportion of non-performing loans, and the default rate, which indicates the proportion of late payments of more than 30 days, have both increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss in its U.S. consumer finance segment last month, in part due to financial weakness of cardholders.
But it's too early to panic.
The rate of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The Moody's default rate of 3,89% for the third quarter is one full percentage point below the historical average.
The decrease in rates is partly due to technical factors.
The change in the US individual insolvency rules in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency filings, but at the same time caused a large loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcies (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, whether or not the total conditions for borrowing deteriorate.
The payment rate, which shows the percentage of monthly consumer repayments, is also solid on the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup, a research firm, estimates that 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing their credit card debt to pay down their mortgages.
However, card issuers primarily monitor cash flows and not asset values, so a fall in house prices does not necessarily change the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even be advantageous for the creditors.
If the property is worth less than the mortgage value, consumers are less incentivised to repay the loan; as a result, the repayment of credit card debt takes priority.
Changes in interest rates or credit limits also allow card issuers to adapt more quickly and flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden price revaluations of the assets.
"It's unlikely that we'll ever wake up to a complete revaluation of loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual downturn is much higher.
If falling housing prices and a slump in credit push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a dire future.
It's worth keeping an eye on those predatory finches.
British bankers pleaded guilty in the Enron case.
On Wednesday, three British bankers who were brought to trial for their role in a fraud involving the name of former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Faston pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to a seven-count fraud charge alleging they collaborated with Fastow in a covert fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers.
Their trial started in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group have become known in Britain during the two-year extradition proceedings.
The investigation into the Enron collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into the bankruptcy of Enron.
The three brokers, dubbed the "NatWest Three", allegedly traveled to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud with Fastow and Fastow's then-right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
Fastow, responsible for orchestrating the numerous frauds that bankrupted Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any stake in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware of the large stake.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
The indictment alleges that Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a $20 million stake in a subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But in reality, the $20 million was in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution believes the bankers made $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others made $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cause the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a Texas prison.
The three Englishmen were released on bail of $1 million each and are in the United States for the duration of the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest American company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks failed to cover up the millions of dollars in debt and the profitable but actually loss-making businesses it had accumulated.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of job losses, a market value of more than $60 billion, and a decline in the value of pension funds of more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving his sentence of more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's charges of conspiracy, fraud and other charges were dropped after his death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
Starting at $54 million, a Rolls-Royce-powered Gulfstream G550 aircraft that flies nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles with a single tank.
But to some wealthy Russians, that is a small amount of money.
"It can hold 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But nobody orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or business executives".
Mr. Fuhrer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Millionaires' Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall outside the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods stalls are being rented at the fair, hoping to appeal to the newly rich Russian public, from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-plated 50-cent refrigerator grilles.
Mr. Fuhrer was watching carefully the bright orange Porsche on display at the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not even close to our products", he said.
"Russia has the second largest market for private jets after the United States".
It seems the Russian capital is swimming in the same money as Dallas did in its heyday, during the oil boom.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were seen as materialistic here", said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi gamblers of the 1970s and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the world's most visible spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold rush.
At another conference in Moscow, organized by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the richest people, there are 53 billionaires in Russia, with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires is 103,000, with a combined net worth of $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an analyst of personal well-being in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 15.8 percent of Russia's population lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, so we are all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing manager at London's David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole was attending the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are impeccably groomed, and men are a real treasure".
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, who were walking around the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I look at the cars and try to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes, and Porsche", said young Yumatova, who was dashing around in her custom-designed dress as if she were used to the ride.
The fair is primarily for the newly rich, brand-oriented Russian shoppers who are willing to walk around a slippery, cipher-decorated venue after hours of traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocketknives, Mövenpick ice cream, regular pool tables, Dubai suites and Gund plush bears at once.
For the average person, the entrance fee is 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at the Royal Delft booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue-tiled imitation of Rembrandt.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the obvious".
Indeed, the vendors here said that for a long time (that's 10-15 years by Russian standards) wealthy Russians have been switching from flashy logos to trivial, limited-edition brands that would not make it to a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire agents, and tourists, filled the hall every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, president of King Koil beds, said that he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, each worth $70,000, with gold-plated hinges.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesman at A1 Moto, which provides high-end cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold a bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury automotive solutions provider, sold three refrigeration grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon, which are similar to chain linkers and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel he made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was covered with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is $22,000.
"A Russian millionaire who wants an ostrich wheel or a picture of his wife's face made of zirconia won't necessarily use these items", Karapetian said.
"Instead, he'll keep them in his garage guarding 30-40 cars".
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a big privilege these days, given the skyrocketing property prices there.
"Whoever bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is now probably a millionaire, if not in cash, but at least on paper", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who are not millionaires could at least give the appearance of wealth in front of the booth of the Alliance Continental Russian asset management company.
The company built four English-style phone booths, which were piled with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to gamble with the money, and many were photographed with their cell phones, either rolling around with lots of money or just pocketing a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", Karyev said.
Surgical malfunction is suspected behind a New Jersey death.
It happened the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance pull up on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived a short time later.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop", said Mr. Livingston, an inspector at the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"I knew then that someone had died".
Authorities have identified the deceased as a 41-year-old woman named Olga Arroyo, who was formerly a senior assistant to the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is underway to determine if the death was caused by an operation performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon at 212 West Scott Avenue, who was not identified by police.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine the cause of Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to high-ranking Newark police officers.
Arroyo, whose voice was familiar to many in the department, had been working as an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking and reliable", McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
He was my janitor.
He was my protector".
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, formerly of the Newark Police Department, now of the Shipper Products Control Board, and left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are working to determine if Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's intervention.
"The odds are stacked against you", Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing".
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. on November
21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and so far the police have revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro had been interviewed by detectives.
The study participants investigate whether any part of the house functioned as a medical orderly.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Castro's home, where a withered rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian was barking from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the basement, in the driveway, was a blue container labeled "Ethyl Vanillin", a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes were hanging upside down from hooks.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the unusual and unruly political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'You better watch out for this and that,'" she recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always in when I left at night.
It was disturbing".
Expectations of Fed rate cuts are driving stock markets around the world into a tailspin
Shares on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after reassuring statements from the vice president of the Federal Reserve raised hopes that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities with further rate cuts.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe have been buoyed by Donald Kohn, a right-hand man to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said executives must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to ongoing financial market turmoil.
In addition to the clear aim of Kohn to calm the markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest had 'partly reversed the market development achieved at the end of September and October'.
It said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as the Fed's readiness to inject fresh capital into US markets or even further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The announcements also reassured Wall Street, which has been hit by a number of recent bad news stories about the U.S. economy, including a record negative number of U.S. home sales.
The side effect of the financial turmoil was reinforced by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to offset losses in the US secondary mortgage sector.
The above measure affects a total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters, which employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 331 points, 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax rose by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Credit market turmoil was renewed after a highly demanded auction organised by the European Central Bank sold three-month-old bonds to European banks at a price of 4.7 percent, a record since April 2001.
With the UK's interbank interest rate, Libor, hitting its highest level since September at 6.59 percent after a steady rise since November 12, the Bank of England is under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to add additional capital to the London financial market.
In England, they want a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
It gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the England team's six-man jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision is no less important?
The latter question is relevant, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors, who is temporarily in charge of this particular task, is assisting head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in the decision-making process and, on the other, because the desk of the English manager, Hugh Morris, is beginning to fill with applications for national or at least one-off selection posts.
The shortest of the two players draws, which does not get the sixth batting spot, but as you know, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell what makes someone reach the top of their profession while someone else can't even get past a lower level.
It is not only cricket that is difficult to select, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to step up?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question can be asked in other areas of life, for example, if you put John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated, business-savvy young leaders, in front of decision-makers, and only one of them has a place.
Who can tell what level a cricketer is without being thrown into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data has a big impact on decision making, but options are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's eye at the right moment in the cricket gate, and a batsman must be given a chance regularly if he wants to become a great player.
It's a lot more complicated to catch the eye of the selectors.
James Anderson, for example, was a better player than most last season, but he's still a sure match for the first Test, despite Stephen Harmison saying he's in good shape and has a very good batting.
Anderson fought his way into the tournament with 32 first-class wickets and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29 home runs, but they both had successful seasons at the highest level, and they hope to have more in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided based on the ratings.
This decision can make or break anyone's career, but it may not have much impact on their future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played every Test and was good with five wickets and 40 runs, but it was the then-emerging Paul Collingwood who became a great and defining Test cricketer who may still be underrated today despite scoring a double century against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their meeting at the Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following their conservative hunches, will vote for Shah's greater experience over Bopara's youthful vitality and dynamism.
There's a case for both.
Shah's brilliant and successful debut in the quarter-finals of the 88th Bombay Test against the seven-year-old Bopara Six, who also excelled in curveball, saw him score 32 first-class centuries.
But the fact that Middlesex player Shah scored just 10 in two quarters in the home Test against the West Indies at Lorda in May and the fact that Vaughan, who was battling for his place in the next game, was immediately opposed by the selectors, seems to have diminished the stamina that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex's universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
On the cricket field, you can't be upset by anything, but he was well described off the field when he fell over in an exhibition with a four-wheeler from the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably some shock, but the first thing he did afterwards was to pick up the phone from Vodafone, which was sponsored by Vodafone, of course, and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, and ask him, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a right-handed batsman with a sliding middle order, a bowling angle that gives him an advantage, and a confident and skilful batting style.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and choosing the right moment is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I would personally give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would provide an outstanding player if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
Buses are taking refugees home to work and fight al-Qaeda.
Yesterday, the first buses arrived from Syria to Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who had run out of money or their visas had expired or who were hoping that the city would be restored to order.
Some of them have returned to fight the soldiers who drove them from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already filled with refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus arrived, several dozen buses full.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he added, referring to the militia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently halting the Shiite army.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from Amariyah, a predominantly Sunni town, returned home with two children after failing to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Neighbors in Amarya's Shiite neighborhood called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of US-backed troops, they had driven al-Qaeda from their stronghold in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a shelling of his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, after he began urging his fellow citizens to fight against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and said they had formed an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my sons.
That's why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke of the peace that had been consolidated in the capital since the entry of American troops and the attraction of armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
But many more have been forced to return home from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced a view widely held among refugees that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to deny refugees visas in order to force them to return.
It is estimated that more than two and a half million people have fled the death squads operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis to allow them to move back home", the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I escaped".
One reason for the easing of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas, while Shia have also been driven out of Sunni-populated areas, and as a result, tensions have eased in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden arrival of refugees will stir up new tensions, possibly leading to more fighting.
Small Saarland - training at all levels
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and its higher education is internationally oriented.
In one area of training, rural Saar people face the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a person outside the Saarland that we are not French", is the self-deprecating slogan on the posters of the smallest federal state's 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even for the sake of tradition.
Saarbrücken University was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can still graduate with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6%.
However, even for those who want to study in the Saarland, the Saarland's colleges and universities are above average attractive - many of them do not have a high school diploma.
"The Saar region is taking advantage of the opportunities for vocational training", explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one fifth of young people are eligible for further education in vocational schools, which is more than seven per cent higher than the federal average in the Saarland.
The combined vocational and higher education options are also well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saar Ministry of Rural Education has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools since the first Pisa study", said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative tests nationwide.
To get kids to start school early, the last year of kindergarten is free, a model that other states have started to copy.
Whether or not this improvement in student performance is lasting will be determined only by future comparative studies.
According to a 2003 Pisa survey, the percentage of students at risk has dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
The Saarland's overall performance, however, did not improve as much as that of the other Länder.
Bavarians are more calculating.
The Saar countrymen are most upset that the Pisa survey does not take foreign language skills into account - otherwise they would be harvesting beans in this area anyway.
The language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in secondary schools, even if the Saarlanders are not French speakers.
Chavez is resetting the clocks.
In the near future, Venezuela's clocks will be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will turn back the clock in the Latin American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez has become the laughing stock in Spain.
According to the official Venezuelan newspaper, a new law moves clocks back four and a half hours from Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American country will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Among other things, the anti-US Chavez justified his decision by saying that the time zones based on whole hours were imposed on the world by the United States.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the severance of ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with the president or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it for my own dignity", said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil-rich nation will vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the controversy was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe's decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela, he voiced his criticism of Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile phone ringtone has been launched in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
The phrase comes from King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Latin American summit was so angered by the constant shouting of a left-wing populist politician that he just cut it off.
In 2007, German wages are threatened with falling
A forecast shows that real wages will fall for German workers this year despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have provided a host of reasons to back up their pessimistic forecast.
The Hans-Bröckler-Stiftung estimates that in 2007 employees may actually be paid less than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage growth, an increase in the general sales tax and a rapid rise in food and energy prices", Gustav Horn, a researcher at the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research, told Bild.
The unemployment insurance system may also impose additional burdens on workers.
In a statement to the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said that in the current situation it was right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Employment Agency must not be put in such a difficult position to turn to the federation for credit or support, a politician from the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the explosion in food and mineral oil prices had led to the highest inflation in 13 years.
In comparison with the previous year, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is Earth's evil twin
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more Earthlike than previously thought: In its atmosphere, the European Venus Express spacecraft has detected lightning strikes, and at its poles, winds like those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have speculated that lightning strikes on Venus.
The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus is transmitted from cloud to cloud at a height of 35 miles [56 km], reports Christopher Russell, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
The famous "soup theory" says that lightning caused life on Earth: The theory is that storms set off reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed, it must have been very early", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
At present, there is little chance of life on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around 100 times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but it is still its twin", Russell said.
The main question for the ESA mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different path of evolution.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the search for Venus, for no probe has been on a mission to find this planet since the early 1990s.
Recent research results, presented in several Nature articles, are proving that Venus is not just unique in the solar system.
"They also indicate that the neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than we first thought", Esa said.
In addition to the already familiar Arctic wind, researchers have discovered an even faster-moving cloudburst in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, says a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has a mass almost equal to that of the earth and is nearly the size of the earth at 7,500 miles [12,100 km] in diameter.
Also called the Morning Star, it takes just 225 days to circle the sun.
However, it orbits its own equator much more slowly, with a Venus day lasting 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit [460°C], coupled with its 92 bar pressure, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water accumulated, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus it was released into the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus, it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Kohler, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, demands an end to the dispute between the parties that erupted over the Dalai Lama's reception in the chancellery office.
He was indirectly critical of the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September election.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called for a grand coalition to end the debate over the Dalai Lama's visit.
"We should not appear to the outside world as a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
Mr Köhler also expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) had received the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the differences between cultures", Köhler stressed.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a delicate foreign policy balance, the president stressed, but he defended Merkel against accusations that the chancellor was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not broken with the traditional one-China policy.
China knows this too", he said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his displeasure at the Dalai Lama's visit and has therefore been the target of attacks within the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the EU's "promotional policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the Chancellery, there was a severe disturbance in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only declined the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also, according to SPIEGEL, froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects European politicians' acceptance of the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, Chinese leader Wen Jiabao said.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words indicate that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China, including other modern provinces.
Schäuble is wary of riots like the ones in France.
Street clashes with police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble is wary of riots like the ones in France.
Every effort must be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior demands.
Barricades are on fire, protesters are firing on police with shotguns: After serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that the social explosives do not build up in our homes and turn violent.
We have to take it seriously", he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not all youths adapt to the rapidly changing social realities.
The federation, the provinces and the communities are currently working intensively to resolve the problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about integrating immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already being seen".
But it's too early to solve the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that the German suburbs did not have the same urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting violent street battles with police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also on fire.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, called on the Federal Government to take greater action on integration.
In the wake of the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
First of all, we should provide more educational places.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective".
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
And many young people from immigrant families don't want to ruin what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns: "We must be vigilant, though".
Young people "must be given the opportunity to get a job and an education as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, the night was quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were on standby, a helicopter patrolled the area with headlights.
The authorities have reported three arrests, as well as several burning garbage cans and a car.
Since the report, a security unit of 1,000 men on a wheel has been keeping the peace.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after her visit to the suburb.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The rubble erupted in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
The prosecutor's office has made preliminary findings that the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young men.
In the kingdom of Angela the Cloud-Weaver
The chancellor's outlandish actions are proof that the coalition is coming to an end and nothing can be expected of her.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After his dismal, content-independent and meaningless speech at the Bundestag general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country whose government it is his business to govern.
He rejected the accusation that Angela Merkel was too focused on foreign policy.
That is provincial, he replied, and in doing so he was only expressing that he did not want to understand what his critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how effective libel is.
Meanwhile, there was no real interest or empathy for the country's problems.
Instead, it's Angela the Clouds: a reality-absorbed politician who takes refuge in foreign policy, and there again, she's only in the shadow of uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: The Heiligendam Resolutions are being praised but not talked about how the country should achieve its climate goals.
As far as self-praise goes, the CDU chairwoman would not have allowed herself such an immodesty two years ago.
Now he's holding on to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This damages his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems rather than words.
But in the realm of Angela the Clouds, domestic problems are secondary.
The problems of child poverty and low-income people?
He's only worth a few sentences.
The frequency of language stumbles when it comes to family support is telling.
Merkel has to insist three times to come up with a sentence that's half as good.
When it comes to specifics, he's stumbling in foreign territory.
The assault department
The Republican presidential debates on YouTube have seen a sharp turnaround between the two frontrunners, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - now they have to contend with an outside candidate.
The tensions between the candidates have already been highlighted on the first issue.
Mitt Romney is blaming his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, for making New York a "safe haven for illegal immigrants".
Contrasting his own grave facts: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", Giuliani retorts, and he vomits in the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as a private citizen.
Candidates are on the run: With the Republican camp still without a single favored candidate, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN as a prime opportunity to undermine their opponent's credibility.
Self-filmed 30-second videos uploaded by Internet users via YouTube are little more than brief summaries.
"This is the kind of isolationism that brought Hitler to power", John McCain murmurs to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the rally demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
That the campaign's major themes have gone beyond the debate over Iraq and torture is evident from the reaction of the St. Petersburg, Florida audience.
There's a lot of applause in the room for praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly apparent.
"I was wrong then", Romney says, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for voting for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is reluctant to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first to rule as a civilian
The day after the army withdrew, Musharraf was elevated to the presidency.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The inauguration of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for another five years in office took place on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in Islamabad, the capital.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his command to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyan, yielding to international pressure from above all the United States.
The former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state after eight years of a bloodless military coup.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf has met a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will soon lift the state of emergency in response to another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf installed in early November after declaring a state of emergency, rejected a protest last week over the president's controversial re-election on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal area of North Waziristan, an attack on a military convoy killed five soldiers and injured four others.
According to the military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of krautrock are back
The three members of the German supergroup Harmonia, who played together in the 1970s, dusted their instruments again for the power of a concert in Berlin.
To celebrate the reunion, we're releasing a cut from their heyday, Live 1974.
They were already well known abroad at that time.
The sensation announced was embodied in the three agreed gentlemen sitting around the dinner table.
Each one has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, in his 63-year-old snow-white shirt, sits in the center.
From left, 57-year-old Michael Rother is escorting a laptop and guitar.
Looking from the audience on the right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curls up and concentrates on the console.
Each one produces some kind of noise, but occasionally a rhythm.
And sometimes, it all comes together as a kind of accidental piece of traditional music.
But it seems that you gentlemen are not particularly bothered by this.
It was a great thrill for Krautrock fans to see Harmonia perform again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has slipped into the collective pop memory, but in no way has it left a lasting mark that this band will be sorely missed after 32 years.
But why can't we celebrate the living legends of the 1970s in Germany?
Especially that what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement to the surviving members of Cologne's Can in 2003, the German pop stars sat in the room with puzzled faces.
When he paid tribute to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and even thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the amazement was boundless.
And then at the shows, Michael Rother would sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
Rejection at home and acceptance abroad are two sides of the same coin.
The only reason the memory is overloaded with Harmonia is because the trio only existed for two years, and during that time, they made far less of an impact than others would later attribute to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with Conrad Schnitzler as artists under the name Cluster.
They started out playing in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-funded record label.
Rother briefly joined Kraftwerk, and along the way he made a name for himself as the guitarist of what was perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu!.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rome, they lived as communal refugees from the city.
It's less ideological than the first commune, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more like idyllic art.
It is said that the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein song garden was pulled from the rubbish and that this is how they found a name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by the Harmony.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is "De Luxe".
Despite their relaxed and modest music, the band suffered from financial need.
The rice collection alone did not guarantee their find.
The CD, "Live 1974", was recorded at a concert in Griessen, in front of a record audience of just under 50 people, so someone remembers.
Forcing Harmony and doing occasional practice was Rother's idea at the time.
To Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their break-up in 1975.
Rother ended up with esotericism and supported himself with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the '80s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album in Griessem is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Greenland label set out to nurture krautrock as a distinctly German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has been excavated, as has Roedelius' solo work.
The Harmony revival will take place at the Berlin House of Cultures.
It's funded by the Worldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British Aboriginal and Krautrock Sampler handbook, is also present.
Also present is the creator of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
All of this roughly outlines the impact of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the void reserved for the Super Team.
Brian Eno's statement echoes through the room, with the most unusual voices: "The only true music, it's the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in a room at a farmhouse.
The projection of additional black and white photos of the cable-stayed equipment will help build legend.
In the lobby, the three veterans are back to improvising.
It simply involves attaching microphones to the organ and drum kit with the intention of extracting previously unheard sounds from the instruments using their own uncapped sound effects.
Today, electronic music seems to be electronic music.
Three, technically proficient negotiator.
Even the home choir won't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and mumble, and in a beautiful part, they sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with emotion.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in music arts colleges (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or just escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68", they're not going down the wrong path, and Harmonia is not going to let that disturb their peace.
Even the most obvious thing is thought through on stage.
Where does the music begin and end?
It can be a nervous wreck or a moment of exceptional good fortune.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
The film "Verdoning" and "Mörderischer Frieden" are two films that deal with the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The underlying thought is either too action-oriented and shooting, or too emotional.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help you with that in "The Charade".
First, the good news: although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian war, that they have found actor Richard Gere once again.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, as his many good-boy-nothing roles in emotional women's films and his many press conferences on Buddhism have even taken our breath away.
And suddenly, Richard Gere is the most compelling argument for maybe watching "The Avengers" after all.
He's a wonderful, smiling character: basically, the war correspondent he portrayed as Simon Hunt is exactly what Gere could have become had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him: a man who has long since left his best years behind, but who still retains much of his former charm as a crumbling monument to his decline.
But the film "Verdoning" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" which also opened this week, despite all this, continue the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" is a story about two German soldiers (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them falls in love with her.
While it is welcome that for once, Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the shallowness of TV movies is too quickly lost in the shooting and action.
It's a Cobra 11 with a war on the side of the highway.
In contrast, the film "Verdad" is an example of why there has not been a single really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who go on the run to find the Serbian war criminal known as "Roka" with a different director, a different writer (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) could have been another "Apocalypse Now" in another era.
The stories have a striking similarity: In both cases, small groups cut down the forest to do what the army cannot - and in both cases, the journey to madness.
One of the reasons "Vengeance" failed is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt, the heart-throb, be the down-to-earth cynic he was at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even has a romantic relationship with a recently murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The "Treason" is finally over when the reporters in the last five minutes of the film, in the form of a fast-paced video, accomplish what NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters have failed to do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohammedan Bosnians for just revenge.
It's so bad that you'd be willing to go to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
But the purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to make a mockery of the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large and accuses the Americans and the French (who are still supposedly exceptionally united) of not pursuing the case intensively enough because of their secret political dealings.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you'll think of a famous Brecht poem.
In it the poet writes of the Asian demon on his desk: "I look with sympathy on his neck the sinking vein that tells me how tiresome it is to be bad".
Movies like "The Avenger" have the same oversized, human-headed masks, but they show how tiring it can be to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan wars.
It was recently reported in the paper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were a disaster.
And I might add, there's not a good movie about South Africa yet.
It's almost always true: When a star wanders the world's crises or minefields, it's like "On the Road to Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "No Limits" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It's possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
It took decades before Hollywood was able to make a good Holocaust film with "Schindler's List".
Some films may still be relevant - the Vietnam War classics, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now", and "Full Metal Jacket", were not universally hailed as masterpieces in their day.
But it's conceivable that today, when all mass murder is being broadcast in real time, right through two screens into our homes, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that deprives the screenwriters of the reality-ignoring skills that would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, "To Be or Not to Be" and "The Dictator" were so successful because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do good to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should embrace the sarcastically distant artistic vision of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in terrible ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is being heavily criticized for cancelling the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from the bid to host the Hamburg Summer Olympics has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue fighting for the water games.
But Von Beus is very wary of the realities of the odds.
The CEO of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the withdrawal "unfavorable for the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has unleashed such a powerful motivational force in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, we would not be able to maintain a steady momentum in sports policy".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to develop a long-term initiative "starting with modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust has maintained his earlier statements that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we have imagined".
But we're not giving up on the dream forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has expressed its regret at von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of bidding for the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to kill an opportunity by burying our plans now", said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the competition is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a meeting of the General German College Sports Association.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the amount of aid granted to the airport.
The College Sports Association just launched Hamburg as a city to bid last week.
The SPD's civic group has accused the Senate of wasting valuable time on the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and left out housing", said two SPD deputies, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD consistently advocated an integrated plan for the Olympic Games and the subsequent residential development of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally emphasised the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics was a sensation in Hamburg at the time.
However, it failed in Hamburg and Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol boxes.
If you think of Sweden and its woods, you're thinking of Ike, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
The wooden boxes now being made in Sweden cast a dark shadow over Warhol's catalogue.
Most of the 94 'Stockholm-type' Brillo Boxes listed here are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, an internal investigation at Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now produced a sobering result: The six Brillo Boxes donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by Pontus Hultén, a former museum director, and most likely a large part of the hundreds of other "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes on the international art market.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial displays.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxait" in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes based on the red, blue, and white design of the "Brillo" soap box.
A 1968 exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet, with Warhol's permission, featured hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These (for cost-saving reasons) did not originate from Warhol, but were shipped directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't artworks, it was their templates, simple exhibits.
However, Warhol granted permission in 1968 for some Brillo woodcuts to be made in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses now speak of fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original Andy Warhol Brillo-Box under the "Stockholm type" designation and have rightfully entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them sold for over $100,000.
The problem, however, was that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden wheels were made and exhibited in Sweden, which he then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 cases were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
But by this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish private boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968, in addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum. The pressed sheets were first ground and sanded, then the white oil paint was brushed.
The structure of the 1990 copies, however, suggests that the paint was applied directly to the cutting board with a paint roller, without a backing - and it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authenticated by the artist and should therefore be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum. "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York decides otherwise, the Moderna Museum will classify the official box in its collection as a copy/exhibition item".
The Authentication Board, of course, announced back in June that it was investigating "serious allegations" about soapbox sales.
But since then, they have been enveloped in relentless silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
The insurgency in the Philippines was started by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
She cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, her manager, Antonio Trillanes, told reporters at the hotel, accusing the president of corruption and election fraud.
Earlier, government troops attacked the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricading themselves in the building for hours.
Half the team went to trial Thursday for the failed 2003 coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly unravel a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police assigned to guard the man apparently switched to him and joined the riot.
The Peninsula Hotel was broken into and then demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyalist units have sealed off the area around the upscale hotel.
The president has called the security cabinet to an emergency meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, the security adviser, condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"They've had enough of people", said Trillanes.
"We're calling on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, formerly the commander of the Scout Rangers elite unit, stated that other units of the army would soon join the march.
Critics of the government have called for a massive protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been dogged by corruption allegations for months.
The Manila financial district was the scene of an attempted riot against Arroyo in 2003 by about 200 members of the military.
The uprising failed after only 24 hours when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet is going to be a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has acquired more than 20% of the shares in the telecommunications company Versatel.
As the company announced Wednesday night, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This represents ownership of 20,05% of the share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing the stake acquired in Versatel remains open.
The move is intended to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation about a possible takeover was raised after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%.
The financial institution holds the stake only to a third party, it has a reputation in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet already owned a meager 10 percent of Drillisch's mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch issued 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of this, United Internet acquired 5,15 million shares for EUR 31,4 million.
In addition, the companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a United-Internet spokesman.
The two companies jointly set up the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies will initially settle for a whopping 10 percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their rights to acquire an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all options open, in particular to increase their stake in Freenet AG, the report says.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The Freenet poker game, which has been around for months and can only be seen on a case-by-case basis, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1,27 million DSL and wired customers.
The holding company formed by United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now, it's been agreed that Drillisch will make another round of four percent.
The agreement on the right to purchase 18,49% of Vatas was concluded in August.
