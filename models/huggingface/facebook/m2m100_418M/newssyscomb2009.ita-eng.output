The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to the first provisional results, to the anticipated parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillating, has suffered severe losses.
On the contrary, the EU Electoral Leader for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten's sub-prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last 2006 elections, but loses 5.5%.
Even worse it went for ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian postwar history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, which caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a remarkable advantage in their preferences to SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them because they drowned the government.
In the early reactions to the results, there were speculations on the possible resignation of the party’s president, Vice-Cancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that it could take place on Monday during the party’s leadership extraordinary call.
This evolution should facilitate the path to the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. to the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the liberals (FPÖ) earlied anticipated 18% and the BZÖ 11% of votes – but the sociodemocratists simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (when the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the Euopean Union.
On this evolution obviously he plays Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Parliament also managed to join the Green Party, which, however, fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If it failed to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegal harvesting scarabies in India, it would, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
The minister mentioned this in New York after the meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't resolve, then you know that there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that the executive power could hardly intrude within the legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed by the accusation and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then he can demand release on caution and wait for judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed the same way during the negotiations.
“I recommend the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to get the grace,” the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the case is to give the convicted the "competent legal support," the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such a support is already providing the Indian part.
“We have the greatest interest inining the best relations that have been delivered for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner he emphasized that the Czech Republic gives great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a deep mistake the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided to answer the question whether he got the promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
“I’ve got relatively many promises,” he just found out.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seafood
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which it is drawn Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent sea ground.
The area is equally large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the United Nations Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His head, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and sometimes adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The sea base is still hiding a unknown world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms so far that they bring within themselves the key to the discovery of the medicine against cancer.
The greatest foundation of the land
Coastal states have begun to pay interest to the submarine territory.
According to the UN Convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they signed an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform which often extends to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
It has an exclusive right on all the resources of the continental platform.
In a short word, the continental platform means that part of the sea background and its underground that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over the 200 sea miles,” Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical and professional assistance.
The Commission has so far addressed 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations have succeeded,” Mikulka added.
Australia’s recent success, which has significantly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the sea base, which was assigned to it last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers therefore more or less six times greater than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits, which will bring you in the future from the seafood, as they are prompted, will be inestimable.
Other countries will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared a common heritage of mankind begins.
No one has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the Marine Fund is not Klondike,” says exaggerating director Mikulka, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally landed and their regime established contractually.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the marine funds today also belong to the Czech Republic.
It divides it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the area of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and a little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is fragmented, it’s almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a wealth of polymetallic agglomerates containing nikel, rubber, kobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Makedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a little potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hosts.
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
The circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages are getting more and more detailed information.
In the rescue operation as the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Internal have participated German special units.
In addition to the military specialists were present on the site the GSG9 units, the federal aviary police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the site.
"We didn't get there fortunately," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and their eight Egyptian accompanyers.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hosts were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible refund payments.
The rescued people arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said, that the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not explained.
In Berlin there was no information, for when they would be returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five vacationers and special units should fly with a Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representation rejects the rescue package.
The first House of Congress has just failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
Dow Jones has fallen down.
With 206 votes against 227, the U.S. House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and top politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program, with which the financial market chaos would have been eliminated.
In a dramatic action the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics from the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged the MPs to consensus, although the plan was impopular.
It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something that has not yet arrived.
As the suffrage was ongoing, the Dow Jones collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the worries of investors was that the state rescue package could fail.
It is repeated before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapse again.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
To ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary that it has the welfare of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of reservations
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the revenue on travel reservations for the next months compared to the previous year has increased significantly – for the winter season even more than 30%.
In addition to the weak sights of conjunction, the desire to travel the Germans standing at an investigation remains solid.
On the reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a 31% revenue plus compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute there are increased reservation rates even for the autumn months.
Therefore, the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be approximately 11%, DRV.
The GfK, which annually analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and sets out statistical forecasts for the entire market.
It will also include travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quota, travel to the United States would be required, the DRV.
The increase in reservations is about a third.
It would also be travel destinations demanded by the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as domestic locations in Germany.
Particularly all-inclusive travel has a high quota, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be “better calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday.”
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded great bookings, so that compared to the previous year you would have again recorded an excess of income – although according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has decreased.
The first time in October
Hits of Ballermann, one-litre bowl beer and vip in Dirndln graffiti.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I have not much in common.
She is a blond, a TV moderator and wears a Dirndl made on measure.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, accompanies us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing against us and taking photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
This is how friends are.
The Dirndl for two money seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the White Salmon Equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dressing until today remains within the limits.
And once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or skin pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything is perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's shell gathers strange sights to the chocolate banana stand.
A monastic makes me notice that I would have slept the grid wrongly: "On the left you are free, on the center you are virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
I put my stick back to the left.
It’s okay,” he said and laughed.
Others make less waste of thin flirting techniques and wear narrow feltro hates, on which he tells "To drunk to get dressed!" and go the naked back against a non-invited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Octoberfest for the first time.
It finds it “gorgeous”, with a strawed “ooooo”..
This tells me, after she was released from her beer bottle from a liter drinked before.
Just next to one of these waters, of which everyone thinks it is a patch.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Other people are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
This is the most important part of the world’s economy, and the most important part of the world’s economy.
The nurses appear every time in the branch – all 4 at a time draw a barrel covered with tent into the tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you return full.
Whoever sits under the telon in this alcohol rate bar in the blood, cannot be seen.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the healthcare providers screams to me and disappears in the baron.
The victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly after.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of driving unattention.
He was released on caution.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to enter the European Union, European powers were desirable to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the ends of the platforms with a tower on each of its angles looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building was slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the roof to the roof, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardator to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this rail that was running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond that which is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany drowned during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relating isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and turned the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news also for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly gone into discharge, largely overcome by history.
But today, this railway break for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the increasing diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
The Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the bed wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the major foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a racing on the trails that produced the cadences from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP's headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-in trade centers and power stores, where managers in business complexes - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
I’m sure I’ve got a blackberry, I’m sure I’ve got a blackberry.
“The goal of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut out of its land.
Now you have to look to the east and the west at the same time.
It was not the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
“But at a certain point,” I ask, “will Turkey be forced to decide?”
“Turkey,” he says, “we don’t want where to face that choice.”
Then he emphasizes a point that almost all of those with whom I have spoken here have recited to memory: the links of it not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, The whole Europe can metaphorically run those railways to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How much would they be surprised to find that the Middle East ambitions of Europe can now be, largely, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least there seemed no doubt about which continent should advance claims on this fascinating country.
Title: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the chore.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth chorus, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under 21 years old, but at the time the Proteus singed its final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty-year-old – we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological be-mutevole) represented the coro's good will and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, whether madrigal or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young chore was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often was Todd told us to “lat the music speak for itself.”
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in music.
So sing it!”
His technique in the use of the backet was absolutely clear and accurate, although never dictatorial or flowered.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it increasingly high.
John Frayn Turner says:
If one had to be named rider an orchestra director would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve attended more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never disagree with one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and humility.
He hated the orchestra directors who, in his words, simply "cavelled around the world one or two well-known battle horses."
So many of us will be missing.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he returned to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman ... studying at the same time for a degree in sciences, one in letters and a PhD."
This comes from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during that period he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the 1950-51 years in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco y vida’, because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that gives a lot of feeling.
He can capture magical moments.”
The second attack on the Honda superhero
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Everything needs to be added to a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, bigger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes the new Jazz will allow sales to increase in the segment.
So, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, supposing a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch officials expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company’s managers predict to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decline of 16%.
Despite the growth in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and it intersect 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the housing interior is also expanded.
This advantage arises on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the baggage capacity – equipped with double background – rises to 399 liters, i.e., 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the Honda Jazz 1.2 baggage capacity is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass – involve an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Moreover, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics include the i-VTEC technology that allows to reduce consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine pair high in all its stages.
The 1.2 litre model enables us to enjoy a power of 90 cv at 6,000 runs with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. at 4 900 runs.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now they are available 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The “Ape Car” to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired itself, this time, to nature, and in particular to bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flying of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the four-zone Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicle of the manufacturer's home.
During the flight, each apple creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing are the composite eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To re-create this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have called a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a board microprocessor that immediately, enables to prevent collision.
“When it detects a barrier, the small robot imitates the movements of a bear and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels in a straight or greater corner to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bear, the robot cannot deviate up or down, and not even in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act starting from these data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of the previous maneuver, for this it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This can be surprising, but we’re not talking about gigabyte of memory, and not even about mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination by avoiding the obstacles on the route.
Treasury before applying for a loan
We must acknowledge that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to possessing a lot of capital to intervene, is not without skill.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging with mutual bankruptcy, they have created a fun and instructive game for the network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the “Hotel of bad credits...” or the problems.
The look of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to encourage you to think not one, but two or even three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It’s more a teenage page than a site for the wide public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, you will see a sleeping room inside the hotel.
It’s always something, because buying a better house doesn’t even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, that will invest nine billion dollars in a share of 21% in the Company, the news came after a net decline of its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the conclusion of a temporary agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of securities by 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a $31.25 conversion price, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per capita, a percentage below its current rate of 28%.
At 17 p.m. the Morgan Stanley title fell from 6.79% to $23,07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition into a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its actions, however making it pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces the greatest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent attitude than previously taken.
The arrangements set on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossal for an amount of $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: “We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will get Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would be translated with an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to turn half of its preferential securities into regular shares within a year if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by the MUFG would enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, to strengthen its budget and to increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide clarifications on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should then set a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" relieved its budget from the end of August.
The last weeks have brought the group to a hard test, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of the risk insurance has suffered an impending.
The price that reflected on Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had saved $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa to Quito on Monday.
Founding the Republic on Socialism in the 21st Century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter to give voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
The mission is carried out since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a base of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the outcome of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a shocking victory of the "yes", ranging it between 63% and 70%.
In addition, Rafael Correa had claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
“The Constitution triumphed gloriously,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, just as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet did.
The vote, which took place quietly according to the U.S. Organization’s election observation mission, was based on a 444 points text to consolidate the “new socialism” defended by the president.
This draft Constitution dedicates the power of the state to the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially of the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who will be elected for two consecutive four-year mandates, to have the possibility to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to resume its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
A Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight accompanyers kidnapped ten days ago.
I am in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanyers held prisoners in the desert for ten days were on Monday afternoon, healthier and saved, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base in Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any press interview, to the Maadi hospital, a residential periphery of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no rescue has been paid "to the kidnappers," said on landing track the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordered with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been packed from one hiding to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before the morning.
"There were shoots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others were fleeing," the official said.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces of the "Lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini emphasized, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we obtained such a result was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces,” he said, without adding further details.
He also refused to pay a refund.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed that it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were and that it had killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and that it had captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to a Darfur rebellion organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement, (SLA_U), statement immediately denied by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
In the first page a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current electoral campaign is focused.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in shadow.
Who will decide to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or to national historical places that make hunger?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we have no real and own laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution to affirm that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of the historical, genealogical, archives and property, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldosers our forgotten remains and tombs.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize a portion of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended in trouble for the first time in Europe because of the American credit market crisis: the three nations will provide €11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level this weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties on which the international financial market has been dealt with for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken on this issue may be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost sell part of its interests, including first all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious institute crises signs had been presented then in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to fail.
The bank’s shares on Friday fell almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the share value has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the group’s total capital value is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s managers this value is not real.
The corporate summit attributes the collapse of Fortis’ shares to the uncertainty of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the title slowly rises.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the bank’s new chief executive.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had already previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing the money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not hacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also purchased leasing companies.
The wolf in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies, based on people’s medicine purchase data, often refuse to conclude an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of the prescription data of the drugs depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting the chicken to the wolf" - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick program author to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance fee and the expected figure in case of disasters to the customer’s health status and if they find the risk too high they do not make the insurance.
A long time ago the customer had to submit a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the examination was completed.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacies on what medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program reveals what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers that means that the level of fat in the blood is practically inguredly high and is classified in the highest risk category.
In the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to the paperwork doesn’t stay much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the contrasts is that some medications are used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or heat vampires, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is valid as the risk increase factor, the first two no.
For the request and processing of data, companies are formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, require the patient’s approval.
The authorities are now obliging them to do so even if they have not inflicted fines for negligence.
Some companies have also recently elaborated the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medication consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and at the same time the control of the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers to companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick acknowledges that it is not enough: for this he developed a program that connects the data input with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers will not conclude the contract.
So then at the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemence of the wolf.
The Global Marseille Menu
India and the EU double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that mainly trade with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this topic, along with all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will address first of all the cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union acknowledges the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which it should be given more voice in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the EU's turn president, José Manuel Barroso Commission President and Javier Solana High Foreign Representative received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not a very ambitious step.
As a result, they have unified from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so also air traffic can take the way in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s first trade partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter was condemned in all its form by both parties, and called for the convocation of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the Energy and Climate Programme, which is about to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India is also agreeing on this, as well as the fact that a global deal should be signed at the climate conference scheduled for the next year and cut greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to stop the rise in food prices and have supported the convocation of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will visit the French capital where he is preparing for a bilateral meeting to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission of €20 billion.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.

Previous articleSteve Fossett’s missing billionaire is found
Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert.
The crashes were found on a 3000-metre altitude elevator in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Madera County sheriff, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that still remained: "The aircraft was localized, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is exactly the one on which Steve Fossett was flying the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was sentenced to death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the report was observed, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett landed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a fold.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he was the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he was traveling around the world by air and without a staircase.
There is a number of records, including that he has flighted at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A SUV out of the schemes with an original design and well defined by fixed lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
It’s this, in summary, Glk the last born among the offroad “conflicts” of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a lot of novelty in this industry.
Just for its content outside the traditional canons, the announcement that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next October 17th, will be unexpected and unconventional.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D promotion campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affirmations, articulated in three different stages, which will dominate the central way of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car flies out of the manifesto.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then rest in a single image.
Uncertainly, Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
It will succeed with this formula to stuzz the interest of future buyers?
This is the Italian Hooligan.
Three years later, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls whose whole Italy is now shameful? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" that has been following the Blue National for years and that so far, for the truth, has never created excessive problems.
He never met with the opponents.
The group extraction is right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.

They have three-colored flags where the towns of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were taken away to not be identified.
They are inspired by English Tifoseria.
In Bulgaria they found a typhosery of true Nazis, the Levsky.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those parted for Sofia there was no one with an ongoing Daspo, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previously stadium crimes, had been rejected the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorders.
A international Daspo that prevents visiting not only the Italian stadiums but from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, by the way, will no longer put foot in a stage.
Fortunately it.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than a hundred and fifty, others will be added.
“We have to immediately turn off this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way,” he said.
“It’s a good thing to see, especially in view of the national match on Wednesday in Lecce.”
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
This is the first time I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it, and I’ve been able to do it.
"The Duce-Duce hearts and the tight arm during Mameli's hymn? in Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (ha taken the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a trieste questor where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to blame the Duke but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact occurs.
Until now this group was in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we also talk about the fish to the hymn of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education.
