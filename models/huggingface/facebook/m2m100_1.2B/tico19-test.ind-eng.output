Rapidly increasing incidence of cumulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that, although the degree varies depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic grows very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, clusters of cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology were in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the causative agent of the disease was a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of them recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease and requires hospitalization, while the other 6% of cases develop critical illnesses that require intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients treated in hospitals due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative COVID-19 incidence trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced a further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. the first European with confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Acquire cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases by country around the world is updated daily at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the country, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data are used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare them with trends in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative incidence of 14 days, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present cumulative numbers of cases by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. compared to the case of Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trend in EU/EEA countries and UK
The 14 day cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21, then increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
This trend is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a trend of increasing similar cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additives).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, by March 15 at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is regardless of differences in levels experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols to select patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
By early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on receipt of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EEA level is only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and death rates.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed large variations in terms of availability of intensive care beds and madya care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds of intensive care and madya care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
A modeling scenario related to the saturation of health care capacity, with an estimated prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases for each EU/EEA and UK country associated with a risk >90% exceeding the intensive care bed capacity, is provided in the ECDC’s sixth update of the rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far cases are clustered in specific regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a population of specific regional service coverage, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the NUTS-2 level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a restrictive approach to a mitigating approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, receive, and adapt the appropriate response if it was not implemented earlier.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available as the country has the potential to further enhance its control efforts in slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA health care systems will likely face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters to humans.
Similar to its homologue virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from cockroaches and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and more about the elderly than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this newly emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps to understand and combat this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were ordered to stay at home during the holidays and a few weeks after because of a new outbreak of viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is a “public enemy number one” and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 establishing an isolated virus sequence from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in this fast-growing new subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have found two highly pathogenic CoVs for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a healthcare provider infection was, suggesting that human-to-human transmission could occur.
On January 23, a regional quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical trial on the disease that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation develops very rapidly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still have to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centered study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are older than 50, only a few are under the age of 20, and only 14 are infected who are under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0,31 per 100,000) than women (0,27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 spread in clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from birth to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 is customized 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and custom mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large sample virus subfamily that contains a single string of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
The spike or spike (S) glucoprotein cover binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin-exchanging enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by the glucoprotein cover and the nucleocapsid protein form a vesicle containing virions, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% among 10 sequential samples; the samples were taken from the source site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than its binding to SARS-CoV S protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infection that is not the same as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encrypted with orf3b and proteins secreted with the orf8 password.
The orf3b protein SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is composed forming dimers and the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from frogs and each is transmitted to humans through frogs and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, dwarfs are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs similar to SARS from dwarfs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as virus carriers from dwarfs to humans involving recombination of homologues within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the long-mouthed, ants-eating mammals that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially host SARS-CoV-2 intermediates based on 99% genetic homologies of the CoV found in the mice and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% differences spread throughout the genome are still large differences; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (cf. 3).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, acetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
At present, there are no detailed studies reporting immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr.
Generally, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern identifier receptors (PRR), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferon (IFN), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of the virus antigen by the macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon after, the adaptive immune response joined the battle against this virus.
The T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
Assistant T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies, is also important in combating viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large amount of locally free radicals, which can lead to severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, organ cluster failure and even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by an awitan cluster, is more likely to affect the elderly with accompanying diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, showed that an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days was based on demographics of 8.866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent an infected person, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to the virus or are infected are usually required to be in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, abscess, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the development of the disease of the patient proceeds rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings have been in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their primary symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are shown as the primary symptoms and ventilation support is required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Clustered clusters are often found in one family or from one group or vehicle such as cruise ships.
Patients often have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the infection.
However, it is that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are returned from the hospital can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <4×109/L, which includes lymphocyt count <1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of some patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and blood absorption rate increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer increase, which is the product of the decomposition of fibrin present in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
Thorax photo abnormalities are found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral or ground-glass shadows in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases the level of surface acts and increases surface pressure, thereby decreasing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on the photo of the thorax are often parallel to the most severe degree of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumocyte desquamation, hyalin membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as numerous syncytial stem cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false negative, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is important and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol of using SHERLOCK-based-CRISPR technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a shellpipe in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoV, doctors primarily offer supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients while trying various therapies that have ever been used or previously suggested for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes existing therapies and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is suggested for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies race to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified short-circuit cardiopulmonary technique used to treat life-threatening heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, care for electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ functions are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to cause cytokine storms in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the degenerative release of a series of cytokines, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is very important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressant 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, the steroid can cause severe side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended to be administered with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be beneficial in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of other single-string RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead supplied the compound to China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicines used by the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibodies
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, recognize the unique molecules in the pathogen, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 patients who were severely ill.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load, as well as an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to apply such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtration to proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of different components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not exist, TCM has become one of the leading alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest healing rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest healing rates (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy course with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom deterioration (from mild to severe) was much lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled testing on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel deeply afraid of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapies such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even concomitability, have ever been.
Contact history tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and a therapeutic plan as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are crucial for breaking the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemics caused by the onset of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a S-protein-based vaccine, which long-term and effectively produces neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-depleted vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this vaccine candidate in vivo in elderly and lethal challenges models as well as its protection against zoonotic virus infection still needs to be determined before clinical trials begin.
It’s likely because SARS has gone away 17 years ago and no new cases have been since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in the endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal experiments.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop vaccines (average 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without a sequel.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 was also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a disease prognosis model is essential for health care bodies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have concomitant and complicated comorbidities and are significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which indicates age as a predictive factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0,31/100,000 versus 0,27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are closely correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlations between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis have also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Photos of thorax and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Uses: As described above, steroids are an immunosuppressant that is widely used as a supportive therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonekrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used at low doses and short-term in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients suffer from extreme stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help the patient recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause a cold.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, an infected patient can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are severely ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is far more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Currently, major efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the measures are severely damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the outbreak will end in March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the end outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian research group that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conca and throat of patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier.
Nevertheless, promising signs are occurring in China, if seen on the basis of a decrease in the number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half of them also deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Per too, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a not very pathogenic virus that can go side by side with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the stools so it creates the possibility of a new transmission, the transmission from stool to mouth.
Recent studies in 138 cases that 41% of cases may be caused by nosokomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who happen to come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series number 1860s) to help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask keeps the splash of a potentially infected person from following the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the splash can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series number of the 1860s) could protect against inhalation of virions with the size as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm in size.
Because the particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series number 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, healthcare providers should wear a suitable insulation jacket to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing the N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a face shield or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended for anyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to keep a distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as on 7 January 2020, must be a major warning for China, which has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control reassured the population by saying that the new virus has low spread characteristics and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and the prevention and prevention of the disease is not a problem.
The message so calmed the public’s fears, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, that this critical time was missed to curb the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to curb the potential epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and test and improve public response systems periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began spreading in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread across China and more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this survey.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has an appearance like a recurring outbreak of SARS.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to curbing the epidemic and dealing with patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and mortality rates are also higher among older people than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10,91% versus 1,44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to block the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can give positive results again to the virus test.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues still have to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two dwarf-like CoV-SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from dwarfs.
Which animal is the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the home of origin, say the frog, to humans?
Without knowing the answers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively disrupt the transmission and the outbreak can spread again at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical models show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and lead to further pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to be able to return to normal life.
The Zoonotic Human Coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as sickness.
Severe outbreaks of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how damaging and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a highlight again and surprised us with its high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoV will be beneficial to us.
Most HCoVs come from cockroaches. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
The host reservoir intermediary of several HCoVs has also been known.
Identification of animal shelters has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-spider interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and species-to-species transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted these HCoVs from the perspective of evolution and recombination of the genomes.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for a successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) is derived from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that are cellulose, positive, and single-cellulose.
The virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobas among the RNA viruses called "CoV", because of its corona-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, the CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar layout.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-read frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into PP1a and PP1ab replication polyprotein.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a spike or spike (S), a blanket or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins that are specific to a particular line of descent are also encoded by different lines of descent of CoV.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genes, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Philogenetic evidence suggests that frogs and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic in nature, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the sick patient’s ingus in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, the concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until an outbreak of SARS occurs.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a brutal death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm has already sounded and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from dwarfs, mice, or pets.
Many evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from cockroaches. In cockroaches, the CoV is well-adapted and is non-pathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
HCoV zoonotic origin tracking provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers, and limiting factors of species-to-species migration.
The study could also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal shelter, mediator, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for future spread prevention.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that the HCoV parent virus is usually non-pathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after transmitting the interspecies to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV that increased transmission abilities are often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the ingus of patients affected by selesma, a variety of CoVs had been isolated from a variety of infected animals, which included turtles, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of a patient with an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of selesma, which include headache, sneezing, sneezing, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10 to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and sequential pathways in the breastfeeding scrotum.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which symptomatically cannot be distinguished from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and are most likely to be transmitted during winter in temperate climatic regions.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild cystitis.
Only a few patients with a weakened immune system indicate an underlying respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-related pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the superinfectious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the viral load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, fainting, and sneezing, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and respiratory impairment as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be deadly, especially in patients whose immunity is weakened.
The virus was first isolated from open lung biopsies of relatives of zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very common in young children, seniors, and patients with weakened immunity who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Pictures of choresis, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the same virus isolation from the nasal samples of 8-month-old boys suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and its peak incidence occurs in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four HCoV communities have fully adapted to humans and generally have a small likelihood of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. Nevertheless, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been to cause severe sub-respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to maintain itself within humans is obtained, virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases come from the Middle East, cases of imports with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which is characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were with high death rates of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients that were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global health emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of gross cases of 3.4%.
It is worth noting, cases deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2%, while cases deaths outside Hubei were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with pictures of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into an acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they both group into different phylogenetic tree branches.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been and may have played a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more commonly seen picture of Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of mild or even symptomless non-specific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like a SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also showed interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities with both community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoV.
On the other hand, a decrease in the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of transmission of SARS-CoV, at least in a particular situation, is still to be clarified by further studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
Anyway, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability to continue transmission, pathogenicity, and spread in several pathways in humans, will have a great impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be species transgressors to an ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes serious diseases in humans and humans with severe HCoV disease, has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient amounts to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations in order to combat the host restriction factor.
Thus, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus fully adapts to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four CoV communities circulated in the human population and triggered selesma in people with immunocompetence.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
Both must defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar picture of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is as easily transmitted as community HCoV, at least nowadays.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not sepatogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animal host or intermediary.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplification host of HCoV.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have close-related ancestors and share high homologies at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral viruses usually adapt well and are non-pathogenic in this hostel.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if new HCoVs entered the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus entered humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and serve as amplification hosts by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can get an outbreak of infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in an intermediate host.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that zero cases of SARS had a history of contact with livestock.
Further studies of seroprevalence indicated that animal sellers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The moonfrog (Paguma larvata) and the rabbit dog in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to the SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been since all the musks in the market were killed.
Despite this, it has been that moonshine from wildlife or farms that are not exposed to the live animal market mostly yielded negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that moonshine may only act as an intermediate amplification host, but not a natural resorvoir for SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammal species also serve as hosts for SARS-CoV intermediate amplification.
All of these hostels appear to be the final host of SARS-CoV.
The search for natural shelters for SARS-CoV subsequently revealed a closely related tortoise CoV, called the Rhinolopus tortoise CoV-SARS-HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horse tapal tortoises.
The species gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This CoV and other dwarf CoV share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study was the foundation for a new concept that frogs are hosts for newly emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from dwarfs, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of butterfly feces was shown to use ACE2 from butterflies, mushrooms, and humans as receptors to enter cells.
Interestingly, serum patients with convalescent SARS can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor to SARS-CoV in cockroaches, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and frogs are not the direct host reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 dwarfs.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the pathway to the virus.
The sequence of MERS-CoV polymerase-dependent RNA is phylogenetically closer to its equivalent in identified beta-CoV dwarfs from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild frogs.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 dwarfs share only 87% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, cockroaches may not be the direct host of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels gave seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to camels originating in some African countries in the Middle East.
MERS-CoV living identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arabian camel nasal vapour. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive virus breakdown with usually mild symptoms was observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels disperse the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral pathway, which is also the main pathway of the virus’s breakdown from cockroaches.
Nevertheless, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly as a result of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 dwarf CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis dwarf.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, dwarfs may not be a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless a identical dwarf CoV is found later on.
Probably, the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 pet is among the wildlife species sold and killed on the Huanan Marine Food Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequence suggest that a small group of endangered mammals, known as trenggiling (Sweet javanica), may also carry beta-CoV ancestors related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new molten CoV genome shares 85-92% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as closely related to RaTG13 with a 90% similarity in the rate of nucleotide sequence.
Both were grouped into two subgarages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Strikingly, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the degree of sequence homology of the entire genome is higher.
Previous studies in sick molluscs also detection of contig virus from a lung sample, which also turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methods of preparation and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of approximately 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We can’t rule out the possibility of mowing as one of the intermediate shelters of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from melting due to sequential differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 melting.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in frogs, frogs, and other mammals is still to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology on RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genome.
It is too speculative to say that the high levels of similarity between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by convergence evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparative hypothesis supports a recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
As a driver of evolution, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
Researchers are still unable to determine the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoV turtles, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It is that the CoV of a butterfly named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color butterflies showed close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to the other dwarf CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also being their own host.
To be clearer, current knowledge about known animal origins of HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
An alpha-CoV that is related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the two, there is alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from cockroaches to humans.
First, humans, not alpaca, may come into contact with dwarves in a shared ecological field.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, dwarf alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E is varied and non-pathogenic in dwarfs, while alpaca alpha-CoV causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpaca gets alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, butterflies are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that dwarves may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Otherwise, while dwarf alpha-CoV serves as a cluster of the HCoV-229E gene, alpaca and Arab camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission from frogs to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origins of MERS-CoV from cockroaches are known at early identification of the virus and are also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that butterflies are virus species that are rich in exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Longevity, tightly structured colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying abilities are all favorable conditions for frogs to become the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been in the Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted with camels that have changed from an intermediate hostel to a stable, natural reservoir hostel.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurred by chance and humans remained the final home for MERS-CoV because its transmission could not continue.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of mowing, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoV grinding is highly pathogenic in grinding.
Melting may be the final host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to moss in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be taken into account or excluded.
First, butterflies could be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological reefs with frogs through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, trenggiling could be one of the intermediate amplification hosts for the newly-entered SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of meat.
Per, many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals must be carried out.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that is in contact with both dwarves and frogs.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the various types of animal shelters, the three main factors on the viral side are also important to facilitate CoV crossing the species barrier.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-vulnerable RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered “sedentary” to “high” with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new host.
CoV has exoribonuclease correction, removal resulting in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than its host mutation rate.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, indicating a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic degeneration will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA genomes in the CoV provide additional flexibility in genomic modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which favors the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by numerous unique open reading frameworks and protein functions that are encrypted towards the ends of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoVs frequently change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique “select-copy” mechanism.
In a dormitory that serves as a mixing container, the switching of the strain frequently occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs may undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Natural recombinant phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoV such as slugs SL-CoV and slugs CoV-HKU9.
Virus-virus interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the host receptor is another major factor affecting the transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission incidents.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and mosquito SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is suspected to have experienced rapid adaptation in various hosts, with mutations in the RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensely becomes the target of the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptor as a virus entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include dwarfs, mushrooms, mice, and dogs, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and mushroom virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them were located in receptor binding patterns for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The SARS-CoV mustard has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the mutant protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be very important for virus adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit imply that the affinity of binding S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding affinity was 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
What is also important to know is whether there are other corresponding receptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teracetylated malic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after species-to-species transmission from their host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecular HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These differences in host protein between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as cockroaches, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to species-to-species transmission.
HCoV must take over the host dependence factor and overcome the host restriction factor in order to succeed in species-to-species transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the field of this important virus-virus interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genome without bias to see SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restriction factors using cutting-edge CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of cockroach CoV provides a great chance for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the cockroach CoV acts as a hone of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and recombinant genes also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes could potentially modify the virus phenotype drastically.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV-related dwarf virus has been found to encrypt a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separated ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lines, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinant locations were also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, incidents of recombination between various lineages were shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, incidences of recombination have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs have been recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautious that artificial selection can play a role in unintentional changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the selection pressure experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 integrity can be observed in turtle and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca showed a single nucleotide insert resulting in skeletal shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV was also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir host.
Light or symptomless symptoms were detected when cockroaches were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoV and cockroaches.
It appears that cockroaches adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in cockroaches will effectively decrease the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in frogs was suppressed due to increased regulation of the natural killer cell receptor inhibitors NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression of the primary class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of cockroaches can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonuclease thus putting selective pressure on the production of highly pathogenic virus strains when entering a new hostel.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of proteins or new protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is non-pathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir accommodation, such as dwarfs and camels.
CoV replicates vigorously without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of the presence of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response as well as cytokine storms, with pulmonary damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
On the contrary, in carriers without symptoms, the immune response is already independent of CoV replication.
The same strategy to determine the correlation of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are strong in cockroaches.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflamasoma in cockroaches is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflamasoma with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common course of occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While dwarf beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also dwarf CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mosses and other animals on the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV grinding has been found to be highly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that grinding may act as one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV grinding may contribute a gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV is back in the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
CoV studies in butterflies and other animals have drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCoV on human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from cockroaches and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and mosquitoes in the wet market, it is possible that the closure of the wet market and the killing of all mosquitoes in it effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, grinding should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several grinding beta-CoV lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted to humans through mowing and other mammals still needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arab camels.
It serves as an important means of transportation as well as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for local communities.
The Arabs are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all the camels to control MERS, as is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we successfully eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, potentially zoonotic dwarf CoVs are very diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and undergo recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and management plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spread.
Although butterflies have many features that support the spread of the virus, human chances of contact with butterflies and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are dedicated to stay away from wildlife.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural host, which will prove beneficial in preventing future animal-to-human transmission and outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep humans at a distance from the ecological reservoir of natural zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been discovered.
First, if cockroaches transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to cockroaches, conditions when cockroaches and cockroaches share ecological cockroaches are important to know.
Second, if butterflies have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact with butterflies should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as the actual intermediate host, the way that the mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, frogs, and frogs, should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be done.
Whether butterflies, frogs, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuing research in this field will unravel the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates to the diagnostic criteria of “presumed cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 need to be made
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and becomes a good reference for fighting pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “presumed cases” and “confirmed cases” based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The book has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has released a total of seven editions with some contexts changed considerably.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires updates based on the Diagnostic and Handling Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirming the suspected case requires a combination of one of the epidemiological history pictures with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or requires the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed clusters of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as homes, offices, classrooms, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristic imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages of aging.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on cases with any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) an entire virus genome sequence shows high homogenity for a new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or a change in specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or a titer increase ≥4 times in the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR tests of nucleic acids in respiratory or blood samples were added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection in blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which improve the availability of various samples, and supports the inclusion of positive results of certain antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to alert patients with atypical and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flow charts need to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For diagnosis of “presumed cases” and “confirmed cases”, we recommend that you follow and abide by the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death rate in a single day from the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh the number of cases of infection recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
There were a total of 17 deaths.
In an online news release, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait’s Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will be stopped longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The shutdown on public transport has begun on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential necessities – medicine, fuel, and food – is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed 1 million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia experienced its first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was one of the few countries that remained free from coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS news agency, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections.
Across the world, countries are announcing stricter measures to stop the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the territorial quarantine until May 1.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russian citizens will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one rejection.
Saudi Arabia has extended the nighttime in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the whole day; previously, it was only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to apply nighttime between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended the residence order until May 1.
Australian stores lower the purchase limit of toilet clothes per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the Australian Woolworth and Coles store chain respectively lowered the purchase limit of toilet clothes to two and one packs per transaction in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also applied a one-pack limit, on Monday.
The restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on his Facebook page.
Buyers arely accumulating supplies due to fear of COVID-19 if the community has to conduct self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet clothes for home delivery to one pack per order.
The change follows a restriction of four packs per transaction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles that with the enforcement of the restrictions on the four packages, “many stores are still out within an hour of delivery,” and called the request “never happened before,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unexpected.”
Sales “raised sharply” last week, according to one of Woolworths’ spokesmen.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To avoid shortages, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local government agencies’ limitations on truck delivery times made it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers strive to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had discharged stocks early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled up supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet clothes are large-volume items so that the amount of supply is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the shortage of goods becomes more noticeable.
Coles and Woolworths argued [that] if there were a lot of items on the shelves, if products like toilet clothes and sanitation could be [bought] and there were in large quantities, panic could be minimized, said Russel Zimmerman through ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet fabrics Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Fabric, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, emphasize that they work 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet clothes to the first auction dealer in Melbourne, while fewer auctions are held as buyers take a break for the long holiday weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet fabrics.
Shops were actually reluctant to apply the restrictions, according to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, they said they didn’t plan to impose purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, hand-washing soaps, and flour.
Also outside of Australia, on Sunday afternoon the UK online supermarket Ocado observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet clothes to two packs containing 12 reels.
World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
Every country can still change the path of this pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO.
We are very alert either due to the level of spread and severity of the worrying or due to the level of slowness of the worrying action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic “has never happened before.”
He said, in a record published by CNN in February, “except for influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been tracked from its onset to its continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, “and we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows a decision by the WHO in January that declared the outbreak a downturn of social crime that troubled the world.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, “The outbreak is going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak, identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a global public health outbreak on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13,04% to 0,08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, shutting your mouth when you cough, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolating people who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, night hours, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has resulted in severe global socioeconomic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and widespread shortages of supply of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei province capital), a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to dwarf coronavirus, dwarf coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms later known fell ill on December 1, 2019, and the person did not have a clear association with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial clusters of cases in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unchecked report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case traceable to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, is likely to be the first.On February 26, 2020, the WHO that, with new cases declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, a relatively small number of cases among young people, with people aged 19 years and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Chief British Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were estimated to be undetected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that infections in Italy are expected to be higher than cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure is likely to be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are healed.
For those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing health disorders, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official calculation of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who died giving positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures probably do not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, at a care home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess mortality rates during the pandemic exceeded official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.
A female spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, “We know [the number of deaths] is lower than the actual figure,” a statement supported by non-scientific reports about too low calculations in the U.S. Too low calculations often appear in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy, respectively.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths to cases globally was 6,0% (97.039/1,617.204) as of 10 April 2020.
These numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated death rate to cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom onset 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-binding and follow a specific population ranging from infection to the resolution of cases.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the overall pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimated range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzed the impact of the assessment on the CFR estimate.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of these outbreaks are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, “Without any control, infectious outbreaks usually slide down and then begin to decline when the disease is out of available shelter.
However, it’s almost impossible to make a reasonable forecast at the moment about when it will happen.”
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak could end in June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on rare steps to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be needed “until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's little likely that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, could disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The virulence of the repetition will depend on the group immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and an infected person may be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegma), loss of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, thinning, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. The WHO stated that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed chest or sedentary chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bleeding on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who have close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and symptom disappearance) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, in uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lost their odor initially was 30%, then decreased to 15%.
The details of how the disease spreads are still being investigated.
COVID-19 spread is believed to occur mainly during close contact and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of someone nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the stool, this risk is believed to be low.
The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms begin, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms appear.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases have been laboratory-confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steels, one day on cartons, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains of dwarf derivatives.
The virus has a 96% similarity at the level of the entire genome with other dwarf coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain sections of the genome sequence between the mole virus and the human virus.
To date, comparisons of the entire genome found that there was mostly 92% similarity of genetic material between the melting coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that melting is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation in the end is done through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the infected secretion or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a plethora of imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
The WHO has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
The test used a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is carried out on nasopharyngeal evaporation, but throat evaporation can also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the US, the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of X-ray imaging and computed tomography (CT) in a symptomatic person include asymmetric peripheral ground glass gravity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenovirus, non-confirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in the epidemic area.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect viral imaging features with X-ray and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of this disease includeining good personal hygiene in a comprehensive way, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing clothes when coughing or sneezing as well as directly disposing of the tissue to the garbage.
People who may have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a stage of public scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread across the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers who deal with people who may be infected are advised to take standard preventive measures, contact prevention measures, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such restrictions on surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for use voluntarily, and by 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other phones.
Further, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19.There are misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, rinse the nose and cough with a spray is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after penetrating the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with bended elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and distance of the breathing droplets spread when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the timing and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch the face with not clean enough hands, which is the primary source of transmission.”
The WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those treating COVID-19, although the WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical facial masks made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of medical one-time masks to healthy communities, especially when nearby (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
The Thai health authorities recommend that people make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit people from going out in public places without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear facial masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering Toscana to wear a face mask.
Israel urges all its citizens to wear facial masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has required train and inter-city bus passengers to wear facial masks as of April 1.
Panama mandates the use of facial masks every time outside the home, as well as recommends the making of homemade facial masks for those who cannot buy facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is a measure of infection control intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centers.
People can apply methods of social restriction by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments impose or impose social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced, from 250 people (if COVID-19 spread is not known in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Lansions and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems who have a higher risk of serious illness and complications recommended the CDC to be as much as possible at home alone in areas affected by the outbreak at the community level. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social restriction" to "physical restriction", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact byining social relationships, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social restriction" gives the impression that people should completely isolate themselves socially and do not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes the urge to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have viruses or viral symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for those belonging to the high-risk group.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to countries or regions with widespread spread of COVID-19 are advised to carry out self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategy in control of outbreaks is prevention or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Controlling is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating infected people as well as taking other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of diseases, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and the community.
A combination of protective and mitigating actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base reproduction figure to less than 1.A part of managing the outbreak of infectious diseases is trying to lower the epidemic peak, known as lowering the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload on health services and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing facial masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as shutting down schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic actions aimed at curbing the outbreak are carried out in China as the severity of the outbreak becomes real, such as quarantining the entire city and imposing a strict travel ban.
Other countries also implement various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass filtering and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who carry out self-quarantine and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and punishes the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the peak of health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be chosen, but it should beined as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until vaccines are available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will bounce back rapidly as the suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress pandemics have social and economic impacts.
No specific antiviral medication has yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking free-selling flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the condition of the patient.
A number of compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some “traditional and home remedies” can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO’s European regional offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing if possible, canceling elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and enhancing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be traced to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the CDC of Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his boss for the warnings he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A large number of unknown cases of pneumonia were to the health authorities in Wuhan, which then launched the investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during New Year's Eve and because Wuhan is a major transportation and rail transit hub.
On January 20, China 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.

The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 outbreak of SARS when Chinese authorities were accused of closing-covering so hindering the prevention and prevention efforts and the current crisis with the central government “providing routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the New Year holiday.”
On 23 January, in response to the central government’s decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the move was “clearly not a WHO recommendation,” it was also “a very important indication of the commitment to curb the epidemic where the outbreak was most concentrated” and he called it “unprecedented in the history of public health.”On 30 January, after confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as the world’s worrisome public health outbreak (PHEIC), the sixth since the first measure was taken during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of the “risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that have not yet had a stable health system.
Responding to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily disrupt travel and international trade” and “the WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement.”

A number of provincial-level Chinese Communist Party (CPC) administrators have been fired in connection with dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Several Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous acknowledgments that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the U.S. or Italy.

We were told to try and convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push to influence the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is “a geo-political component, which includes the struggle to gain influence through the dismissal of facts and the ‘politics of generosity’.”
Borrell also said that, “China aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the US, they are a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called for the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, andly sent aid to the last two countries.

On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian troops to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or useless to Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out a “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm attack.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo aircraft containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “when offering help to counterparts in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get a chance, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
NATO military exercises “Defender 2020” scheduled in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, the exercise not only endangers the lives of U.S. troops and many of the participating European countries, but also the population of the countries in which they operate.”The Iranian government is heavily affected by this virus, with about two dozen parliamentarians infected and fifteen current or previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to the international market as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted a call to the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.

Coronavirus outbreaks are blamed for cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-caused purchases, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Some areas also suffered from purchases due to panic that resulted in empty basic needs, such as food, toilet clothes, and bottled water, which triggered a shortage of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to price increases up to twenty times the normal price and triggered delays in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also causes a shortage of self-protection equipment worldwide, and the WHO warns that this will endanger health.
In Australia, the pandemic offers new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were avoided from food deficiency.
Chinese and Italian measures in combating the illegal harvesting and trade of important products have been successful so that the expected acute food shortages in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its massive agricultural output, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the nutritional adequacy of the population.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The deterioration of the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the outbreak of the virus is thought to cause a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain turbulent until there is a clearer picture of the potential outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the impact of the economic downturn caused by the epidemic on global growth could go beyond the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
Experts at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimated the outbreak had an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has “cracks” after oil prices have dropped sharply due to a decrease in demand from China.

On February 27, due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices closed the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s government credit rating, butined a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many people think a recession could happen.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely central bank and state emergency measures.
The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry is at a level never seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Imlek New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people have been cancelled by the central and local governments, including the annual New Year’s Eve festival, and private companies have also independently shut down shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year celebrations and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong increased the control of infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March, and canceling New Year's celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers experienced a 50-60% decline.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping center operators are implementing additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the buyer’s temperature, and cancellation of events.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America’s estimates, pandemic-induced recessions could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to situations without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were displaced at home in the interior province or trapped in the Hubei province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the outbreak of the coronavirus could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Territorial quarantine in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since the imposition of the territorial quarantine in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany applied for a government-subsidized short-term employment scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
Across the world, the performance arts and cultural heritage sectors are heavily affected by pandemics, which affect the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector strive to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, safeguard the safety of employees and society, and support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions will be closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another adverse impact of this latest and extremely rapidly growing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which fell on the last week of the Christian Passover season, were cancelled.
Many dioceses advise Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services through radio, live online broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or landscape worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic diocese and the emptying of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and churches.
The Iranian Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the area affected by the outbreak and places of worship later closed, while Saudi Arabia has banned entry of foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “re-scheduled until after 2020, but not more than the summer of 2021.”Around the world, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites report a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many major theaters such as Broadway also postponed all performances.
Artists are exploring different ways to continue to produce and share works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live broadcast concerts online or creating web-based “festivals” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many Internet meme themed coronavirus spread online with a lot of people turning to humor and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
A February report (when the majority of cases are still limited to China) noted the racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim to be a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei report discrimination because of their local origin.
There is already support for Chinese people, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese citizens from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag has become a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States increased rates of racist harassment and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese Virus,” a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and study in major Indian cities havely experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
President of the Bharatiya Janata state unit party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God has avenged them."
The statement was later criticized by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misleading".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese populations sparked a pandemic, with foreigners depicted as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "crop."
Many newspapers that use paid confinement have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make outbreaks-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on pre-print servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and which detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or still active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
The antibody test shows the number of people who have already been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests that countries have carried out.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of cases of fatality, which is most likely calculated too high in some countries.
Using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on a respiratory sample obtained by a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal flares or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on the throat is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear in the throat as long as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep respiratory tract using an inhalation catheter or material removed through cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test instruments to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
South Korean company Kogenebiotech has developed a clinically-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene owned by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools.In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has distributed the New 2019 RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus Diagnostic Panel (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the older version of the test tool gave unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that were state and local laboratories allowed to carry out tests.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There are no quantity limits announced; samples collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the trial was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinicly developed a trial to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be carried out within 3.5 hours at high volumes so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (US) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott’s m2000 systems; the FDA had previously issued the same authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology other than PCR.
Because it does not require a series of cycles of temperature change, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the new coronavirus nucleocapside protein (N protein) are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of delivering results within 15 to 20 minutes like a quick influenza test.
A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that “thorax photos have small diagnostic values in the early stages, since CT findings [computed tomography] may already exist before the onset of symptoms.”
Characteristics of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass gravity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura domination, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtration or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early filtration.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms begin, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
Automated systems with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these inspections, but their availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, one sample of peripheral blood is generally used obtained through a skin spotting.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required before inspection.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 agencies that provide notification to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
By 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test instrument that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its test capacity is up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the infection began.In early April, the UK found that not one antibody test device it purchased was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has drawn up a scheme so that patients are expected to stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. NHS UK announced that the NHS is pioneering a scheme to test suspicious cases at home so as to eliminate the risk of the patient infecting others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect the ambulance if used. In the screening test for suspicious cases of COVID-19, a health professional will take the sample using appropriate preventive measures.
On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in road care order and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, landscape tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany is unknown as only positive results are.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples have been tested until and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6,9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if the combined sample was found positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000 square meter emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in Indonesian) opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling suggests that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and related costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity was not available.
The Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. This balanced design can be carried out in a small lab without the need for robotic fluid handling.
By March, deficiencies and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers sought to explore a sample preparation protocol involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing.On March 31, the United Arab Emiratesly performed more coronavirus testing per capita population than any country, and was ready to increase the scale of testing to reach most populations.
This is achieved through a combination of landscape testing and the purchase of population-scale mass laboratory results from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various test prescriptions targeting different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test devices that were shipped to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
German prescriptions were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28, thus slowing down testing available in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
Instead, experts say the extensive availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private-sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for enhanced testing programmes as the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing waiting for work in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of steam tools and chemical reagents became crippling.
In March 2020, China accuracy issues on their test tools.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC had "faults"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by the private. Spain bought the test tools from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the test tools correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw equipment that produced false results, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test device be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test device that Turkey bought from China had a "high error level" and they did not "use it".The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test devices from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test device could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of positive tested people and tracking people in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first site of deaths from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, with an interval of about 10 days.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were found in quarantine.
With travel restrictions to these communities, the new infection took place altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is developing much slower than other developed countries though without extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also dealt with the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with non-aggressive regional quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower cases mortality rates, probably because these countries were more able to detect people who had mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have test capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive test results" column is affected by the country's test policies.
Countries that only test people treated in hospitals will have a higher % positive score than countries that test all of their population, whether they show symptoms or not, with other similar factors.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person’s hands that aims to remove dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or sores, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning your child’s ass or changing the diaper, before breastfeeding, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce child mortality at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased hands-washing practices could slightly boost high growth of infants.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea to about a quarter; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the leading ISPA, is the number one cause of child death; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet becomes an embedded habit that can save more lives than vaccines or any medical measures, as well as reduce diarrhea-related deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory tract infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects yourself from impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is frequent hand washing that can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which are common among health workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases fecally-orally, namely: before and after using the toilet (urine, urination), after cleaning the child's ass (change the diaper), before breastfeeding, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other important times to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent disease transmission are before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal dirt or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practised handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Now there are several methodologies of behavioral change available to improve the adoption of handwashing habits with soap at critical times.
The Basic Health Care program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scale action to support children’s health and education.
Giving worm medication twice a year, coupled with washing hands daily with soap and brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic dirt, are not easily soluble in water.
Even so, the cleansing of fats and proteins is assisted by a sufficient flow of water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies examining the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was unlikely to occur because the bacteria were flushed with foam.
Nevertheless, the CDC continues to state that “liquid soaps whose removal from the container without touching hands are preferred.”
Antibacterial soaps are widely encouraged to health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant organism strains.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, advanced formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial agent, and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon’s Faculty of Public Health shows that regular soaps are as effective as consumer-level antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hands.
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to the belief of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents such as non-water-based alcohol rubbers (also referred to as alcohol-based hand rubbers, antiseptic hand rubbers, or hand rinsing) began to become known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on alcohol isopropyl or ethanol that are formulated together with thickening substances such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or together with humectan such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of fermented hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand dehydration containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an effective germ killer.
Alcohol sanitation kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol sanitation containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol rubbers in adequate amounts should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of both hands and on the sides and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries out.
Fingers should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing them on both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands rather than rubbing your hands, especially when your hands look dirty.
Increased use of sanitary agents due to ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, sanitary agents should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing, unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin, unless emulsifiers and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emoliences to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitation containing emoliences caused much lower irritation and drying of the skin than soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubbers are rare.
Lower tendencies cause contact dermatitis that disrupts the attractiveness of this product compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean hands of organic matter, but only disinfect it.
For this reason, hand cleaners are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still in the hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitization depends heavily on the ingredient and its formulation, and according to history, this product performs significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol rubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as alternatives to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for disease prevention include the following measures:
Wet your hands with running hot or cold water.
Water flowing is recommended because the inhabited bascom may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to have no impact.
Rub your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, on the sides of your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Shake for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Stir thoroughly under the flowing water.
Washing inside the basque can make your hand contaminated again.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more likely to re-contaminate.The areas that are often missed are the thumbs, wrists, the area between fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scaled nail paint can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep your hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A range of low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from slurries or bottles hanging and wrapped and/or using ashes, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-efficient solutions, such as “tippy-tap”, as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy crane is a simple technology that uses a water bottle hanging with a rope, a hose operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels of paper leaves, hot air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in fingerbooks and 254% in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an average increase in the total number of bacteria 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with sheets of paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palms.The researchers also performed tests to determine the potential for cross contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which inhales air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow out microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper sheets showed no significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After drying hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many manufactures of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with the use of paper sheets.
Washing hands with hand sanitizing fabric is an alternative while traveling if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rates of infection decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is carried out for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in large quantities or a gel to soak and rub each part of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed with each other with the fingers linked.
If there is dirt under the nail, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since the germs can survive in the water present in the hands, the hands need to be thoroughly rinse and dry with a clean cloth.
After drying, paper sheets are used to turn off the tap water (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids the re-contamination of the hands from the surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the order of health care is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuously forgetting to wash their hands before touching a patient thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standards for handwashing and handwashing in the healthcare sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
Relevant reviews were conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Seconds” to Wash Hands:
Exposure to blood/body fluids
before aseptic tasks, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") works to kill handwashing materials.
Such killing functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'wash' hands before surgery, a crane that can be turned on and turned off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, sterile wipes for drying hands after washing, and a sterile brush for rubbing as well as other sterile instruments for cleaning under the nails are required.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and lower arms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinse, water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After washing hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand sanitization before and after dealing with a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit obtained is very little when the frequency of hand cleaning is increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based handwashing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashers to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care orders can involve education for staff on handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based handwashers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to figure out the most effective interventions in a variety of health care orders.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognised as a basic, cost-effective way to good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in residential homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal hand washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, hand washing cranes near private or public toilets are rare, although options are available to make a cheap hand washing place.
Anyway, a low rate of hand washing can also occur due to an established habit and not due to a lack of soap or water.
The urge and urge to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
Once the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a handwashing facility can be part of a handwashing promotion campaign to reduce child illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign that seeks to the goal of changing behavior. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies looked at the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the amount of years lost due to illness.
One review showed that promoting handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable conditions, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a rotten smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect yourself from the infectious disease.
For example, a poster "the right hand washing technique" was hung next to the hand washing toilet in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" something means expressing someone's reluctance to take responsibility for something or engage in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In the work of Shakespeare, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to constantly wash her hands to clear the imagined stain; an act that showed her guilt for the evil she had committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been found that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were left to wash their hands after such a washing had a smaller margin of engaging in "cleaning" compensatory actions, such as being a volunteer.
Religion orders handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of the ritual of handwashing in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jewish, Lavabo in Christian, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders handwashing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions mandate washing hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish, and Islam obligate to wash hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Occupational hazard control for COVID-19 is the implementation of occupational safety and health methodology for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control at work depends on the workplace and work tasks, which are based on an assessment of the risk of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of each worker who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other colleagues; for these jobs, basic infectious prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of exposure includes work that requires close or frequent contact with unknown or suspected people suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in ongoing communities or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to the basic measures of prevention of infection, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protection equipment when encountering COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers and body chambers exposed to people who are known or suspected of suffering from COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or take or handle samples from, people who are known or suspected of suffering from COVID-19.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include technical controls, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protection tools that are suitable for work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several impacts on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to obtain these goods (such as shopping outside of busy hours, through shipping, or on-site).
Finally, the shipment of goods from the geographical areas that are heavily affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. Precautionary preparations and plans for the control of infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans take into account the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as individual workers’ risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the necessary controls to address such risks and an emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and control plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Epidemic control objectives include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications,ining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the countermeasures taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative distribution, and lastly self-protection tools.
Technical controls include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policies or procedures that require action by workers or employers.
Self-protection tools (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent partial exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g. respirator), worn consistently and correctly, inspected, treated and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic infectious prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory ethics include covering coughing and sneezing, providing fabrics and garbage containers, preparing work remotely or to work with gradual arrival/return times, if necessary, informing workers not to use other people’s tools and equipment, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation from potentially transmitting individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using febrile reducers or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that sick leave policies be flexible to allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact within a distance of six feet (1,8 meters) with people who are unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in communities around the business location, or because someone is new to travel internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This group of nuts includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high-volume retail orders. Technical control for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic screw protective lenses, and installing drive-thru or landscape windows for customer service. Administrative control for this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work turns with arrival/return times, gradually setting up non-essential travel to the site that is experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak, developing an emergency communication plan for the forum to respond to worker concerns, equipping workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, training workers who may need to use face-to-face protective tools about how workers are hanging on their workplace, providing hands-on or resource, supporting the public and changing environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, designating one cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin driver must wear medical gloves when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other self-protection equipment if sick passengers have a fever, constant cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other unused items should be disposed of in life hazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial cruises, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating themselves, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person experiences fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is carried out in the cabin of the isolated person. Regardless of spread in the community, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is transmission in the community at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, vocal class, or dining in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local communities, in addition to social restriction strategies, extending school closures can be considered.For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who have to make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection equipment.
If close contact occurs during the capture, the worker must clean and disinfect the belt and work equipment before reuse using a spray or household cleaning cloth and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of worn APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain bodies and healthcare personnel to be in the high or very high risk exposure category.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport personnel exposed to patients who are known or suspected of COVID-19.
This work becomes a high risk exposure if the employee performs aerosol-generating procedures on, or takes or handles samples from, a patient known or suspected of COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure body room work includes workers involved in preparing bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high exposure risk if workers perform autopsy. Additional technical control for this risk group includes insulation space for patients known or suspected of COVID-19, including when aerosol production procedures are carried out.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some health care orders and corpse rooms.
The specimens must be treated with preventive measures of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who arrive be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected of cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work within 6 feet of patients known or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who undergo aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, a NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter face cover respirator should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend that clothes be completely closed or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at the entry point.
For people taking respiratory samples, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical limitations such as a blind window, with only people involved in direct care allowed to enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD needed for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human connections and responsibilities we have with each other.
We’ve never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, collaboration, and building the global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we have witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and chats is an extraordinary validation of the existence of extraordinary human beings, which we are lucky enough, to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to be able to call you my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for today’s world to be able to access Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays running, help pay our colleagues, or help keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, especially nowadays.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the organization’s survival during this time.
We are keen to relieve the pressure and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the schedule of work, it’s okay.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We do not set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, shop for basic necessities, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
This shouldn’t have to be said, but we say it.
A sick leave or PTO is not required, just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure that key fields of work can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed suffering from COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management.)
The employees whose salary is based on hours will be paid in full.
We’ve said it, and say it again, to honor our commitment to our counterparts and time-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their usual working hours when the situation is normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Work is considered essential.
There are some work to continue.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There’s a lot to do for all of us, we’re just going to focus entirely on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now is not going to be okay for the future.
We don’t plan on “working overtime chasing out” after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the current unrealistic deadlines.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will endeavour to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the App (Annual Plan)?
To adapt to the new reality and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressure across the organization.
We will forward our proposal to the Board next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, Exposure, and Office Cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to great concerns, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own security assurance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We were pleased that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-distance work order, in line with the shared guidance with San Francisco.
As known by some of our NYC-based colleagues, we are also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote collaborators realize that it may need adjustments and they would like to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting for a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Defining meetings clearly, making an agenda, and sending up previous reading materials.
Make videos default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help create a meeting record (or do collaborative recording).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small meals.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The SDM Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the improvement of work distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic ended.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one will be reimbursed for having to delay or modify those targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
Overall, the sentiment of the entire global community appears to be saddened by this disturbance, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, either Wikimedia or others.
In the future, CRT is working to set up pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situations
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a dedicated staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 in the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major workflows, or coverage difficulties, or anything else that may require help, don’t hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be connectors as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations for International SDM.
None of these changes are seen as neglecting our work and obligations.
Rather, this change is a recognition that, at the moment, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in these situations so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our movement, and give the world the service they trust.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create room for important work coming in a few weeks and maybe months to come.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and the renal amino acid collectrin terminal-C transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single membrane protein of type I, with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes mainly of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and plain arterial muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
Finally, ACE2 cut off the carboxyl terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the membrane carrier of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on the spike or spike of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located inside the cell.
This virus entry process also requires the priming of S protein by the serine protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that “the use of ACE inhibitors resulted in a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
Furthermore, “the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients suffering from stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less strong compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipoplysaccharides.
RhACE2 half-life in humans is approximately 10 hours with an interval of 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracking to counter the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, a process of identifying people (“contact”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which gain official government support in several regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking apps have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of the app user.
Alternatives that are not too intrusive to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality to support the Bluetooth-based apps directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, the app is called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide quick response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app is still waiting for approval in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking app is in an advanced development phase and will be available for deployment in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow; the app is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited a number of practical problems that could occur on application-based systems, which included false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken by the application was limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting only to “official” or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular as to whether surveillance infrastructure built to deal with a coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limitations on such surveillance.
The organization sets out eight conditions for the government project:
Surveillance must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extension of surveillance and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
The use of the data must be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and proved to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization.
any sharing of data with third parties must be defined by law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation meant all "relevant stakeholders" required, which included public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address continuous surveillance issues by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system when it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-app-based systems are used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted with extensive changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a centralized system and a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Nearby Tracking Protecting Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as Contact Event Number, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or flow intersection data to track COVID-19 spread.
It is based on research from the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technologies and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a widely overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect of achieving widespread acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the systems.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
the launch of a tool to allow the government to create an official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to address the problem of continuous data capture and surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way after the threat passes.
Drug substitution (also referred to as giving a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task to a drug or a transition to therapy) is the use of a drug that has been approved for a new therapeutic purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition different from the original purpose of drug development.
This pathway is a scientific research pathway that is currently underway to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein has several ligan binding sites.
Analysis of these ligan binding sites could be the basis for a project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heliase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.

The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against several filo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people in hospital and with severe COVID-19 disease, namely two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one non-controlled (Italy).

Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to the WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in a Phase I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A massive outbreak has spread around the world by 2020, resulting in huge investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative issued a statement in April that things to pay attention to in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advanced to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Developer of Phase I and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II trials conducted early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, placebo-controlled, and in several locations, while determining the more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates being developed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" studies).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.

Earlier that week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered “a ‘huge sum of money’ for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would get preclinical test results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates in the final stage could start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wien, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, with a total CEPI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplification RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical control research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly at the same time, the Canadian government announced funding of C$192 million dedicated to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national “vaccine bank” containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine a test of PittCoVacc, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in mice; they stated that "the MNA that gave the S1 subunit vaccine SARS-CoV-2 triggered a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to be visible 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterological effect, also called a non-specific effect.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they spread.
A further tracking trial in Australia attempted to follow 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, showed the need for preventive measures to level 3 biological safety in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, no medication or protective vaccine for SARS has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus-vektor vaccines, two adenovirus-vektor (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vektor-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts counter the conspiracy theory that claims the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus spreads mainly between people when in close contact, often through a spark or small droplets generated by coughing, sneezing, or while speaking.
Although it is produced when breathing out, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not infectious to distant distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the subsequent stage of the disease.The standard diagnostic method is with a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyngeal cavity.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and the person who treats them.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend its use, and others require its use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People who are infected with the virus may be without symptoms or experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or numbness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, and a pale face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Symptoms of upper respiration, such as sneezing, numbness, or sore throat can be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially only had a clinical picture of chest ejaculation and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97,5% of infected people will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began including symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large-scale viral load.
Speaking loudly releases more sparks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can cause the droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the hallways outside people’s rooms produce positive samples for virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the stool, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99 percent copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the protective fatty layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, and free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in a median of two days after hospital treatment began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of the trial.
Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are present in the coronavirus that is related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a “spike” (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people treated in hospitals in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illnesses.
The level of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism to respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells secreting pathogenic GM-CSF were shown to correlate with recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathologies in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been on autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually done on respiratory samples obtained through nasopharyngeal evaporation; however, nasal evaporation or sputum samples can also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken at a two-week interval so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected before) are under development, but are not widely used.
China’s experience with the tests showed that the accuracy was only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan University Hospital in Wuhan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation can appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of severe viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multiple stem giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: the arrangement of exudates in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Diseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and leukoerythroblastic reactions
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inner part of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
The restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since vaccines are expected to not be available until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the “lifting curve.”
The CDC also recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after piercing the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.In areas where commercial hand sanitation is not available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance "is not an active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glycerin is added as humectan.
People are dealt with with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygiene and lifestyle as well as a healthy diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for dealing with COVID-19 patients who are being treated in hospital.
Intensive care practitioners and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, namely the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) more than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the order of health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Air-to-Air Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures, and air-to-air preventive measures.
Recommended equipment is: APD robe, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face mask) is better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Respirator N95 is designed to protect against inherent air particles such as dust, but efficacy against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protector or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too severe to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are severe.
Type of respiratory support for people suffering from COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively researched for persons treated in hospitals, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to continue to use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flowing nasal canula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to deal with a sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients who are treated in hospital end up in ICUs.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
A ventilator capable of performing high pressure control and PEEP mode is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax related to the ventilator.
High PEEP may not be available on old fans.
Research on the potential treatment begins in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time until 2021, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommended volunteers participated in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorization for plasma convalescence as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect close contacts using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials. Big data analytics on mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cellular data of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told by mobile operators that “40% of citizens are still moving.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rise in social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic degradation are the perfect storms that jeopardize the mental health and well-being of communities."
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, which resemble other general upper respiratory tract diseases, such as colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting abnormalities, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients treated in hospital, while abnormalities in kidney function were observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between symptom awakening and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitals.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study that looked at early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased levels of troponins or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people treated in hostels have congenital conditions.The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of mild case counting can cause the death rate to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that deaths were the result of incidents that occurred in the past may mean that current mortality rates are calculated too low.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-lasting immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered possible if other coronavirus behavior is seen, but COVID-19 recovery cases have been followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a residual worsening infection, not a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and originated from animals, through a spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely driven by transmission from human to human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom departure date was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO established the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infections.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths to cases globally was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include the case fatality number (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality number (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-binding and follow a specific population ranging from infection to the resolution of cases.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread to young people, leading to a relatively lower mortality rate, and it is unlikely that all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0,004% of the population) were confirmed to die from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and their mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between new men and women not apparent at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reasons for these gender-based differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reasons.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who die from COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, flu, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers is higher, especially nurses, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is an abbreviation for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in accordance with international recommendations for designations aimed at preventing stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 was named Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the “COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease was commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease as temporary names for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that advocate not to use location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print healthcare materials such as nasal vapors and fan components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is in extreme need of a fan valve, and a supplier cannot provide in the required time scale, a local company redesigned and printed 100 valves needed in a night.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is underway by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to study the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, the researchers aim to make an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines created with these strategies should be tested for their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that caused the disease. Increased dependence on antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials ongoing by April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies against hydroxychlorococcine or chlorococcine.
The new targeted antiviral drug forms most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs is already available.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorocoin and hydroxyclorocoin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
By March 2020, there is temporary evidence for the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China, and Italy. Chlorocoin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a parallel review of this research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorocoin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that doubling doses is highly dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychlorococcine and chlorococcine under the policy of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanides have been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.Research suggests that early priming of the exposure protein by transmembraned serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chlorococcine and hydroxychlorococcine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Complications of cytokine storm can occur in severe advanced stage COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquin may have anti-cytocin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 trials at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to combat cytokine storms, which are suspected to be a cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-refractant cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no random and controlled evidence suggesting that tocilizumab is a robust treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and compressed antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinative method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with unsuccessful results.
Viral neutralization is the working mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that relies on antibodies and/or fagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of therapy with passive antibodies, for example, using produced monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Convalescent serum production, which is a liquid portion of the patient’s blood that has recovered and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
