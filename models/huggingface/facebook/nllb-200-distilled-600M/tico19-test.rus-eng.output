Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, confirming that despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase their readiness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as Type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), is the cause of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to current data, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% develop into a critical condition when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
This study analyses the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them to trends in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and now the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the rest of the world in the same way as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020  all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infection cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded from 31 December 2019 to that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, are in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. the number of COVID-19 cases in each country in the world, from official sources such as the health ministries of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyse the trends of COVID-19 spread in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated taking into account the normal COVID-19 outbreak in each EU/EEA country and in the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trend of the development of the sequenced cumulative COVID-19 disease over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the UK as a whole was in line with the trend observed in China's Hubei province (Fig. 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole started to rise around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative increase in COVID-19 cases were also observed in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognition of cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including overlapping testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 percent of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already crowded.
Currently, data on COVID-19 patients entering hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA is available only for 6 percent and 1 percent of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, such data should be collected systematically to supplement current observations on the number of reported cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011 in Europe, there has been a significant increase in the number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units: from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the outcomes of the COVID-19 risk assessment presents scenarios for modeling the resource load of healthcare systems with estimated hospitalization data for COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by certain EU/EEA and UK regions and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided as far as possible by the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2) level 2 units.
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-term outbreak scenario of SARS-CoV-2, and for the growing number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC Risk Express Assessment Results Report, an expeditious, preventive and comprehensive approach to curb the spread of SARS-COV-2 is of great importance, with the subsequent transition from containment to mitigation of consequences, as, given the projected rapid growth in disease outbreaks, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, adopt and adjust their response measures appropriately if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the express risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time to step up their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, the healthcare system in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by the type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We're going to look at the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in 2020 which falls on January 25 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who have been urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease  coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly across the country, and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of society and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report dated January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus identified from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
We will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronavirus-caused diseases  Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which started in 2012.
We will also discuss the current facts about prevention and disease prevention, as well as some other issues that are equally pressing.
Coronavirus has traditionally been a non-fatal pathogen that mainly causes about 15 percent of all respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have faced two highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrifying rate of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the cluster of unknown origin pneumonia cases first came to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known that medical workers were infected, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined, and the city's public transportation stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease found that 21 of the 41 confirmed coronavirus patients had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of this report , the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (fig. 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic development was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) following a multi-center clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients.
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but most were people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100 000), than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was spread clustered mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (29) days passed from the time of the symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
The average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 9.5 (4.813) days.
The base rate of reproduction (R0) was 3,77 (95 percent CI: 3,514,05), and the corrected R0 was 2,234,82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with the time of large-scale transportation on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnoses was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.101.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.024.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large shell viruses that contain a single strand of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronavirus are known to affect humans.
In cases of SARS and MERS-like coronavirus, the shell-shaped spider-like growths (S) glycoproteins bind to the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidaze-4 (DPP4) respectively, and then the membrane is synthesized.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genome of the RNA together with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98 percent consistent with 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak of the disease, at the Huainan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than it is to MERS-CoV.
With the help of an illuminating electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin incisions of the human respiratory epithelium.
It has been found that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease to a lesser degree than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and a secreted protein, encoded orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in terms of virus pathogenicity and suppress IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2,9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included both open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which is evidence for identifying and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target when conducting drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the hive and camels respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was established that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronavirus, namely bats' coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is unknown what species became the intermediate host that allowed the virus to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji and his colleagues suggested that snakes were the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which resulted in homologous recombination in the S-protein.
Chinese scientists in Guangzhou have suggested that pangolin  long-eared mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine  are potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 4050% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and to heat up to 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chlorophores and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the virus' activity, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Usually, the virus that enters the host's body first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (IRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help the cells to protect themselves.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell function, causing their programmed death.
Humor immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies extracted from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's hyperreaction results in the localization of large numbers of free radicals, which can cause serious lung and other organ damage, and in the worst case scenario, lead to polyorganism failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is a cluster infection, is more likely to affect older people with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The chances of infection are higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have a compromised immune system.
According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mainly 37 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average 3 days, with the spread ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus among those infected who have the disease without symptoms.
A 14-day quarantine is common practice for people who have had contact with the virus or who are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The primary and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only symptom or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, cramping, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no pathologies in the chest images.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98 percent high fever, 76 percent dry cough, 55 percent shortness of breath and 3 percent diarrhea; 8 percent of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of family infections and transmission of the virus from symptomless infected individuals.
Similar results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98 percent), dry cough (47 percent) and shortness of breath (55 percent).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throats (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99100 %), dry cough (2975 %), shortness of breath (4042 %), diarrhea (2025 %) and sore throat (1325 %), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 1420 % of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this figure, SARS deaths by November 2002 were 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to earlier research, the base reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.717.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in symptom manifestation, mortality rate and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, curbing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much harder than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster disease often occurs when a family or group of people are infected by a virus that has gathered together for some reason or has been found on a transportation such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or sick people during the last two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who are cured after being discharged from the hospital can be carriers of the virus again, and this is an alarm signal for prolonging the quarantine.
Early in the disease, patients have a normal or decreased number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphocytes with a level of < 4×109/L, including a level of < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine-aminotransferase and viralemia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes settled in the blood.
Patients with severe disease had elevated levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly decreasing.
Most COVID-19 patients have had chest x-ray pathologies characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or dimming of the matte glass type in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
When OCD develops, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis lead to significant gas exchange disruptions.
Type I and II pneumocytes dysfunction lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
So the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the placement of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes and intertissue lymphocyte infiltration, and the multi-nuclear syncytic cells in lung patients who died from the disease corresponded to the pathologies of viral infection and OCD and were similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 was the method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RTC with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-negative results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020, diagnoses have been made in China based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
A similar situation was the case with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, it is critical and necessary to combine data from disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and x-rays for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, a team of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR repeat-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at densities from 20 × 1018 mole/l to 200 × 1018 mole/l (10100 copies per microliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new technique, if it is successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of testing.
Because of the lack of experience in countering previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma be used to treat recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs, and may also affect other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, to a lesser extent.
However, impaired function and respiratory failure are the leading threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, for alleviating symptoms and saving lives, respiratory function support, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, noninvasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, is critical, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protecting vital organ functions are of paramount importance to patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals, which become the primary cause of OCD and polyorganic malfunction.
When treating a cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions, suppressing immunity is of utmost importance.
For the treatment of the cytokine storm, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used.
Other methods of treating cytokine storm based on suppressing immunity include modulating the immune response to control T-cells; blocking the production of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF cytokines; suppressing the janus kinase; using blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone-deacetalase inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunity suppressants to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of low- and medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with critical COVID-19.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of a remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Remdesivir later also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug composition to China for pairwise testing on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are awaited.
In addition, baricithinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as possible therapeutic options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicines with other medicines prescribed to patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies
Blood sampling from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, to offer mass use of this method before specific therapy is performed, it requires a test and explanations not yet made.
In addition, some disadvantages of plasma use should be carefully studied in view of the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is a potential threat to life.
Antibody levels in the blood are usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It's not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
So it's more important and practical to identify the B cells of recovered patients and identify the genetic code of the active antibodies or to do screening to find the active antibodies against critical virus proteins.
So we can move immediately to mass production of antibodies.
For millennia, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on a combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as identifying and testing these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of COVID-19 recovered patients was in a number of Chinese provinces where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87 percent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recoveries (13 percent).
However, this comparison is rather rough, as the assessment must take into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and colleagues published research materials comparing treatments exclusively based on Western medicine and combined treatment based on Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, eliminating symptoms, and providing hospital care was significantly shorter for patients who used a combination of Western and Traditional Chinese medicine than for patients who were treated only by Western methods.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who began to experience worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4 percent compared to 46.2 percent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 percent compared to 39 percent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more rigorously controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the techniques of traditional Chinese medicine or their combinations.
Patients who suspect or confirm COVID-19 are mostly afraid of acute and even life-threatening illnesses, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritability.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as corticosteroid insomnia, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early in the outbreak of the SARS virus, there were reports of a number of psychiatric conditions, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Compulsory contact monitoring and quarantine, which are part of measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase people's anxiety and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
Psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected and contacted persons, and to all other persons who require it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multi-profile psychiatric care brigades, regular and accurate updating of information on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the chain of transmission from infection-carrying animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to create vaccines based on S-protein, which aim to develop long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses were developed.
However, before clinical trials can begin, the efficacy of these potential vaccines under natural conditions in elderly patients, the model of lethal dose infection and the degree of protection against zoonotic virus infection must be determined.
Perhaps it's because the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and there hasn't been a single new case since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS disease continue to appear, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties, due to the long term (average 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic evolution of the coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to reveal the full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a disease predictive model to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on clinical trial data presented at the moment, the following factors may influence the prognosis of disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by SARS, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying disease and complications, and they were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (average age 66 versus age 51), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangyocytes, which may cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and disease are closely related and can distort outcomes.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is suggested to be considered as a potential prognostic factor for disease progression, therapy response, and final recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, severity of the disease and COVID-19 prognosis.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released when tissue is damaged.
So they're traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: For predicting outcomes and complications in COVID-19 treatment, along with other factors, consideration should be given to chest x-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids  are immunity suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which led to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpectedly severe stress, often because they have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high levels of uncertainty, and watch their relatives and other patients die.
To relieve stress and help them return to normal life, they need to be counselled and supported for a long time.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be distinct from the SARS epidemic in its features.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronavirus that cause common cold diseases, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or who have not yet completed their incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making it significantly more difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was believed that transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill, although in most cases, infection did not occur at an early stage.
So the COVID-19 epidemic today is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently undergoing a major work to declare a global quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extending the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population, introduced to break the spread chain of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are causing enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of newly identified patients is declining, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates are that the outbreak will end in March, and the phase of extinguishment will last 34 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a nasal and throat swab taken from patients recovering and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an effect.
Initial estimates put the Ebola virus at a cost of up to a million people and causing the deaths of half a million patients.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like SARS-CoV, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 could weaken and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic human-combined virus.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by high transmission rates through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in the sludge, which means that it's also possible to transmit it through the oral fecal route.
According to one recent study, 41 percent of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 nurses.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers who come into contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection  is wearing face masks; and surgical masks, and N95 class respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent microcapsules of fluid from potentially infected people from flying in the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virins from 10 to 80 nm, they only pass 5% of virins; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 class masks (series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear a protective jacket that is supported by the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type goggles.
All people in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more often with disinfectant washing agents, avoid leaving their homes, maintain self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of about a meter is considered an acceptable distance to the patient.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public, saying that the new virus has low contagion and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that preventing and controlling the disease would not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially as the whole country prepared for Chinese New Year celebrations and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive action to contain a potential epidemic at its early stages rather than reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly check and improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus of the second type, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of this writing, has spread to 50 countries.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of epidemic control and patient treatment.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the prevalence of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
Death rates from SARS are higher than in COVID-19 (10.91 percent compared to 1.44 percent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually only infect others in severe cases of the disease, so it is harder to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal RNA samples for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some key issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the fact that 96 percent of the homologous data between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus in bats has been found, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated in bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from its original owner, such as a bat, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely disrupt the transmission pathway, and the epidemic situation can escalate at any moment.
Molecular-level modeling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus get into the respiratory tract cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does a virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are essential, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever it takes, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The Zoonotic Origin of Human Coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus (CoV) and its carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoV) strains were known to cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China in late 2019 has again attracted attention to coronavirus and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV related virus.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonotic disease, and understanding its zoonotic origins will be very helpful.
Most human coronavirus are caused by bats, which are not pathogenic to them.
Intermediate carriers of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying carriers directly affects the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of animals that carry the coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we cite the data available on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, their zoological origin and the ways in which they are transmitted across species.
It's important to note that we're comparing and comparing different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current outbreak of the coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful carrier change and the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease are noted.
The coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, which have the largest RNA-containing genome, with a nucleotide capacity of 26,000 to 32,000, are named for their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a crown.
From a structural standpoint, coronavirus contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike-like protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also encode a number of linear-specific accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus), while the type of beta-coronavirus includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronavirus is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has been continuously overcoming interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens for humans.
There are seven human coronavirus cases known to date.
These include human alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronavirus types include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild-type symptoms such as colds and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively large number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and exhibiting non-cancerous symptoms.
The first human coronavirus strain, HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of nasal decay patients who contracted colds in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has gained more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a commonly held view that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected, and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019 and later renamed SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected has exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus are zoonotic, with bats, mice, or pets as their source.
Numerous datasets support the evolutionary nature of all human coronavirus from bats, which have well adapted viruses and have no pathogenic properties but show broad genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented a severe challenge to China and the world in terms of medical, scientific, social and moral concerns.
Studying the zoonotic mechanism of human coronavirus' origin will help us understand their natural history, the driving forces behind their evolution, and the factors that limit interspecies transmission.
It may also suggest or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial to preventing the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review contains general information about the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus originated are usually not pathogenic to their tank carriers, but they become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We're also analyzing the evolution of human coronavirus, which suggests that increased transmission is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the outcome of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample of a nasal sample of patients with a cold, various coronavirus were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronavirus have been identified in the last decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; the virus was later adapted to breeding in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and cough reported in 1020% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from the organ culture and subsequently serialized in the brains of the mouse-snout.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, with symptoms unlike those of other respiratory pathways, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread worldwide and are usually transmitted in the winter in moderate latitudes.
The incubation period of these two viruses is usually less than a week, followed by a disease of about two weeks.
According to the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a common cold of mild form.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems had severe lower respiratory tract infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the epidemic of atypical pneumonia, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by human coronavirus, and the cause of the disease was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of the disease and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Without taking into account the overactive spreaders, it was estimated that each patient could infect about two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was at the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle aches, headaches, high fever, general illness and wrinkles, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath.
Common deviations from the norm in SARS are lymphophenia, liver failure and elevated creatine kinase levels.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased levels of macrophages.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first detected from an open biopsy of a patient's lung relative who had arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronavirus.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands.
It was first found to affect mostly young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by symptoms such as nausea, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the same virus being isolated from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands who suffered from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually widespread.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with peak illnesses occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with worsening asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory illness, has been identified worldwide.
All four human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation causing highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in a rare case with the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has reportedly caused a serious lower respiratory infection in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to transmit and retain themselves effectively in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have taken place in the Middle East, but there have been cases of importation and spread through episodic secondary contagion cases in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  for both infections, progressive acute pneumonia is characteristic.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other human-borne coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there have been more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of high-mortality Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (34.4%), making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the period from mid- to late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, clusters of pneumonia patients were identified, which now, looking back, are linked to an infection caused by the type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been named coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei province is 4.2%, and outside it  1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by elevated temperature, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of the nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reported cases of symptomless SARS-CoV-2 infection, which indicates the virus's ability to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronavirus reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-to-human coronavirus have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 is showing the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in human coronavirus infections that cause out-of-hospital infections, including nonspecific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower here.
Third, there are also interesting patterns in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that are characteristic of both human and SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus, which causes out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. each subsequent infection of each person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.
The question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronavirus, causes out-of-hospital infections, is of particular interest.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the specificities of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission.
All four human coronavirus, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both of these could be considered the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronavirus, which causes severe disease in humans, and people who have human coronavirus causing severe disease, simply didn't survive.
To do this, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body to the extent that adaptive mutations accumulate that counter the carrier restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop transmission to humans through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For years, four out-of-hospital coronavirus have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
Highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and breed in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for a chance to hit sensitive human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has traits similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.
It's very easily transmitted, like out-of-hospital HCoVs, at least for now.
But it's more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoVs, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to humans and whether it will circulate in human environments without a tank or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier-reservoir is a continuous carrier of HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced to an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as a reinforcing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate in a lightning-like manner and then transmit it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can transmit a static infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural tank carrier.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that a zero-scale SARS patient had in his history contact with hunting-fishing animals (wildlife).
Further studies of grey prevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus among animal traders is higher than among the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and enot species dogs in live animal markets have become the first established carriers of viruses similar to and nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, no more cases of SARS were reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in most cases, the Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not on the market were not identified with SARS-CoV, which allows to conclude that the Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate enhancer carrier, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that numerous species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate enhancers.
They all seem to be static carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV has revealed a close-knit CoV of bats, which has been designated as the atypical pneumonia-related HKU3 sub-snouted bats coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese sub-snouted bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These and other bats' coronaviruses have 8892% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Flies have also been identified with several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV), but none of them, except for one, which is designated as WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, which was derived from a sample of bat feces, was shown to use ACE2 in bats, civets and humans as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis assigns MERS-CoV to the same group as both CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 in bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase MERS-CoV virus is phylogenetically closer to sequences from beta-coronavirus mice found in Europe and Africa.
Wild bats have not yet been found to have the live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 in bats is only 87%.
So bats might not be the direct container carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-horned camels are seropositive to the neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal mucous membranes of camels, further confirming camels' role as true tank carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms but a massive viral outbreak.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels released the virus not only through respiratory but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus in bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have no history of camel contact before symptoms occurred and are credible for human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% consistent with the RaTG13 CoV of bats, which is isolated from Asian sub-contractors Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parental relationships.
That is, bats may not be the direct carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found to have almost identical coronavirus in bats in the future.
It is believed that the direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been linked to many initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a likely case of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenome sequencing have concluded that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) that are at risk of extinction may also have transmitted the parent beta-coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes at 8592% is consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, with the nucleotide sequence-level identity being about 90%.
They are clustered into two subtle differentiations of viruses, similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RCD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with amino acid sequence identity at 97.4%.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains' RCDs are more divergent, despite the higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of patients with pangolin was also reported to have identified viral contingencies in samples from the lungs that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing methods to obtain a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It is possible that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus of pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 relatives, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RCD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 relatives, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the pangolin beta-coronavirus, a SARS-CoV-2 related strain, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolin, a SARS-CoV-2 sibling, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force behind evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronavirus.
There is still no definitive solution to the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from the coronavirus of bats, while the parent viruses of the strains HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in a North American three-colored mammal, shows close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was speculation that camels could be its intermediate carriers.
For clarity, modern knowledge about the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the ancestry.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted interspeciesally around 1890 and humans were infected from pets, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha-coronavirus mice have been found to be related to HCoV-229E.
Between them is the alpaca alpaca coronavirus.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with the Alps.
Second, the alphacoronavirus in bats, related to HCoV-229E, in bats is diverse and nonpathogenic, while the alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpaca coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
So the possibility that the alpacas got the alpha coronavirus, the HCoV-229E's relative, from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it's no surprise that bats could transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-coronavirus of bats could have served as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels could have become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and was later confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viruses for interspecies gene exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make bats the ideal distributors.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced to camel cattle decades ago.
It was well adapted to these camels, which went from being an intermediate carrier to a stable and natural tank carrier.
In these animals, MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and is characterized by relatively low mutation rates.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain a static carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the betacoronavirus of pangolin is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They can be static carriers of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies should confirm or rule out several possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus, a SARS-CoV-2 relative, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by extracting or splitting the feces of these animals.
Second, pangolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing carriers that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced into.
People get the virus through the separation of ducks and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic ones, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The testing of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, three major factors from the virus side also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of coronavirus can be considered to be mighty-high with an average replacement rate of approximately 104 replacements per year on one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronary viruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, which removal leads to an extremely high mutation rate and weakness or even inefficiency.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide counterpart suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Remdesivir  is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2, which needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutations in coronavirus is almost a million times higher than those in carriers.
In addition, mutation rates can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not adapted well enough to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
The virus is believed to have already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to camel-backed animals.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution favorable to the emergence of new coronavirus under the appropriate conditions.
This is due to the numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrix during RNA replication.
During transcription of the coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as the mixture vessel, the threads often switch.
Highly homologous full-size and subgenome RNAs can recombine and create new coronavirus.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronavirus such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction of the virus carrier with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
This article provides a typical example of positive selection in interspecies transmission, with recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adapting in different carriers, especially in relation to mutations in the S protein RCD.
In general, the S-protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's response is highly selective.
The RCD in SARS-CoV  is amino acids, from 318 to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its correceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV RCDs are capable of recognizing APF2 receptors in various animals, including bats, mice, mice and enot species, making it possible to transmit the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which differ from human and civet viral strains, and 4 of them are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civet has mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike-like protein to the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for the human adaptation of the virus.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of S protein leads to the possibility that the affinity of S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryophrenic microscope says that the affinity of this link is 1020 times higher than between human APF2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correceptors are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus to humans after interspecies transmission from carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other carrier dependence and restriction factors.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, camel-bellied mice and rodents, may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For HCoVs to be transmitted successfully between species, dependence factors must be usurped and carriers restricted.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-carrier interaction still need to be defined and categorized.
Improved results can be obtained through the use of CRISPR technology, which is a complete and impartial screening of dependence factors and carrier restriction for SARS-CoV-2.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to zero
The variety of bats' coronavirus creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bats' coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, acquiring or losing new genes that encode proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV-like bats viruses have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it's considered an adaptive mutation that speeds up the carrier shift.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
The recombination locations were also determined in nonstructural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which happened in camel-hounds in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs recombine with other animal coronavirus in their nonstructural genes.
It is also important to note that artificial breeding can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the virus being relieved of selective pressures, such as those of the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to bi-nucleotide deletion.
While the open-frame orf4 reading interaction can be observed in bats and camel viruses related to hCoV-229e, alpaca alpaca coronavirus displays a single nucleotide insertion, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to the selection pressure on their tank carriers.
In the case of bats infected with coronavirus, there were signs of poorly expressed or absent symptoms, suggesting a mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, the defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the inhibitory receptor apregulation of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of molecules of the major class I histosynchronous complex.
Moreover, the high levels of active oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while also affecting the exoribonuclease reading, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that, when penetrated into the new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the last 20 years.
Coronavirus are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their tank carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate safely without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
That's the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, the immune response of the symptom-free carriers is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response-free strategy can have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect in humans.
In addition, the bats have a disabling activation of NLRP3-inflammatory muscles.
Based on this, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammatory with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While the beta-coronavirus of bats has been found, whose nucleotide homology is 95% similar to SARS-CoV, there is also the coronavirus of bats, whose nucleotide homology is 96% similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that ticks and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
PANGOLINE beta-coronavirus have been discovered, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolines may have served as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of pangolin beta-coronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has attracted widespread attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoVs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wild markets and destroying civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of beta-coronavirus panoglycerin lines, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of the infection from food markets, panoglycerin should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how it can occur remains a matter for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been around for a long time in camel-hounds.
These camels are an important means of transportation and also a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local population.
They're widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to donate all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of disease.
There are a variety of zoonotic coronavirus circulating around the world.
In particular, there is a huge variety of coronavirus in bats with zoonotic potential.
There are a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.
To reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests like SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until they can take over new territories.
While many of the properties of bats are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized.
To better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful to prevent transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural zoonosis reservoirs.
There are still some fragments missing from the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats have transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, then we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal is the true intermediate, then we need to figure out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected cases of COVID-19 and confirmed cases need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief reference guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides proven recommendations for fighting the pandemic around the world.
However, the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; so diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and cite the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected cases of illness and confirmed cases in accordance with the Recommendation on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak of 2019 (2019-nCoV) occurred, which has now been officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a great deal of attention.
It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; so diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from January 16 to March 3, 2020, seven issues of the Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 document were published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with some of its provisions substantially changed.
Recently, Zhou's work with co-authors included a commentary on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable information on this global pandemic.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (trial version seven) and current research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (dated March 3, 2020), for conducting a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspicion of disease , one element of the epidemiological history characteristics must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or residence in Wuhan and its environs or other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive test on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases characterized by high temperature or respiratory symptoms, such as in a home, office, school, apartment, etc.) during 2 weeks.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) overall leukocyte counts are normal or low with reduced lymphocyte counts at an early stage of symptom manifestation.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on the suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronavirus; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody, or an increase in the titer at least 4 times in the recovery phase with respect to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document added a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; then the need for serological evidence was added in the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers who have been looking for the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
At the same time, there is growing evidence that caution is needed in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou's work, etc., should be updated, as it classifies people without clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence and urge readers to leave comments.
When it comes to diagnosing suspected cases and confirmed cases, we encourage readers to follow and follow the latest recommendations in their countries of residence.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19  daily maximum
Yesterday Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
That's the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases and 33 recovering patients who were at home were among the reported cases.
There were 17 deaths in total.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was 41 years old.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic employee told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait-based Maitrey Clinic.
On Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Motor Transport and Bridges, Obaydul Quader, said in an online video announcement that public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transportation was suspended from March 26 and was to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities  medicines, fuel and food  was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth infection mark worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52 thousand people have died from the coronavirus COVID-19.
The deadline came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first case of death from coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries that had not reported cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, of which at least 5,900 have resulted in death.
CBS News cited data from Johns Hopkins University to report that on Wednesday, more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States from coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the city's citizens until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin has said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously it only lasted from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand was planning to introduce curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state's home isolation regime has been extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia restrict the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages available to buy at a time in all stores across the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack restriction.
These restrictions were reported in advertisements at the box office and on the Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly began making emergency supplies out of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper it bought to one pack.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, Woolworths and Coles had already limited the number to four packages.
Coles's retail network in its March 8 press release reported that with the introduction of a four-pack restriction In many stores toilet paper is still being bought too quickly one delivery within an hour, and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend unexpected.
According to a Woolworths spokesman, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's Canberra store also limited that number to two packages last week.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stock for a special early-sales campaign on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish their inventory, but this was hampered by local authorities' restrictions on the timetable for trucks.
It expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to depletion of supplies, some stores could not hold Wednesday's events.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are refilling every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of storage stocks is small, and after the entire volume of goods is sold, long rows of shelves remain empty, exacerbating the feeling of shortage of supplies.
Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic,  says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced that it was out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent-branded products, said they are working around the clock to ensure a sufficient number of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate auction site, reported that when auctions in Melbourne were down due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day weekend, some real estate dealers began offering free toilet paper to first auction participants.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, at first stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items purchased, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantry, hand washing agents and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two 12-reel packages.
World health organization announces COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" only describes the extent of the disease, rather than the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take measures:
All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.
This is possible if countries are engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, surveillance of cases and mobilization of their citizens, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhan Ghebreyesus said.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming level of disease prevalence and severity and by the alarming level of inaction
According to Dr. Tom Friedin, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is unprecedented.
He said in an interview on CNN in February that no other respiratory virus other than the flu has been tracked since its onset until its continued global spread.
Mr. Gebreissus expressed a similar view, saying that we have never seen a coronavirus pandemic.
We've also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then gave it a new status of  pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse".
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
20192020 coronavirus pandemic  is the current pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was later declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are possible complications.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering for cough, distance between people, identification and self-isolation of people who suspect their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closing down various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of students worldwide.
There has been a lot of misinformation about the virus on the Internet, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who look like them, and other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan City (capital of Hubei Province), China, reported an unknown cause of pneumonia, and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huan, so the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus that has a strong resemblance to bats coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, a non-verified publication by the southern Chinese branch of the newspaper Morning Post suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but had increased unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new infections outside China had exceeded the number of new infections in China itself for the first time.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular because of the large number of cases with poorly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.
The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy has been adopted requiring that testing be avoided if only minor symptoms are present.
A study published on March 16 showed that up to January 23, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China, and that such unregistered patients became the source of infection for 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the base reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, the most common period being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of those who died had related diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID testing results, which were carried out according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be much higher, as official figures may not include those who have died without having been tested  for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data across Italy suggests that the actual death toll during the pandemic was 45 times higher than the official COVID figures.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than actual. His words are confirmed by reports of some individual cases in the U.S. This incomplete record is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia  in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.
All indicators vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global death rate and infection rate is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data varies by region.
In China, the mortality-to-infection ratio has dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that began on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that began after 1 February 2020).Other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR)  percent of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the performance of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Center for Evidence Medicine, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The top of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the outbreak are not defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mace Bonney, an employee at Penn State University, claims that uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually go up the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers runs out, they start to go out.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshang says that it could all be over by June if all countries can mobilize and follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 will circulate, perhaps within a year or two.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, until a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more) physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a Vanderbilt University employee, says, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away for good, because it's so easily transmitted, and it can become a seasonal disease, starting every year".
The virulence of the new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, airway spotting (slizzing), loss of smell, breathlessness, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, rash, vomiting, blood clots, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six people develop serious respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as shortness of breath, constant pain or feeling cramped in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips.
Some infected people may have the disease asymptomatic as a result of no clinical signs, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that people in close contact with patients who have been diagnosed be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of the disease's asymptomatic course ranges from a few to 44 percent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is no complete clarity on the symptoms of odor loss yet: the initial estimate of the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed the symptom was initially 30%, then dropped to 15%.
Some details about the ways the disease spread are still unknown.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small droplets that protrude into the air along with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, when coughing openly, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There is speculation that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during conversation, which are able to remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets may also form when breathing, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of people around them, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests have been positive three days before the symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmission of the virus before the symptoms are manifested.
There are only a few reported cases of asymptomatic disease in the laboratory, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also found cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 23 other people.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on cardboard surfaces  for one day, and on copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.
However, this data varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected humans may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by using household soap that dissolves its protective shell.
It's supposed to be zoonotic.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus genus (cell line B) along with two other strains of bats viruses.
On a whole genome level, it's 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the sequences of the pangolin and human virus genomes.
A total genome comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this must ultimately be confirmed by analysis of the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or by computed tomography.
A study comparing the PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of these was published on January 17.
Testing for polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is being conducted .
It can be done on breathing samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready in a period of hours to days.
Usually, a nasal spray is used for the test, although a saliva spray can also be used.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to obtain approval for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging include asymmetrical peripheral blurring of the matte glass type and absence of pleural protrusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the international database of confirmed cases.
Because of similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT and PCR testing, and it was found that while the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decoded faster; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
For the diagnosis of the virus using X-rays and computed tomography, a clustered neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public.
Many governments recommend that people avoid any early travel to the countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread to most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among a population whose members do not know where or how they were infected. Medical workers who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection.
Governments' use of location data from their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data  for example, registering a user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, they receive a notification, and there are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection , such as rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when your hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before meals, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap that opens its protective shell.
Also, if soap and water are unavailable, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (stainless steel surface disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) containing 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% 7.5% iodine.
Other components, such as benzaloconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the event of suspected or confirmed COVID in an institution such as an office or daycare center, all spaces in such a facility, including offices, toilets, public facilities, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by patients, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that you cover your mouth and nose with a back elbow or a napkin and throw away any used hygiene items immediately.
Those who may have been infected are advised to wear medical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and range of respiratory products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, using a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands  is the main way to get infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing a mask can actually reduce the number of facial contact.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, USA, recommends wearing tissue face masks for non-medical purposes. China has specifically stressed the importance of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand urge people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks that cover their noses and mouths.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required all food store visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks are produced daily since mid-March, medical masks were required for all passengers on trains and inter-city buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going out; residents who cannot afford to wear a mask are advised to sew them at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing)  is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions, particularly those heavily affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people who could gather in one place as recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned groups of more than two people. Older people and individuals suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, hypertension, and weakened immune systems are at increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if the region is experiencing an outbreak.
The use of the term "social distancing" was understood to mean that people should completely isolate themselves from others rather than stay in contact with others in alternative ways.
Among other things, it has been recommended that you only have sex with your permanent partner, who you live with, and who you are sure has no virus or symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Healthcare institutions have published detailed self-isolation instructions, and governments in many countries have also made it mandatory or recommended that all affected areas self-quarantine.
Those in high-risk groups were put under strict quarantine.
Individuals who may have had contact with COVID-19 infected people or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic were advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
Outbreak strategies include curbing the spread of the disease, suppressing or mitigating it.
The disease is controlled at an early stage and is intended to monitor and isolate those infected, and includes other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppressing infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the epidemic curve alignment.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and allow more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community engagement to help implement and participate in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, as well as a system of alerting people to the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to infected individuals in self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and drug surplus has been fined, and modelling across the UK and US has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (slowing the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the disease could reduce the peak burden on the health system by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to quell the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and breathing support.
Steroid use can only hurt.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some traditional and home remedies may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to promote the redistribution of resources at multiple levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling timeless procedures wherever possible, identifying the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care facilities through staff training and increasing the number of available IVA devices and beds.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection, the so-called "zero patient", may have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus infection was likely reported on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province has been increasing gradually.
They were mainly linked to the wholesale market of seafood in Hunan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of a mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in a Hubei province clinic, with which a doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, who reported the case on December 27 to the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan City.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's central clinic warned their colleagues about the coronavirus, similar to SARS.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police that they were responsible for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was dismissed by her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported an unknown number of cases of pneumonia, which was large enough to be investigated in early January, and the number of cases in the early stages of the outbreak was doubling roughly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, fueled by the Chinese New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a major transportation and rail hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms of the disease. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy in the world in the largest number of confirmed cases.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory home confinement, mandatory home shelter or isolation), and a curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people  in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that number increased to 2.6 billion people -- about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the accuracy of the information has not been verified, this date is  17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jishian was working with a case of a massive pneumonia of unknown type, and on December 27, her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan.
The initial genetic testing of patients' samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for spreading rumors about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence of the ability of the newly discovered virus to spread from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed the People's War by Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
The events of the largest quarantine in human history began to unfold, with a sanitary cordon and a ban on entering Wuhan and back on January 23, later extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned private transportation.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations were canceled (January 25).
The authorities also announced the construction of the Huoshenshang Temporary Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, Leishenshan, was built, which took in other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also re-profiled 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular, against schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have imposed remote working.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei and beyond.
The schedule for public transportation was changed, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced a regime of citizen movement control, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of restrictions on outdoor movement.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city, and as of March 23, mainland China has only had one case of domestic transmission of the infection five days earlier, in this case from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the domestically transmitted disease has largely been stopped, and the outbreak in China has been brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei except Wuhan were lifted, two months after the province was closed to quarantine.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume work and provided companies with a package of monetary stimulus measures. On April 4, at 10:00 a.m., a national three-minute minute silence was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, announced by the country's State Council and coinciding with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to those who died online, maintaining physical distancing to avoid a repeat outbreak of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Health Ministry reported a significant increase in confirmed cases of the disease, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Shinchongji Church.
Shinchongji's followers arrived in Tag from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 (about 13%) of the church's 9,336 followers reported having symptoms of the disease.
On February 28, Korea recorded more than 2,000 confirmed cases, and on February 29, the figure rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, so airline flight schedules were changed. South Korea has deployed a program to screen for the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons.
Screening methods included making it mandatory to inform all those who came from abroad about their symptoms via a mobile app, criminal testing for the virus, whose results were ready the next day, and expanding testing capabilities to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak, despite the fact that it has not isolated entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for the impeachment of Moon for what they felt was the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, a message came that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries applied to South Korea for help testing for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Quma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individual individuals will be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit inter-city travel, but intensive travel between cities continued before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Quma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, when Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the wake of claims to conceal the extent of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked cases of their own with Iran, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch (On Human Rights Watch) called on Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners fit for this category.
The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number of deaths in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By March 23, Iran had recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from the coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to a WHO official, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than the official data.
It is also suggested that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capabilities in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran, be eased.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases has been rising rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A cluster of unrelated cases of COVID-19 were later discovered. It all started with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, which put more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entrance into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy.
All major sporting events, including A-series football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9 all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Therapy (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for the establishment of orderly medical care for patients, which may need to be engaged.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in death rates from coronavirus, taking first place in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, with most of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that the combination of two factors could contribute to such a high mortality rate in Italy: the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the lack of access to all those currently infected with the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus most calmly of all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not require citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously enough to the danger that the country's population was facing. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that people refrain from all trips and non-essential social contacts, offering people to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens up to 80% of wages, but no more than £2,500 a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by police, fines and crowd-pleasing.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those that provide the people's livelihoods, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, grocery stores, auto refueling stations and garages.
On January 20, in Pacific Northwest Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed to have the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the White House established a Task Force on the fight against coronavirus.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on entry for people arriving from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own set of tests.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the lack of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government permission until the end of February to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and the restrictive criteria before early March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by prescription from a treating physician).
The Washington Post reported that as of February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that as of March 13, fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and doctor appointments, waited for their test shifts for hours or days". After Washington State reported the first coronavirus death in the United States on February 29, Governor Jay Innsley declared a state of emergency, which was soon followed by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were canceled, and by mid-March, schools were closed nationwide. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the new coronavirus outbreak's outlook for the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Act on Additional Appropriations for Preparedness and Response to the Coronavirus, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations have imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days, beginning March 13.
The next day, he extended the restrictions, including the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which allowed federal funds to be used to combat the crisis.
Starting March 15, many companies have started shutting down or cutting hours throughout the United States to help fight the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that New York had recorded 10,700 cases per day, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing is likely to be an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases have dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, New York City had 32,308 confirmed cases, and 672 people had died. It was reported that on March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports from March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the social distancing period until April 30.
On the same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort was docked in New York Harbor.
On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3, and the White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring open access information, by using the office of Vice President Mike Pence to monitor public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
Overall, President Trump's supporters have divided their opinions on how successfully he manages to handle the crisis.
Some officials and observers have criticized the U.S. reliance on importing critical materials, including essential goods, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel schemes that was used to map and predict disease outbreaks.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the most travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also popular destinations for these tourists.
Out of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared.
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in a situation of threat.
On March 21, Australia declared a state of emergency in the field of human biosecurity.
Thanks to the effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, which the Chinese authorities have given their permission to.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has said it will not evacuate its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/relatives of Brazilians, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.
Citizens of Poland, China and India landed in Poland, where a Brazilian plane made a stop before departing for Brazil according to the route.
Brazilian citizens who visited Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near the city of Brasilia.
On the same day, 215 Canadian citizens (176 people from the first and 39 from the second aircraft chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan, taken to the Canadian Forces Base Trenton and quarantined for two weeks.
On February 11, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadian citizens also taken out of Wuhan landed at CFB Trenton.
On 3 and 4 February, the Australian authorities evacuated 277 of their citizens and placed them in a temporary residence centre on Christmas Island, which was converted into a quarantine centre, where they remained for 14 days.
On February 5, a New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland; its passengers (including some from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region) were quarantined at the naval base in Vangaparoa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
On February 21, the plane with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Princess of the Diamond landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
The passengers were given a medical examination before the flight, and four South Africans who had been found to have coronavirus were left in China to mitigate their risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
All South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, were tested and as a precaution all were monitored and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq in connection with the pandemic.
On February 5, China's Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent their aid to China.
Some Chinese students studying at American universities have united to collect and send aid to the virus-affected regions of China, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei Provincial clinics on January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to finance the development of a vaccine and treatment for coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of the risk groups of Africa and South Asia from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was sending China $2.26 million in aid.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent over 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
He also later sent 5,000 kits for testing, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVA machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada, and the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which were only 30 percent accurate, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 failed Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable medical masks, thought to have been made in China, but later found to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank began implementing emergency aid operations to developing countries.
WHO has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the 2002-04 outbreak of atypical pneumonia, in which Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy, which allegedly prevented the disease from spreading and contained its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, in which the central government regularly provided updated information about the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that although the measure was definitely recommended by not WHO, it is also a very important confirmation of the implementation of the epidemic containment obligation in the most widespread area, and called it unprecedented in public health history. On 30 January, after the ability of the infection to spread from person to person outside China and the growth of infections in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared a public health emergency in the international public health system (PHEIC); this was the sixth such situation since 2009 when the measure was first applied during the pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC announcement was driven by the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack reliable healthcare systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said there was no reason for measures that would unnecessarily hinder international travel and trade and that WHO did not recommend restricting trade and movement.
On 5 February, WHO asked the global community to allocate US$675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, informing of the need to provide emergency assistance to those countries that do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries.
Mr Tedros also stated that  indicator of our readiness  is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link, and urged the international community to make a choice: invest today or pay in the future. At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established the official name of  COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros announced that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the full potential of the UN system in response to the problem.
The result was the creation of the UN Crisis Management Group, which coordinates all United Nations response measures; these steps, WHO says, will allow it to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak on a broader social and economic level.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint special group that provided international experts and WHO staff in China to help resolve the situation inside the country and assess the seriousness of the disease and its contagion, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, and visits to assess the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and county level, including urban and rural areas. On 25 February, WHO said that the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that it is too early to call this disease a pandemic, but countries should be prepared for this.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint task force to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials announced that the probability of global coronavirus spread would be increased with the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, WHO's Executive Director for Emergency Health, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet's readiness for the real thing: it's time to act.
The virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, and he also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a worst-case scenario.
Ryan also said that the current data is not a basis for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that we "really recognize the fact that every person on the planet is at risk of contracting the virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a pandemic.
WHO Director-General stated that WHO is deeply concerned both by the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and by the alarmingly low level of inaction in relation to the problem. WHO is being criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the pandemic, including the later declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition was filed to resign to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said that everyone has the right to life-saving measures and that the government is responsible for organising them.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless people, citizens living in extreme conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to share views and make recommendations.
The digital hub contains information on the country policy tracker to strengthen health systems and the global economy, eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gow and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their efforts to combat the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these fires indicated dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have expressed disagreement with a previous statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but have sided with a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a Chinese virus or Wuhan virus, saying that censorship in China only makes the situation worse with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and distracts from the US president's administration's inability to curb the spread of the disease.
The Daily Beast has access to a U.S. government telegram containing a communications strategy trick, apparently devised by the National Security Council; there are also references to the strategy: It's all about China.
We are being asked to spread this information through any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances.  Organizations like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus  are part of a propaganda effort to gain global influence.
The head of the EU's foreign ministry, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component" that includes a struggle for influence through publicity and a so-called "generous policy".
Borrell also stated that China is steadfastly promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US.
China also urged the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and, according to some reports, to send aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned due to US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid to other countries to their own countries.
There were also disputes over medical masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of aircraft intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said only China had reacted in a bilateral manner.
This is not a clear sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the sending of Russian military sanitizers, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous high-level political source as saying that 80% of Russian aid was useless or little useful for Italy.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a positive impression on the world at the geopolitical and diplomatic levels.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo have rejected media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the help they have received.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that by offering assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to provide counter-assistance if necessary.
NATO military exercises Defender-2020, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries  the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War  will be conducted in a shortened format.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise (Defender 2020) : In the current public health crisis, the exercise is putting at risk not only the lives of the US military and many European countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries where such events are to be held.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addressed a letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political scientists expected this to have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "unambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for the impeachment of Muon for what they felt was an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
Some commentators are concerned that this move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend parliament, as well as hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic buying and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which have been driven by increased consumer demand and failures in suppliers.
In several settlements, panic shopping also took place, leading to the disappearance of essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the shelves of shops, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the tech industry is warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This jump has led to a 20-fold increase in prices over normal prices, as well as a four- to six-month delay in medical supplies.
It's also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that health workers would be under attack for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigou customers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illegal trade in critical products, which proved successful, avoided the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, which has a small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products may rise.
The shelves of the grocery stores were only temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies to provide a full diet for the population.
Similar laws require food producers to store food supplies in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: According to media reports dated March 16, China's economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5% decline in retail sales.
Mainland China  is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to Agate Demaray, an Economist Intelligence Unit employee, market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential outcomes is available.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth may outweigh the effects of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to one estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, the global supply chain could be damaged by more than $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly taking "temporary measures" after the sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed their sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow index falling to 1191 points  the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
By the end of the week, all three indices had shown a decline of more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
Shares fell again over fears of coronavirus outbreak, with the biggest drop coming on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian has praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chong-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events involving large numbers of people, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland independently.
Many New Year's events were canceled, and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Forbidden City in Beijing was closed and traditional temple fairs were canceled.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the response rate to infectious diseases to a high and declared a state of emergency by closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations.
Retail retail visits in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retail businesses in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 percent.
As a result, in March, the number of visitors to shopping centers fell by 3343% compared to February.
Worldwide, shopping center operators have introduced additional measures such as improving sanitation, installing visitor temperature checking equipment, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 1422 million more people behind poverty than it would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were either at home in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei province.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause 47 million people in the United States to lose their jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers without jobs, receiving daily pay. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have been unemployed in one way or another.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social allowance.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have sought to support their (often state-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, and, wherever possible, by supporting people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them was limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were canceled or moved to other dates.
Another recent and growing trend is the spread of the virus, which has led to the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Easter Week in Rome, which is held on the last week of the Christian penitential period  Great Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have been broadcast on radio, live or television, while leaders in some churches suggest that worship services be held outdoors.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship services and restricted access to public worship services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been canceled or postponed, including the 2019 UEFA Champions League, the 2019 UEFA Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019 NBA season and the 2019 NHL season.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be moved to a period after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021. Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either moved or canceled.
This has led to many players switching to online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in new subscribers.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their productions.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore ways to continue their work and share their results online, organize live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue performing, producing or publishing their works.
There have been many coronavirus-themed internet memes on the Internet, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxiety that is typical of periods of uncertainty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been a sharpening of prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as to the populations of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February newsletters (when most cases were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for something.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also rising in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those in the affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread to new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a major COVID-19 outbreak; citizens of these regions may also begin to feel the effects of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition at an early stage, insisting that Chinese citizens be banned from entering their countries to curb the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon't ComeToJapan) was the number one hashtag on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report rising levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a Chinese virus; critics consider this opinion to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjara.
Students coming from India's northeastern China border and studying in India's major cities reported cases of persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing, West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and that God had avenged them.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "deception". In China, the pandemic again caused xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents: foreigners were called "foreign garbage" and "objects to be used".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific papers about the coronavirus outbreak public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on print publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It's used to confirm relatively recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests can identify the number of people who have the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be taken to the hospital or absent at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the information about the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.
These differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries can be greatly exaggerated.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract obtained by various methods, including a nasal swab or a sputum sample.
The results are usually available within a period of a few hours to 2 days.
The OTC-PCR test, performed on a squeeze taken from the throat, is only valid for the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but it can still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested at the second week of the disease, the material from the lower respiratory tract may be taken with an absorbent catheter or with food (mocrate) as an alternative.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Shariet clinic in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets that were later distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its own test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on a clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the E gene, common to all beta-coronavirus viruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to receive approval from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its diagnostic panel through the International Reagent Resource organization for real-time PCR (2019-Novel-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health labs.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits yielded incomplete results due to failed reagents and the narrow testing area being conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; the result was that, throughout February 2020, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed on average per day.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local labs allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency use permit.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has been testing for COVID-19 nationwide since March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; the collection and processing of the tests must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for use of the test, which can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; earlier, the FDA had issued similar permits to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can detect a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody is currently being developed in Taiwan that binds to a specific way to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and hopes to yield results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A review of the March 2020 specialized literature concludes that chest x-rays have little diagnostic value at an early stage, whereas CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.
Typical features detected during CT include two-sided multi-sided subpleural sealing focuses of the matte glass type with a peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteoric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptoms of the pebble bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after 7 days of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population control purposes. Analyses can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnostics (PoCT).
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by highly-performing automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each such system is produced.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may be used to track immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually taken by skin piercing.
Unlike PCR, the blood collection stage is not required for a test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use permit test. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The test yields several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than a conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, the UK found that none of the antibody tests it had purchased were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of the virus to stay at home: Emergency department staff hand over a sample sample to the patient, the patient spits in it, returns it, and after some time receives test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot home-testing scheme for suspected cases that eliminates the risk of infection from patients from other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During the COVID-19 express test for suspect cases, the healthcare worker takes analysis, using all appropriate precautions.
The express testing centers helped South Korea to organise one of the fastest and largest testing procedures in the world. On March 2, the National Association of Medical Compulsory Insurance Physicians in Germany announced that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier it could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's total testing performance is 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken for SARS-CoV-2 up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample shows a positive result.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such a fast pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the quarantine costs would have been twice as high.
After the opening of the Wuhan laboratory, Hu Yan's laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai  in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the daily overall pass rate was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays schemes have been released that can test up to 1,122 COVID-19 patient tests using just 93 screws.
By March, due to a shortage and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, UK and USA was becoming problematic.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols, which provide for heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the per capita coronavirus testing currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates is higher than that of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct express testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their Huo-Yang Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
This lab, which was deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first large-scale laboratory in the world to operate outside of China.
Different testing options targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol, developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was not available until January 28, which led to a lack of test kits in the U.S. At the very beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of test kits in China and the U.S., and these countries, as well as Australia, could not provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, experts say that the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for more testing programs to be developed as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States that received hundreds of thousands of test samples were overloaded and stocks of smear materials and chemical reagents were rapidly running out.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "deficiencies", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the cause of the inaccuracy of the results could be a failure to sample or misuse of the sets.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall the sets that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other sets  by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets that Slovakia purchased from China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested dropping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a high error rate and the Ministry was not using them.
The quarantine measures for people whose tests have been positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the observation of people who have been in contact with such patients, have been positive.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive contact monitoring, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and it did not require extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began urging residents to stay home, but schools, which closed on March 23, reopened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were performed than the number of deaths, the mortality rate was much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of WHO's 16 control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control labs are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
The following chart shows the column % of positive results depending on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of symptoms, under equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands to remove contaminants, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular handwashing with soap at certain critical times during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted fecal-oral.
A person can also get respiratory diseases, such as the flu or a common cold, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are unavailable, you can use a hand sanitizer.
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after a patient's care procedure.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the bathroom.
After a dizziness, cough or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or waste.
Hand hygiene refers to the hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will help prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as of chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it's also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very healthy, for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight increase in the growth rate of children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as handwashing with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory illness (ARD) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school, and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of OCD, is the leading cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children annually.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after toileting, a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrheal mortality by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents the development of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to dry skin and, consequently, to skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too often washing your hands can lead to itching and skin rashes  to a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too often washing hands can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical" moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (bowel movement, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other cases where hand washing is necessary to prevent disease transmission include before or after cutting or wound treatment, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries handwashing with soap is not common.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap  is common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States is nearer the middle, with  77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China  23%. There are currently several methods to change behavior and develop the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Medical Assistance Program implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of large-scale measures to strengthen children's health and raise children's education.
The national program is based on de-gelsmination, which is done twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap and daily fluoridation of teeth.
The same program is successfully being conducted in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is more effective when soap or detergents are added to the wash.
The main function of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleanser because the fat and protein components of organic contaminants are poorly soluble in water.
However, sufficient water helps to purify the water.
Hard soap, due to its repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it when used before.
A small number of studies on how contaminated pieces of solid soap can get into the skin suggest that the chances of getting into the skin are low because the bacteria wash off with foam.
The CDC still claims that liquid hand-dose soap is the preferred option for hand washing.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, the antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which is resistant to many resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substances and skin protection agents, complex compounds can contain acids (oxygen, ascorbic, lactic) as pH regulators, as well as antimicrobial active benzene acid and other respirators (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Oregon School of Public Health University has shown that simple soap varieties are as effective at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands as conventional triclose-containing antibacterial soap.
Hot water at a comfortable temperature for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at 37°C.
However, hot soap water is more effective at removing natural fats that contain contaminants and bacteria than cold soap.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer  is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-free alcohol-based hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, hand sanitizers, and antiseptics) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, which provide convenience for using these products and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 is similar to 35 decibels) on the hands within 30 seconds of application and 99.99%  99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 45) on the hands within 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The face and back of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you choose to wash your hands rather than use disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not replace the use of water and soap to wash your hands properly.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol drying on the skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other softeners to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact lumpy syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower chance of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not clean hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as regular soap and water, because when used, pathogenic microorganisms still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of a hand sanitizer that does not contain alcohol is largely dependent on its components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than alcohol or alcohol-containing drugs.
Recently, it has been proven that drugs containing benzodiazepine chloride have a stable and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Salt or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or brass is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, brass is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control recommends hand washing, which includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
It's recommended that you use running water because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water is not important.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, and the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when people use soap (not just one water) they tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under running water.
Hands in standing water can cause a recurrence of infection.
Wipe your hands off with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to be contaminated, and people often overlook areas such as the thumb, wrist, between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizer to prevent the skin drying out of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are unavailable, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pour water from a hanging canister or bottle pump with holes made and (or) use a sink if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as pedal faucets and other inexpensive options.
A crane with a pedal is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a pedal lever that must be pressed to pour water on the hands; a piece of soap must be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
The growing amount of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London sponsored a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Tissue and Towels, which compared the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying your hands in a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on your finger pads increases by an average of 194%, and on your palms by 254%.
It also found that after washing and drying your hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on your finger pads increases by 42 percent, and on your palms by 15 percent.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips on the pillows decreases by an average of 76 percent, and on the palms by 77 percent.
A streamlined air dryer that produces air at a declared speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph) is capable of blowing microorganisms out of its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and sanctuary in a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters of the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study evaluating the various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are often compared to paper towels.
Hand cleaning with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
Hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in a stationary setting.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to.
According to one study, using such devices actually helps to reduce infection.
Medical hand washing takes at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water or gel used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
The hands should be carefully rubbed together, with the fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, you should use a paper towel to close the crane and, if necessary, to close and open any doors.
This prevents further hand contamination from these surfaces.
Handwashing in medical facilities is intended to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: Many doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with catheters by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet that illustrates the standard hand washing and handling procedures that should be used in the healthcare sector.
The draft WHO Hand Hygiene Directive is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
A corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authored form.
If compliance with the regulations is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization identifies five times when you should wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptics, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when you wash your hands (medical soap or antimicrobial soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Hand cleaning requires a crane that can be turned on and off without touching the hands; a little chlorhexidine or iodine water should also be used to polish the hands, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing, a sterile brush for rubbing and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow for 26 minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands too long, like, 10 minutes.
During rinse, the water from the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After the washing is completed, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after a patient's care procedure.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing benefits the most, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap, washing hands with regular soap results in more than three times the frequency of foodborne bacterial infections. A comparison of handwashing with alcohol-containing soap and handwashing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that handwashing with alcohol-containing soap reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohols in reducing the number of hands with the H1N1 influenza A virus and the Clostidium diffisilla disorder. Hand hygiene measures in medical facilities may include training staff to wash their hands, increasing availability of hand alcohol solutions, and writing and verbal reminders of the need to wash their hands.
Further studies on the most effective measures in various medical institutions are required.
In developing countries, soap handwashing is recognized as an economically effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to get into the habit of washing your hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a handwashing tap, although there are also cheap ways to organize handwashing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, not by a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in the behavior of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-level sanitary and epidemiological supervision is effective in improving hand hygiene in low-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of handwashing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach: It promotes simple economic measures to encourage students to wash their hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that the minimum standards are met, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Installing hand sanitizers is one of the possible measures being implemented in the framework of hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce the level of infant mortality and morbidity.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of a campaign to change behavior. In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of hand washing emoji.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that encouraging handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health  especially for vulnerable groups of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and founder of modern patient care.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotting odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of diseases transmitted through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
With the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, hand washers were hung in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports, alongside hand washers.
The phrase "wash your hands" means you don't want to take responsibility for anything or be a part of something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: "Pontius Pilate washed his hands" when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; later, this phrase gained wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to clear herself of the imagined stain, symbolizing a defiled conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed some unethical act tended to wash their hands more often than other people, and hand washing was more important to them.
Also, people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it are less likely to participate in any other cleaning activities, such as volunteering.
Hand washing is a symbolic ritual in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, hand washing is considered necessary before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of manufacturing factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the use of methods to ensure labor safety and health protection in order to control the risks and fight the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control is a workplace and job-based approach based on risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene Administration (OSHA) reported that low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home for signs of illness, adhering to respiratory etiquette, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers who have contact with the public, such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and morgue staff who have come into contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; the risk increases to a very high level when such staff perform procedures that accompany the formation of aerosols or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate to such personnel include the use of safety engineering equipment such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate to the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have different types of impact in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both with respect to the types of goods that are in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g. shopping during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions to the delivery of goods from the geographic regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address issues of risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors in homes and communities, and individual employee risk factors such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to address these risks and the emergency action plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the targets for the response to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response measures are influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
Risk management hierarchy  is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such resources according to efficiency.
When the risk of COVID-19 is not eliminated, safety engineering is the most effective, followed by administrative measures and finally personal protective equipment.
Safety engineering means that employees are isolated from work-related hazardous areas and do not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most economically advantageous solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in labour policies or procedures that require action from the employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be chosen according to the threat to the employee, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used consistently and appropriately, regularly checked, maintained in good condition and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed to avoid infection.
The US Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene Administration (OSHA) believes that low-risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including hand-closing for coughing and sneezing, provision of hand sanitation and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of people who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever stops, no body temperature and many other symptoms stop for at least 24 hours without using heat-lowering agents or other medications that eliminate symptoms, and recommends that policy flexibility be ensured in hospital records, employees be allowed to stay home to care for a sick family member, and employees be informed of such policies.
According to OSHA, positions with an average risk level require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there are no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but who are likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or due to such person's recent travel to places of COVID-19.
These categories include workers who have had contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density workplaces and some large retail stores. Safety engineering measures for such groups and groups with higher risk include setting up high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation intensity, setting up physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens and customer service windows for exit from the car. Administrative measures for such groups and groups with higher risk include advising sick workers to stay at home, replace personal communication meetings with virtual devices, or set up a timetable that does not include stopping travel with critical devices, but may include providing staff with information on the need to protect themselves from COVID-19, and providing for the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment, training and equipment to prevent COVID-19, and providing staff with information on the need to use personal protective equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment, and the use of COVID-19 safety equipment, and the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment, and equipment for the use of emergency situations, and the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 safety, and emergency situations, and the use of personal protective equipment for the use of emergency services.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on the plane, such measures as isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person, giving the sick person a mask or asking the sick person to cover their nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure proper safety for the staff and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially infected surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if they have a fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Handcuffs and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include delaying travel in case of illness, self-isolation and promptly informing the medical center on board if anyone on board has heat or other symptoms.
Ideally, the medical examination should be conducted in the isolation room of such a person. In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
With a minimum or average spread of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling trips to meet in person, gatherings and other mass events, such as physical activity or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, adjusting arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, measures to prevent long-term school absence may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical practitioners, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their seat belts and equipment before re-use by means of household air fresheners or by rubbing, observe standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and disposal of used personal protective equipment, and for using and washing clothing.
OSHA considers that some categories of healthcare and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they are taking aerosol-containing procedures or when they are collecting/processing samples from people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The procedures that accompany the formation of aerosol include probing, procedures that cause cough, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers include staff who treat the bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 illness or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff perform an autopsy, they are assigned to the very high-risk category. Additional safety engineering for these risk groups include the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed COVID-19 illness or suspected COVID-19, including when conducting procedures that accompany the formation of aerosols.
In some healthcare facilities and morgues, a good measure may be negative pressure ventilation.
Samples should be handled with due regard to the precautions provided for in biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be assigned to a defined waiting area based on suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective measures, OSHA recommends that workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons undergoing procedures that accompany the formation of aerosols, use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators for individuals with N95 or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection of medications and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend wearing special clothing because COVID-19  is a respiratory disease, not a physiological fluid.
WHO recommends that surgical masks only be used for screening staff at the point of admission.
WHO recommends that people who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face protective screen, gowns and gloves.
When performing procedures that involve the formation of aerosols, a N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of individual protection around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection by using remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, providing access to a COVID-19 patient only to those who provide immediate care, using only the personal protection that is needed for a specific task, continuously using the same breathing apparatus without removing, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection products for multiple patients with the same diagnoses, and recommending that no masks be used for those without symptoms.

TEMP: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The date and time of the correction is: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: Protected rights are missing
This month we're living in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the connections of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which underlies such an organization.
We've seen the friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, which is reflected in the e-mail, the calls and the chats -- a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I am so grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was told that our work was highly appreciated.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible because of your work, whether it's making websites work, paying our colleagues, or protecting communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia has, and it's more important than ever.
At a time when achieving meaningful results for the world, it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to our joint work starting next week.
Adjusting our work schedule and schedule
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the meeting, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect to work about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before we get our next orders.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work longer hours normally, that's allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether it's caring for family, buying groceries, or going to the doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We're not monitoring your working hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't be working.
It's clear and undeniable, but we're talking about it.
No hospital leaflet or leave is required: simply inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, tell Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the guidance team for your situation).
The hourly rate will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with our contractors and employees' obligations at the hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to the usual hourly rates used under normal circumstances.
This includes sickness periods when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can have amazing results, especially at times like these.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to contact your supervisor so that we can know what to expect and adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We should always support these kinds of activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We're initiating a process for all units to assess current targets and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
A delay today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We don't plan to work twice as hard to make up for lost money after the pandemic.
You don't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What 's going on with the APP ?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily work hours, we intend to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to offer an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time to budget, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while providing everyone who needs or wants to work a shortened schedule for the next few weeks.
Such extension of time limits significantly reduces the ongoing planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week we'll present our proposal to the Council, providing representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps immediately upon receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to the numerous precautions, we hired a virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception halls and elevator halls that allowed access to our floor.
The building has its own rules that require care and use products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the time when we decide to return.
Our District of Columbia (DC) office is on the Web site of WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 rules with us and all staff in DC.
Last week, our District of Columbia office moved completely to remote operations in accordance with the San Francisco directions.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we've also been discussing renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the length of meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider breaking them into a course of a few days.

Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded mass events like editathons until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and inform that our requests for such delays and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such objectives.
Next week we will be hosting additional events with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community  is not only the sadness of the break, but also a sense of relief from the understanding and the ability to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and more.
As for the prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to track interactions and interactions.
We're in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting on Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we'll take the opportunity to share more up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're willing to help anyone we can.
You can still get information from this email and other important COVID-19 information from Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be gathered in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, information issues or other assistance, please contact CRT.
We're ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have any privacy issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a departure from our work and our commitments.
Rather, it's a recognition of the potential current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
To do this, we need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as hard as possible as you can when that needs to happen.
Now, please wash your hands and keep your face away!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing its Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for treating cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-terminal peptide domain of M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid colectin.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaze, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 and RNA biosynthesis is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks up the hormone angiotensin I into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, separates the carboxylated end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartneup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires priming of S protein by TMPRSS2 serine protease carrier, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour duration of exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising agent for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases with increased circulating angiotensin II. Introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile phone apps designed to help with epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several variants of the contact tracking application have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Softer options include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based support functionality for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, it's an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-powered StopKorona! app that helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides an operational connection with health authorities.
The app was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to be registered in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on the Singaporean TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use a geo-zoning app to  monitor COVID-19 patients living in Moscow from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false starts and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by only a small percentage of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus applications, Apple has limited the list of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, including only official or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaign participants expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to fight the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of supervision.
The organizations announced eight conditions they set for state projects:
The monitoring must be legal, necessary and proportionate.
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall be accompanied by reservations on limiting the period of validity;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties shall be determined at the level of the legislation;
the protection against abuse and the right of citizens to react to abuse should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their terms and conditions.
Google and Apple are offering a joint plan to address the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device's operating systems as soon as it's no longer necessary.
Some countries use network location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to the original location data also have a large potential privacy problem.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidentiality-protected systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts without using applications as a basis.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected people, but also made location information publicly available, which was made possible by the significant changes in information protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in this country.
The information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Contact tracking, which maintains privacy  is an established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-enhancing solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and that all matches are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location or crossroads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research presented in the document Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic (Apps-Chouliers: How to Keep Privacy During an Epidemic), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential location and health information with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was founded by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the goal of  reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and notification applications, which is a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code, used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the operation of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would provide privacy, and is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to keep privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deploying tools that allow governments to create official apps to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address the ongoing surveillance issues by first implementing the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way once the threat is gone.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, re-direction, task change or therapeutic re-direction of drugs)  is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally envisaged in development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treating COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of recovert plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are susceptible to drug interactions, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a good basis for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicaxa, S protein and ADF-ribophosphatease.
Hussein A.A. and co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical trials.
Chlorohyn is an anti-malarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chlorophyll and related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being studied in the clinical trial Solidability.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chlorine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24.
The treatment regimen was not approved by the FDA during the clinical trial process and is only approved under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimen.
The CDC stated that the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established.

Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipirivir is unambiguously effective.
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took this drug, the negative result was achieved in an average of four days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study was conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received favipirivir, and the other half received  umfenovir.

One study, which combined the antiviral drugs lopinvir and ritonavir (Caletra), concluded that the efficacy of the drugs was not established.
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international test Solidability.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections, and later found to have antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phyl-, pneumonia-, paramix-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two being conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one being conducted on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and another being conducted on patients with a more severe form of the disease.
There are currently three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C administration for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin.

The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is being conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
For the study, called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older were invited, who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding and non-effective contraceptive women cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants in Italy on the test.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multi-center study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium monoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribarine: Ribarine was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19 for tests in Italy and China.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect to get the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five candidates for the vaccine were tested for stage I safety.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and related research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI's vaccine development initiative  are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in the research and development stage to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security studies:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, and RNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 candidate vaccines have been announced, but little public information is available (presumably in the planning or development stages).
Stages I-II include pre-testing for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites, with more accurate and effective doses being determined at the same time.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human trials (all are still in preclinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly compressed vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients and that even in accelerated mode, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that it had created a particle similar to coronavirus, partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac a large sum of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which was opposed by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.

Other CEPI investment partners in developing COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a $275 million funding round for 96 medical countermeasures to COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced that it would allocate 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that MNA was administering subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, prompting strong responses from antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that appeared 2 weeks after immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be released as a nasal spray.

In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities combined IBM's supercomputing resources with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits besides their disease-prevention properties.
Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health workers.
The vaccine may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on vaccine efficacy assessment using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and low primates, indicate the need for biosecurity-level 3 infection control measures in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicines or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medicines to treat atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine for MERS that had undergone Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and under development, two adenoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media has been spreading a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all and that a vaccine against it already exists.
Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed patents exist for the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus  is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases result in mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is viral pneumonia and polyorganism failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection had been recorded in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 people dying from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread by people coming into close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets that are released into the air when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets form when inhaled, they are usually a threat to the ground or surface, but they are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also get infected by touching the contaminated surface, then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it may spread both before symptoms appear and at later stages.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected illness and for those who care for them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People who are infected may not have symptoms or have symptoms of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling cramped in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty waking up, facial or lip bruising; if any of the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, cramping, or sore throat may be less common.
Also, there are different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some cases of the disease reported in China initially showed only a feeling of chest cramping and a pulsating heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress to pneumonia, a polyorganism failure, and eventually death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people begin to experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and according to available data, not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with the disease with an asymptomatic course is currently unknown, only being studied; while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily summary on April 1, and out of 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) had declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the saliva and the urine can have a high concentration of the virus.
When you speak loudly, you get more drops in the air than you do when you speak loudly.
A study in Singapore found that when coughing openly, drops can spread up to 15 feet (4.5 m).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it is still possible to transmit virus particles via bioaerosol, and testing air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There is also concern that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms appear, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 23 other people.
In particular, it was found that on cardboard surfaces the virus can live for one day, on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304)  for up to three days, and on 99% copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.
However, these rates vary depending on humidity and temperature.
When used properly, soap and detergents have a fairly beneficial effect on infection control: soap destroys the fat-protective layer of the virus, disabling it in this way, and is also capable of removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzaloconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus.
Five of the six patients had the highest blood virus concentration on the first test, and the sixth patient had the highest blood virus content on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronavirus.
When the virus is outside the human body, it is destroyed by household soap that opens its protective shell.
The lungs are the organ most vulnerable to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using the characteristic surface glycoprotein  shipa (peplomer).
12% of the infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan had been diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders that occur as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the functioning of this organ.
High rates of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were observed in patients in OIT with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells have been found to correlate with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6, and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also found lymphocyte infiltrates.
WHO has also published several test protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is a standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples taken with a nasal swab, but a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at two-week intervals, and their results are not immediately relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify a strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in labs around the world can independently develop tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect current infection and possible past infection were in development but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70 percent accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, giving permission for its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital indicate methods of detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Double-sided multi-sided subpleural sealing focuses of the type of mat glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteric distribution are common symptoms identified at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of a rock bridge (a slight thickening of the gap with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little information on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological investigation performed at the time of the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, congestion and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and severe hypoxia.
Infectious pneumonia: the organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS syndrome); leuko-erythroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, adhering to breathing hygiene rules, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a napkin for coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering your mouth and nose with the inner side of your elbow area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a high-quality hand hygiene procedure.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that weave face masks be used in public places, in particular to limit transmission of infection by people with an asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed, movement of citizens has been restricted, and large public events have been cancelled.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs that have been proven effective against COVID-19. As the vaccine is expected to be completed no earlier than 2021, most of the measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the plateau outbreak.
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating and after you have diarrhea, cough or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer containing an alcohol (alcohol content  60%) but only when soap and water are unavailable. WHO provides two local-produced prescriptions for regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone suspected of being infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen your immune system, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet.
Supporting therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource  IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medications, some healthcare professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve airborne discharge, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
Medical workers caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended to be placed in an airborne isolation (AIIR)  in addition to standard contact and air precautions.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial conditions, but the FDA has approved the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used outside the instructions, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are unavailable, the CDC recommends using protective face masks or, at the very least, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence to the effect that intubation can be avoided by using a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective for critically ill patients as HIV.
Some doctors choose to use invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal canyons with intense airflow.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and healthcare systems are too limited to handle the rapid increase in cases of severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in rehab.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is becoming more difficult as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing in COVID-19 and oxygenation are increasingly causing problems.
Inhalation pressure-supported IVAs and PDCVs are needed to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage, which can lead to pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PDCV may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers participate in testing for the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the use of recombinant plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is threatened by a serious or imminent threat.
It has not been used in clinical trials, which should be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and ID number to enter.
The app can detect close contact using the observation data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation but also notifies local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence  such tools are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to track the mobile phone data of people who are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that mobile network operators report that 40% of people still continue to move around the country.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, which attracted more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersty Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are the perfect conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with minor or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Patients with mild forms of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of contracting severe forms of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are lacking.
People with the most severe course of COVID-19 can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorganism failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and problems with the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Thrombosis abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal impairment was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 2030% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women was  1.7%.
Histopatological studies of lung samples after death indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyx exudates in both lungs.
The pneumocytes have been shown to have viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 percent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Death rates vary by state because of such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Failure to count cases in a lightweight manner can lead to higher mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers who had severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more likely to develop, and these patients had about 2.4 times more frequent intensive care or deaths than non-smokers.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics found that some patients recovering from the disease had a 20 to 30% decrease in lung volume, and their scans showed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to the syndrome of After intensive therapy.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovered from the virus developed a stable immune response.
Other coronavirus cases suggest this is likely, but there were also reports of coronavirus tests still positive after recovery from COVID-19.
It is believed that the cases were aggravated over a prolonged period of time, not a repeat infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-based and an infectious disease.
The exact origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is  December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of disease, and are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the disease an ICB-10 emergency aid code: U07.1  for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2  for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 infection without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global death rate and infection rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from the disease, and the infection-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the performance of a particular population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies can tell how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebration among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the donors' blood counts.
COVID-19  official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The most at risk group  are men over 50 years of age; the gap in men's and women's performance decreases only after age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but they may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender immunological differences, less prevalence of smoking among women, male-related diseases (e.g., hypertension in men at a younger age than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and HIV have different gender statistics.
Most healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are therefore more likely to get infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease  COVID-19.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gebreissus explains: CO means corona, VI virus, D  disease, and 19  years old when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species, or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines to prevent stigma.
In public communications, WHO uses the terms COVID-19 and virus responsible for COVID-19.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly called the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and uhank coronavirus.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographic locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended using the terms acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as the temporary names of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names  COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Because of the limited volume of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials such as nasal swabs, as well as parts of IVF machines.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in time, so one of the local manufacturers was re-profiled and could print the necessary 100 valves a night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet has been rapidly spreading various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the study did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine or medication for the virus.
Currently, various international studies on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial program, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous research on SARS-CoV are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are working on a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inert or deadly, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying an S-spine-like protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy  is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA-vaccine, a new method of vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
The drugs approved for malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chlorophyll.
The reprofiling of antiviral drugs makes up the bulk of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivir, chlorohynx and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the United States, China, and Italy, and the use of chlorine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert assessment of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling that dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chlorine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese guidance in the 7th edition also lists interferon, ribavirin, or umfenovir as an anti-COVID-19 agent.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for in vivo detailed study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that it is necessary to match the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) chip protein to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chlorine and hydroxychloroquine use with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
Hypercytoquinemia may occur as a complication of the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytoquinemia properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China found that tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug was released for the second stage of a nationally-run randomized trial in Italy after positive results were obtained for use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a blood serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine-release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently being considered a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have been inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus  is the expected effect that passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in the development stage.
The use of a reconvalescent blood serum, which is made up of liquid blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronavirus, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Li Wenlian, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
