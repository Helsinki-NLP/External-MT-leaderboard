Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat election fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, dismisses the latter as a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have documented only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
With this in mind, most US governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has intensified after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time for early voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day and deprive citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
For the past two years, they've sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
It's more than that.
Students, voters who are considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
However, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more Republican to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
But it turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states to reduce early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 percent of early voters were African-American, while the latter represented only 13 percent of voters in the state.
The same was true of Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that were passed and see them as a clear goal to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate Cancer Screening - Should You Take the Test or Not?
The APS test may give false negative or false positive results, which may result in unnecessary medical intervention.
Which makes men who are already reluctant to get tested even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
In the studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it's difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another European study found a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you have a 30 to 40 percent higher chance of metastasis if you don't get screened.
So I recommend testing at age 50, or at age 40 if you have a direct relative who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you've been diagnosed with cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and there are lazy cancers.
We really need to make the patient understand the risk of their cancer, offering them the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that don't affect their long-term life, and instead opting for active disease surveillance in those cases.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
We're going to suggest that they be monitored and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being set out in detail.
So I recommend you take the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should have it or not.
Movember has worked with the International Urological Society to create a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, good habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate right and exercised enough, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many of them remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make smoking a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a huge health hazard for people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: Ten years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Obesity and overweight also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer", it adds.
Food
The agency also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
So are butcher shops, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage cells in the body and lead to cancer", it says.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at present.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the SCC.
While one study found a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another reported an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not well established.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give you cancer".
The Higgs boson has been stripped clean
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
This boson is thought to be involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, that's all.
And then, it's the last particle that the Standard Model predicts exists -- our best, or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that has yet to be observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not yet completely certain that it's the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we're holding a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let's just assume that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is a law in this world that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way you can break that rule - and don't try too hard, you'll get hurt.
But even though particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure website of Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, which we won't discuss here, and "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson is thought to be somehow related.
These bosons, I must point out here, are not all as exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is because of an extraordinarily mundane boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interference" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that it's another field, the Higgs field, that has to be "disrupted" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, kind of like a frozen pond that only a very large rock could scratch the surface of.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometer ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't -- a piece of paper, for example, will never stick by itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, yours) don't.
Now, what can all this research "bring" to the table, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and the predictions of the MS.
Many are eager to find one, for the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and fill in some holes in the Model.
It must be said that it still has huge flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (oops!).
But we haven't found any such discrepancies at CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr and Mrs All-World is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it will not.
Here's the thing: In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work was going to spark.
They saw some scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we've already heard from the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - that the laser was originally seen as a "laboratory gadget".
Can you imagine?
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle invented a small light sensor in 1969 while working on optics.
This sensor, though not at all his original intention, now serves as the "eye" for all the world's digital cameras, and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities at the LHC are necessarily going to transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Commission dying with dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a draft law is being prepared.
But much remains to be done in this vital area.
Duty tried to look into it.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
He had been suffering from prostate cancer for two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I did seven", he said, half fig, half grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that", he says.
The disease is doing its job. It's a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone, even eating alone.
Sitting down to a delicious lunch, he resigned himself to being served.
He's brave, he can even smile, talk to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"We learn in our lives that a man urinates standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
For some people, going back to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he says.
Because many palliative care practitioners feel that great moments are occurring at the very heart of this decline.
The patients who come to Victor-Gadbois hospice are all cancer patients.
They have a life expectancy of three months at most.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For 89-year-old A., the worst fear is that she will die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease has brought me to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life", she said, before agreeing to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide care and food.
It's palliative care, which is when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's not much when you know we're all gonna die.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it be in terms of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
The dying person will be offered brandy or Pepsi mouthwash, as required.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it's his son who's gonna finish the beer at the dead man's feet.
"You help the family as much as you help the patient", says Nathalie Savard, a director of nursing.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, days follow one another but they are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the courtyard, resting on his pillows as a toast is poured out in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"In the last six months, there are still three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems in access to palliative care
It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care - care designed to ease the pain of a terminally ill patient, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this serious lack of health care in Quebec that has caused several palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by top officials in palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
She says that recently I saw a patient spend 14 days in the ER in excruciating pain, with no relief.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they're not getting proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are working hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's chances of survival were already slim when she stopped a grueling course of chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she said that she regretted that I stopped fighting.
But she told me I was finished!
Not Almighty Healing
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers for not granting their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, 8 percent of patients are unwilling to take pain medication.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is the practice of putting the patient to sleep until death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't hear that part of the pain anymore.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the option of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not cured always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanise me", it means "I want relief".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us every day what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
This "industry" has cost the Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system has been falling apart since we took the big steps", quipped Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec City MP and former Montreal police chief.
He was responsible for the scandal that broke out in 2011 through a thorough investigation into malpractices related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to backtrack.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, covert party financing and corruption of public officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone is said to have saved a billion dollars on contracts", he points out, with some holding back their instincts to get a cut!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping it will succeed in "demonstrating the schemes behind individuals".
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police from the "Hammer Squad" who, since 2009, have led the "sewage cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of raids and brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The charges against the Montreal road engineers and Italian-born contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are also formal.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of contracts he won in Montreal to a mafia-linked middleman who then funneled the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito was a big player in the 2000s, donating more than C$88,000 to provincial parties, mostly the then-ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
He was overcharging for sewage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was running smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained to the committee that in ten years he had received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes totaling $736,000 from construction companies in exchange for sewage contracts that he inflated in cost.
Other highway officials admitted to getting their money's worth by inflating bills by 30 to 40 percent, using fake extras.
Then an organizer for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget that fed his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she has been protesting since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and sold ... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says it "pulls a thread to understand the ant-infiltrated system to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montreal-based investigation unit and a day before, so we don't see any recurrence of the questionable practices.
Like cleaning up.
I'm going to be regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" when they were not involved in the scam!
Estimating that 70% of the money used in Quebec's election campaign was dirty, he quipped: "I was told that this was just a poor reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100 but this will not change the situation, he says: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken it to a new level with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players came in.
I'm making progress with them every day.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these things push me to raise my game level.
And in a game, it's easier.
Things move very quickly in football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my first days at the INF Clairefontaine Pre-Training Centre to my move to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by stages.
So you're taking advantage of the competition that Carlo Ancelotti has installed...
The recruits this summer are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and deliver the best.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti has been a great asset to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
- Of course you are.
Ancelotti is a respected man among all the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and won a lot of titles with fancy clubs.
He's been around some great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first game of the season for PSG ?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the lead.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the last eight with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
Anything can happen from now on.
But we'll have a say in the matter against some of the best teams in Europe.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to host in the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget.
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and be in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
The PSG is providing itself with the financial means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, if we don't win the title like last season, would that be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win the championship.
Last season, we didn't get very far.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you're supposed to be the champion...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It's only natural that we should expect a lot from ourselves, given the investment and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then when we win 4-0 at home to Troyes and we still find fault with each other, it's a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people want.
We can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game plan.
A team builds over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can respond in person.
Look at Manchester City, who have not been able to qualify for the last two seasons, they have also spent a lot of money!
We were expecting you to be 15 points ahead of the truce.
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have finally won.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We better say there's a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is very good and scoring a lot of goals.
He came here to prove he's the star of Ligue 1.
He's proven everywhere he's gone that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It makes others want to play higher.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's a disappointment.
I wanted to play in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury kept me from playing.
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Now I can play good games for the national team.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months at the helm of the Blues ?
He's got the results for himself.
We're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Does the draw on 16 October in Spain constitute a qualifying match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone else.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is the opposite of current monetary exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded on the network's 15,000 computers.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinct from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both ledger keepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the same way as an e-mail.
Except a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins actually exist in the public ledger, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write down this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will be privileged to add this extra line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter, unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "chopping" the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once the number is found, the other nodes can easily check that it is the correct one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided in half regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they're divisible by a hundred millionth, which leaves room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
The network's life has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were hacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The flaw is not in the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Powerful players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80 percent of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, "giant payments" were made.
"Thirty thousand dollars was exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the home of the merchant, who does not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is provide an address that a phone can "take a picture and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if the currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have withdrawn from their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, not expect anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants who we have punished as terrorists.
And us, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who are refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be as the West becomes more discreet.
The French troops' departure from Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the almond-tree hills with French loans, was orderly.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul unattacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country burning and bloodshed due to fighting between different factions.
Their taking over the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved in recent times.
Former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining forces in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it for building land to refugees who had come back from Iran and Pakistan, getting huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They have become disrespectful of themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, long for a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the American bounty: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They've been exposed to the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they've enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls and boys.
We must provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, is addicted to cell phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is watched everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with re-establishing provincial militias, which will escape the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralisation, like Western nations, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before that.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in working order, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also be necessary someday for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to return to normal relations.
The French fighting troops were completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls and boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" department of the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), which was abolished in 2012, has carried out, and had a small French NGO carry out, many community-based works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These labour-intensive works helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave as a souvenir after spending two billion euros on the military?
A much smaller budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of over 2,000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
If they are to be free from the insurgency of foreign groups, as the farmers have told me they want, they should be given a small, well controlled civilian aid that directly affects them.
A Constitution in the grip of Egypt
This is another poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
As Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he has decided to play it cool.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago the head of state gave the Assembly two months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal problems.
This new initiative has only increased the division in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample the law".
The supporters of the resolution claim that this is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time that forced the Brethren to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems confident that Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
This is especially true since this use of a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep the full powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, overwhelmingly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the declaration of the constitution, they had slammed the door, feeling they had not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles were voted on most of the time unanimously.
Some commentators have even laughed at the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, with some committee members feeling that the constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Despite all the attention, Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the liberals reply, seeing it as a mere communication trick.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It is the first sign of a theocracy".
The Liberal fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university will be far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of them trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity about Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
It refers to fiqh in particular.
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it".
The text voted yesterday is being heavily criticized for its religious aspect and for the extensive powers it gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are much smaller than they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights groups have demanded.
The Commission has also expressed its concern about the text, which it considers to be a liberty-killing measure.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly the press.
Moreover, no article is more about protecting women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, was the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land is a combination of the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comforts, and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has selected five main reasons for you to go to Israel.
Go worship in the holy places
They meet at the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptism wells" will be touched by divine grace.
Galilee is the land of Jesus' miracles - where he turned water into wine, where he walked on water, where he calmed a storm, and where he miraculously caught fish.
It was there that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the place where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The faithful walk the Street of Sorrows or the Way of the Cross (Latin: la Via Dolorosa).
The road starts near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the Stone of Anointing and Burial.
Here is the Christian center of the world, the symbol of salvation for mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is built on the spot where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for the Jews - the Western Wall, the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions leave small words and prayers on the altar that are then answered.
Travel in the High Country
Visit the ruins of the fortress of Massada, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only climbers can go there on their own.
For others, a cable car takes them to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of between 1,600 and 2,040 m, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which is a popular winter destination for tourists.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs say that pagan gods once dwelt on the mountain's top.
Visiting the most unique museums
This country is home to almost 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit all of them in one trip.
Here are five of the most interesting ones that are really worth checking out.
First, the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very old Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, you can visit the Hammam Al-Basha with its Turkish baths made up of castings of visitors and watchmen of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guidebooks or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Memorial Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, which looks back on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in and you go into total darkness.
The stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts in Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, since the water temperature does not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C], while the air temperature can reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim in it all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world. It is the lowest point on Earth, at 1,300 feet [417 m] below sea level.
The blue water contains brine and is very easily trapped by bathing, even by those who cannot swim.
The landscapes around it are surreal in their beauty.
People come to the area to get treated with salt water, silt, and medicinal sludge, to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and simply to relax.
Unlock the Secrets of the Ancient World
They are kept by the ancient city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life right here.
Tourists especially enjoy strolling along narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls of the street that match your sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take pictures from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "conquering" the crusader fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For travel, it is best to use dollars instead of euros, since they are easily exchanged for shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost like an underground funicular.
The fare for all public transport is 6 shekels and you can change for 1:30 hours.
In Israel, Jewish tradition requires that the Sabbath be observed on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation are closed.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales, and both milk and meat dishes.
There are a variety of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, various sauces, ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk around with a proud face.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These felines love to be out in the country and they don't mind being treated.
Renting a car varies by brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance is $15 a day.
Renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
The average entrance to the museum is 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
Most of these were travelers and vacationers from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate the law on compulsory language testing, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the victims are from Central Asia - Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families back home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force that states that every migrant worker must pass a Russian language exam.
At present, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, in time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, Russian history and legal foundations will be validated.
You will need to validate your knowledge of Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian is the official language are exempt.
The law also does not apply to persons who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
The initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders had already asked the question in the press many times: what will it do?
What will the requirement to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the immigration officials say, it will reduce the number of people who suffer "from work slavery".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organised selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future migrant is bound to encounter dishonest people who, under the guise of helping him, will provide him with a "trip" to a crowded house where he and dozens of his peers will be tormented for months without food and paper and must toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken away, and they do not get the expected salary", says Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for Work of the Tajik Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come to Russia to earn money say that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to visit but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajik can afford even a decent primary education.
Their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone clothe them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach their teens, they start earning money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and worthless".
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be for only legal immigrants.
Without a statute, there will be no examination or official work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or not"
Many immigrants say that it is not so easy to obtain a legal status in Russia.
The reason is administrative barriers and still language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money - between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know we have fake papers, we have no registration, hence the extortion cases.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea", said Uumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik citizen.
"Hurry up, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
From the first day of the language law, it was discovered that the immigrant registration papers were not the only ones to be forged.
Several fake language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The counterfeit papers are from a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not disappointed. Each migrant who hoped to make the exams easier had to pay seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Officials and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities may give migrant workers who failed to pass the exam at the first attempt time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs in fields that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not in charge of the arms market.
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is proposing tougher laws against civilian weapons.
This is how authorities have reacted to recent incidents, from the shooting at weddings to the murder of seven people by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age to obtain a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the State Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "screwing up".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various firing centers, demand that "this senseless hardening" be abandoned.
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime expert for the BBC, told the Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, in a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a registered firearm in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening the laws on civilian weapons will not stop criminals from sourcing their weapons on the black market.
They say that today in Moscow you can buy any weapon at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims to control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Headquarters.
Screenshot from a website that takes orders for weapons
The first is the "military trail", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians", Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stores and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal guns are going on sale from the military warehouses.
Many of these have been hit by explosions.
"Some of the fires were deliberately set to cover up the shortfall", says the former soldier.
Baranets thinks the weapons manufacturers are behind it.
"There are private arms factories that are not competing on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow", says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organises the supply", adds the former soldier.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts estimated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market ended up there "because of the lack of employees whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to the researchers, 17 percent of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14 percent are stolen during manufacture, and 5 percent come from "clandestine searches".
A salesman and consultant at a gun shop who asked not to be named said that for a long time no one had bought the weapons found by the clandestine excavation specialists; they were too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers go to the military warehouses to pick up the new goods.
The person buys a unit, for example a TT pistol, through a sign.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a barrier.
"He takes it into town and sells it for £900 a unit with two chargers", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers", adds the seller.
"Like in a fancy shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was supposed to take me to a corner to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
"To buy a gun", the salesman says, "I need to know someone who has a contact.
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to go there and say, for example, "From this person, who asked me to tell you that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The new kids look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Victor Baranets tried his hand at buying illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he says, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album with "anything we want" in it.
"I thought I was in a high-end store", recalls the soldier.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, everything can be tried.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller into the woods and set up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm sure the gun works, we start negotiating", he says.
A shop from her couch
Search engines show the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
You don't need any papers or anyone to meet.
"Just have a certain amount of money", says an advertisement on the website "Buy a pistol or a machine gun".
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
And sell to the miners?
"Without a permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has a huge network of fake websites and is picking up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People are rushing for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, former military observer
I have heard about this type of scheme: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking over.
The buyer makes the payment at the automated terminals.
"He gets a picture and instructions on where to hide the gun", explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to Bear Arms Association.
Victor Baranets says that by applying to the site, you can end up without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has a huge network of fake websites and is picking up people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People are rushing for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia", he says.
A Makarov for a hundred bucks .
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Gun Association, a Makarov pistol can be bought for $100 to $300.
It'll take about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes decreased in Russia by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8 percent.
United States: Fast food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers work as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has erupted over the low wages at Walmart supermarkets and popular fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow stronger or fade away quickly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases for the base workers at Walmart and fast food chains, the protest organizers want unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a downpour of sales that swept millions of Americans and sometimes sparked outrage.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize picket lines with unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores, whose products are aimed at low- and middle-class consumers.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The average price of products is 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain of harsh working conditions, such as the lack of elevators or portable scanners.
The Black Friday protesters demanded a pay rise, complaining that the price of the company's health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the average Walmart worker who makes $9.5 an hour, that's a lot of money to pay.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than he's spending right now.
If Walmart were to shift all the pay rise onto the shoulders of consumers, every run in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They'll spend just $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
Black Friday continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second during that period.
His funds have made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just one "com' operation among many" by the organizing union.
"Next one up!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, so they are not yet there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's advertises selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food companies are increasing their prices over time, but soon, on average, its basic employees in New York make $8.90 an hour.
No one in this town is less touching than they are.
I can't imagine living with that kind of money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there long.
Now I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes have to feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters who started the movement at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue were demanding that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing or punishing union protesters by bullying or firing.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food is still a difficult task, and for good reason.
One of the main reasons is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They disagree.
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with several local Democratic politicians including City Councilman Jumaane Williams who said: "McDonald's announces billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for your honest work!"
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food workers so they get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described the event as the largest demonstration in the history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is difficult to say at the moment whether this spark of mass movement will produce little ones.
"At the moment, we can only fool the brain moderately"
Recently, fans of new technology have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, an interview with Shahram Izadi, director of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, shows that for Microsoft scientists, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us briefly what your research group does?
- We are working on human-machine interaction and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has been left for the moment with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and predict the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although the Kinect has made the interaction physical, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has been improved (the system receives more data), but the output, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to take the computer world out into our own, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
This, however, requires identification not only of the user but also of the space around him.
So we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical way.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid VR headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command ?
It's appreciated, but isn't it overrated?
This is not a panacea. The issue of privacy arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of computer interaction is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera on the camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean, "no"?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this can?
You would do it with your words and your gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
For example, these can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you dislike about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we are basing our work on in 3D recognition.
Obviously, it would be nice to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 cps.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind in the X and Y axes, but also in the Z axis.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond lab has given touch sensors a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I could use a camera like this in my work, but without the need to touch, so I can get more frames per second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a standard visible-field sensor.
It's not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the volume of computation required.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not introduce its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the perspective of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone all the time with your hands up is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "temporary" augmented reality that would allow you to switch from a cloud platform to a smartphone from glasses.
Glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them so powerful (personal items are the ones that only you can see) and at the same time their weakness: Augmented reality from glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is now only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: There is no touch sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting techniques is using the second hand as a picture carrier.
It's a perfect record of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to make these "images in the air" palpable: for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still faint, of a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a focus of work that presents prospects.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he's feeling what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below that we will have to struggle with for a long time to come: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing like those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
So far, we've only managed to fool the brain to a moderate degree, and there's still many years of work to do.
This is what makes virtual reality work so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute fertilisation stage.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the project "The St. Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city's citizens who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This highly selective list has already welcomed prominent artists from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and have gained recognition in Europe, having become known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a rather bearded man dressed in red, who can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and at fashionable parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds, no matter where they are exhibited.
He was one of the mainly social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and cheer.
He recently took up a Barbary organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg, having matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, philosophy and image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you driving around the city in red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer who specializes in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even in society, anything that isn't gray is likely to cause aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you wanted to be a painter?
- At the exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my work was.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina that gave birth to "Pushinskiy-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theater, fashion, music, every genre except words.
It was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took up a position in Pushkinskaya 10, which before the construction was home to a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in a playback in tight jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a popular composer today.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his basic training and education, he received it at home.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero from the last century, from a time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a press poll was held and the prize was "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that was the end of my reign.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a cultured person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong timeliness and sharpness.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
I used to be a social person, but now it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragedy falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it's the outfit that matters, the outer mechanism that matters, not the inside of the person.
Maybe we can't shake hands, but we should spit on his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
We saw you recently playing the organist of Barbary.
Who else but me can play it?
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquor.
A disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemians liked one thing, non-bohemians liked another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to please.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we've thrown out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and in the end it's less management, less money, everything worn out.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was younger, I used to paint paint pictures that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings, which are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, people often get confused.
They say there is a spiritual culture, a consumer culture.
Consumption has nothing to do with culture.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm all for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- They're good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand the culture well, but they understood that you had to keep the good experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're being pushed aside, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Today, the "reign of taste" is in full swing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must be found other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
This is a very thin layer in my house.
We must make art fashionable again as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with Earthlings on board set off in search of a planet of rescue.
To save humanity, a big question arises: How do we keep our species alive in zero gravity or on a backup planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that we can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
"These are Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
While Mars has more favorable conditions for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 degrees.
We can only live there at very high altitudes or in orbit around Venus... in space.
We started to get interested in questions of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Only half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the varieties on Earth.
Then we put insects into orbit, small breeding Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
You get a perfectly normal chick out of it.
That's when the problems start.
"The problem is that the chick needs to find support, get on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
The chicks were unable to find any support and were moving about in a disorderly fashion.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely paralyzed.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
Sadly, they would simply die after four days.
"We took their eyes out twice and then we gave up because it's just impossible to work with them there", explains Vladimir Sychev after seeing the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, we haven't discovered anything supernatural.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to reproduce directly in space.
It's not an easy thing to do.
When animals lose their natural environment, they are no longer able to fulfill their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not done for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is the most precious thing that humanity has.
Our seagull flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have had a child after the robbery.
"No one answered that question", says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space engineer.
In June 1964, just one year after her first flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in outer space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have very few, if any, cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, they are dangerous even during orbital flights", concludes pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet and Russian Hero Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet mankind must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Centre: compulsory step in flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts are training for extravehicular sorties.
Water is imitating gravity.
For adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The little amphibians seem to confirm this: life on Earth originated in the ocean.
Since the baby develops in the lymph fluid of the mother's womb for about nine months, it is easier for him to get used to water later.
This is logical, since from birth to first bath, only two weeks pass.
"It's a small price to pay", says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, while weightlessness is more natural for a newborn child, the woman needs gravity, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will be able to get him out.
"What then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov, inviting us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the earth's pull, the body cannot form skeleton or muscles.
You can't dress a baby like an adult in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his basic needs.
"And this experiment, which we would consider in this case, by imagining a child being born in a foreign environment, will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unadapted", predicts Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality when Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet to become the home of their spaceship-born offspring.
The head of the SFI (Supreme Audit Institution for Public Finance) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech "Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has competent public procurement inspectors and quality legislation but lagged behind in its enforcement.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Authority for Public Finance Control in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and in my opinion that is what is missing from us", Kala said in his comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of Petr Nečas' "Švarc system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs would not burden contractors with controls; is that allowed or forbidden?
"The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot stop an authority that is supposed to go and inspect to enforce the law", Kala says.
At the meeting of the Committee on Audit in the Chamber of Deputies you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of the two countries were compared.
What was the specific question?
This is a parallel monitoring which we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public procurement is managed and specific national legislation and practice follow it.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure is not yet complete, we have found some very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be 'harder and of better quality', but according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote ourselves to the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you in practice and what does it mean for you?
This is the kind of common control which should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), so as to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this.
It may be that the system is so overwhelmed with paperwork that those looking for flaws will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems in the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SCI or a different way of organising it?
As regards the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similarly organised and has a slightly different board, functions there, but the two institutions operate in a basically similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, with one nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which is the state's resources here.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but it is certainly not possible to say that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
But it must also be said that this country which we regard as a model also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, and are its effects already being felt?
This amendment has been introduced relatively recently and has not yet had any impact on our control operations.
Since we do a posteriori checks, we must expect a certain delay.
Our observations are only for the moment about the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new 'risk of mismanagement' tool with which we have screened almost 14 000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt there, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law as a benefit or as an additional burden on the administration?
I think this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and impossible to follow.
Under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council in the case of regional operational programmes) already obliged the subjects to accept that any breach of the market law would mean a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not like this, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG would not bother contractors with checks on the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going in to inspect and enforce the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it", but he can't say we're going to act like nothing happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied justly and that is what I think is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen in places, but most of them are still passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow covered.
The network is however still largely viable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were clear this morning, but in places frozen and also snowed.
Temperatures have dropped to -5°C and -10°C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
The snow has stopped in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
The peaks of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to the Regional Road Maintenance Service, visibility was reduced in some places due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, caution is still needed, for example on some bridges where the pavement may be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
Some of the tracks still have ice and snow in places that are clogged with traffic.
Drivers must be especially vigilant in high-altitude areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Roads and Highways Authority reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that traffic-clogged snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous and high-lying areas.
The road maintenance services warn drivers about the risk of ice in the high altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice may occur in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the county and third category roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts, a traffic-clogged snow cover is present on the roads in the high-lying areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with possible overcast passages.
There will be a slight wind and temperatures will generally range from minus 3 to + 1 °C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are now passable, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt to the weather.
It's freezing this morning, temperatures are between minus 9 and minus 10 degrees.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost easily accessible, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The pavement of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may freeze in the South Pilsen and Tachov districts.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be alert, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now face a thick and soft snow cover on the roads.
This layer remained on the 'Červenohorské sedlo' pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field last night, and according to the road authorities, more than three centimeters of snow fell in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
"On the hills of Šumperk district there are snow remnants.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník should expect to encounter a thick and soft snow cover at the so-called Červenohorské sedlo", the head of the Šumperk district road maintenance services told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from Jeseník district also went to the site during the night, and according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easily passable, but in the Šternberk district drivers should be careful on sections in forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the road maintenance services in North Bohemia have reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered by snow and ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads.In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported so far.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for the formation of the storm - rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing at night.
There are also reports of difficult conditions on the main roads on National Road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was caused by tree branches that were bent under the weight of the snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "Together we want to collect positive energy".
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group, The Tap Tap, we're more of a laughingstock and we think we're the only group that can harness some positive energy left over to either push back or prevent the end of the world.
And in December, you're putting together a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers a more detailed presentation of this project?
This is a charity event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end virtually at the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Whose idea was that?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think with the audience about the state of the world we're leaving our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original doomsday keys, which people can also support by purchasing online at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap band with other performers also recorded an anti-doomsday anthem called "End of the World Cancelled" (Czech: Konec světa zrušeno).
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we hear her at these charity concerts too?
Of course, everything in the end, well, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The national anthems will also be joined at some point in a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show business, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We are trying to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in this kind of cooperation and they enjoy it.
What good will the profits from these concerts be against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on for the last six years in the framework of the Jedlička Institute, together with the Tap association.
Teachers regularly visit the students at Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves cannot afford to go to classes, so we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will move this project to a new independent building.
Will there be multiple bands and performers on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria did you use to choose them?
We tried to develop a programme that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May we will play for the first time in Prague Spring, and there too we will surely have a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine shows in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of disabled people.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chairs whose machines must travel in the cargo hold, and of course we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Traveling abroad allows you to compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything is working better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that the whole of the East is still in an initial phase.
Compared with Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; it is not yet common for a person there to travel alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They don't yet consider it self-evident to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, an association is being set up there too to draw attention to the problems of disabled people.
How can we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
It is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be active in society, but you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and easy access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
So far, these are just isolated cases of people with strong willpower.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, so let's go back a few years, what made you start this band in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who were willing to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play saxophone, among other things), with a colleague, we created a music business.
And then, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, over time, we lost a little bit of control of the situation. (Laughter)
The success only came in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, making friends with well-known singers and actively promoting the band helped.
We have learned that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have a goal to reach that level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But compassion is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned beings that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the means to do so.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it's not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you're a demanding leader, as many people call you?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and demand a certain degree of discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already here in 1998?
There's only one, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, there's nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to anyone who wants or would like to join us.
It will be the day before the world's end, Thursday, December 20, 2012, beginning at 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague at the Incheba Arena, in Brno at Fleda and in Ostrava at the Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, the three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the group The Tap Tap will sing together the song "End of the World Cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the European Space Agency's ministers, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the agency, the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and over the years has participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, enthusiastic Poles were working on space flights; they were not always understood.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas from his ground-breaking work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left cold listeners and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of astronautics, and his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925 a rocket-powered drainage system was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, we do not know the author or the details of this project.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was intended to propel or brake the drystein.
The only information known about this draisine is from the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The surviving documents show that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937 the plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialist press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects to use rocket technology were conducted by the temporary scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee was formed in 1937, but after two years of operation, the outbreak of war interrupted its activities.
After the war, further works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of a company was in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, which contained four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the study of space
At that time, projects for artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held the position until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket, with a range of 1,800 meters, was 80 centimeters long and weighed just under 5 kilograms.
An improved version, the RM-1A, was subsequently built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kilograms.
The next prototype should have been capable of carrying out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But by 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 23 miles.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut in this programme.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Utilities Act.
This decision has caused a heated debate in public opinion.
It is certainly worthwhile to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetual conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour (wages) prices create a price pressure.
The term is defined as a producer who, by importing cheaply sold goods, tries to resist economic competition by "raising" the price of a competitor, in order to take a larger share of the market and thereby increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, buy cheaply or disappear, resulting in high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burden on the State necessarily increases.
The whole situation intensifies the perfectly bad will of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own population at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the existing laws.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the dictates of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of longterm unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty and a widening gap between rich and poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work for years.
The number of such people is already in the millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to ensure that they reach the minimum living wage.
A similar scandal has been reported, for example, in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as happened in the 19th century) or to live on paltry wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot invest capital in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly advocates the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then is whether private capital does not influence and even govern politics and, by extension, the State as a whole, in accordance with its own selfish interests.
The answer to that question is no doubt yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, in the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms with close links to industry.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions claim, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly facing the situation described by Appian in his book "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in a state of decay and functions were given by violence.
Bribery, illegal favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The underbelly and corruption proliferated without limit and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek any office, and as a result, once the state was without consuls for eight months"... 'It was really said that the remedy for this difficult situation was autocracy and that a strong man had to be chosen"... True, Appian had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, society today is based on the preference for personal gain, with no regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and advance the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decline of the elites, with no effort to bring about any deep reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
The disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human lives being lost, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways of lowering the social standard of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is to introduce socio-political reforms, which will increase the investment of state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens over the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel is a laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will", Sting says in the song Fragile, whose main chorus line is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none", said Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some are taking Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others are supporting the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to dwell on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in its recurrent waves of killings; after all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those in the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view from behind the curtain, of the one who is mainly benefiting from the tensions that have already been going on for over 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others are based on my own understanding of the one, or more accurately the group of individuals, who are the main instigators of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all a history of a struggle for power.
In any era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone on the throne who directed their actions according to pre-defined goals.
We must recognize that we live in an age when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that gives rise to certain powers could not be achieved in one generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family stands out in particular, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't rule him out).
Little has been written about them.
Of course I did.
In the 1990s, they acquired the world's largest news agency (Reuters) to stop the association of their name with serious criminal activities in which they were involved, which had always meant for them to strengthen their power, increase their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries where they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has put the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status and during the Civil War began issuing his own money (government, I understand) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third to reduce the world's population to between 1 and 0.5 billion (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being but the beginning of such a solution), and finally to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent a recurrence of crises such as those which they caused in 1907).
After successfully starting World War I by assassinating Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic or military justification (war was no longer necessary to destroy Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, the power in Central Europe.
The bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany enormous war reparations, thus creating the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had only to place a leader who was sufficiently energetic, pointing fingers at the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which they actually held) of fifth column to ignite the fire and start a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to say whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether all he did was planned, but the fact is that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps laid the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as war reparations imposed on Germany started World War II, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first casualty of the fighting, this time along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just look at how bitterly divided people are between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one injury begets another in an endless cycle of violence and where the root of all is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
We must distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in our country, the international bankers only propose their own candidates to the people in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and lead to the destruction of the world economy.
How do we now see David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order?"
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world where every newborn is implanted with an electronic chip at birth, making them a totally controlled being.
"And it causes everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his hand or on his forehead, so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the name of the wild beast or the number of his name.
This calls for understanding. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
This number is the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When things go bad, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for decades.
The situation offered no positive outcome for the American administration, which could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was further aggravated later by the failure of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, depicts an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After some complicated adventures, they met at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
Working with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran under a daunting cover: they left the country on Canadian passports as members of a film crew to do background checks for a big-screen science fiction film.
Combination of the sexes
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan requires the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on the film project, press conferences were held, and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film being based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is partly a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The scenes follow one another: documentary-style footage from Tehran (subtitled footage shows iconic photographs from the time of the events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed into the film, there are no major differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then there were scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a derided actor, he became a respected director, and his acting stopped provoking sarcastic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film after the dark detective Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to be set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his early films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the opening sequence of the embassy fall is impressive for its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake crew shooting in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to be content with a subject that actually had few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the word.
He does very well, sometimes he adds some elements to reality and here the result is not always so elegant (the scene where the threat of a crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the chase on the runway is pretty close).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipative nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their roles as Hollywood co-stars, their characters would have deserved a bigger role and they are far from alone in this.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, but is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 1970s.
He's got the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some ways, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch a competition for the most absurd regulations or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering adopting a quota of 40 per cent women for the management of large European companies recently was the reason for our decision", said the organiser of the survey, Patrik Nacher, to the newspaper Právo.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Until now, however, women have had an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they are objectively less of a risk to insurance companies.
People can report any other equally amazing idea of the 'EU workshop' until the end of the year.
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to higher egg prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term 'spit butter' or the withdrawal from sale of conventional ampoules.
Good bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often responds under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic currently imposes its banks' demands by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of lobbyists are also behind, for example, the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an 'abnormal curve'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards which complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, who claim that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to the EU regulation of last year that inflatable balloons must bear a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US survey that showed that balloons are the leading cause of children's deaths from choking among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing fair trumpets.
We have some weird ideas here, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone with an official position within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume limits for canned mushrooms and was thus subject to a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants interesting.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have the sea makes us disabled.
We will ask the European Union for a refund". This was the view expressed in the autumn of 2004 by the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production and the so-called interventionist purchases, the State had full stocks and had to export them.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access to the sea.
The grant grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and were to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says that "weird regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticised in the Member States, many experts say that the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development are to be commended.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration but which have been imposed by Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, is fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight in which it does not always win) is very emotional for the Czechs.
If after six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', our producers had to replace the name 'Tuzemský rum' which dates back to the 19th century with the name 'Tuzemák'.
Only products made from cane sugar alcohol, and not from beet sugar, may be called rum.
The official EU list of registered products now includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck breadcrumbs or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carp ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatecký hop ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Horices" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, what's the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't stand to see the country being looted for the last 20 years, the thieves not in jail and taxes and the retirement age going up.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to make a solution to change it.
And since I am over forty and an independent, non-party member, I have no other choice but to run for president or for the Senate.
You entered the Senate but quickly made your way to the Castle.
Isn't that how you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said I'd fight for the castle based on the Senate election results.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, it's just a tool to help me realize my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not just that as a nation we're clamouring at the bar or in front of our TV sets, but that we're trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
Add to this the media's defamatory reporting and confusing freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been alleged that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have started the fight for the castle with the themes of political and criminal liability and retroactive tax returns of more than twenty million [CZK] as your battleground.
You must change the law to that end.
As president, you do not have that power and only the full Senate can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen pushed for tourist guiding to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is the political stuff: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, member of no party, I have a much better chance of getting the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it doesn't really matter.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are on the left or the right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone calls you a populist?
But what you said proves that.
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have some optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been implemented by the world and talked about by renowned experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you're left with slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go out and talk to people, you will be successful, for example, in imposing property and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
I have to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public and try to rally them to my side to impose it.
If I were elected President, I would have no problem broadcasting live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then perhaps explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who identifies abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, which was achieved thanks to public pressure.
I confess, without ambiguity, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I have just entered politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to get things done on my own, and if it doesn't work, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person alone cannot make a difference, which is why I went to a number of people and asked them to stand for the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the oil fraud.
I ran because people are really upset, but now I'm hesitant.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and those who did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have elected a Senate that will be unlikely to force change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you thinking of starting your own party ?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check the history of every potential member for stainless steel and I don't have the financial means to do so.
I also don't have any money for my presidential campaign, I only have 20 grand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
Speaking of tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate my personal property to be worth about $60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a childhood dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was gay with women and fought evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth $60 million and you don't have any campaign money?
You want to change the Republic but you don 't want to invest your own money ?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million dollars for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put two and a half million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme is not attracting much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are largely covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying for my son's English school which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for office.
So you're going to continue your business activities to make a living?
Didn't you say you were going to silence your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I've partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will be running the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a good Samaritan to save the Republic.
I must have something to live on.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I was making and I'm still making between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd stop my business activities.
You can find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects at MVRDV prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination.
"I think it's funny, it looks very futuristic, it's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, says: "Yes, this building is indeed beautiful".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everybody has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of those dingy libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town with nothing attractive on the outskirts of Rotterdam, has a rather unusual record.
The municipality of 80,000 has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To restore some of the brain's neurons, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture by reproducing the seven fictional bridges on the euro notes in the form of pretty little miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive was limited.
The city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics - to build a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold stick drawings and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the judges were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging, Maas, brazenly, piled his favorite books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech backed by activist arguments with one: "Dear Common!"
Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the $30 million mountain has risen from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few townhouses and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project was also selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dreary little town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of astonishing ugliness, with white façades that suggest a dairy farm, has become a modern architectural masterpiece.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to Reading
First printing: Eldorado from the book under the cheese bell.
Although an elevator takes you to the heart of the mountain, the real joys of reading and architecture are revealed when you step on the floor of the building and discover its topography.
The interior, made entirely of glass, is bright and clear, the floor made of Dutch brick and the elegant streetlights speak unmistakably the language of the city's public squares.
The city atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And books everywhere, books and books.
"Normally, the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal", explains Willy Maas.
We completely upended the traditional spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been cleverly laid out: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rails of the library, which are sometimes panels, sometimes balustrades, sometimes ramps of stairs.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of hardened buildings don't want unfamiliar materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
So one day we found an ad hoc agricultural waste in a Friesian farmhouse.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane of one millimeter thickness has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves us time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time, in such quantities into four-centimeter-thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, Landbouwplastic (KPL) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous and durable material, which smells like a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the mountain's summit.
Nearly 500 meters up, the literary café offers a spectacular view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
These create an atmosphere, but they are most important in maintaining the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but with all the glass, this building is a model ecological project", says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun shines only briefly inside, even on good days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as a sunshade, blocking much of the sun's rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds will take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computer scientist mentioned earlier, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his or her personal library.
This helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully filled - it now has 70,000 books.
The concept is a success.
The rays are pouring in everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library".
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration".
This is how MVRDV has achieved the core discipline known in professional jargon as 'identity building'.
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
It is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role".
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, the decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy defined by the Americans and to introduce a German foreign policy.
The lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans were thus facing several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still groping for that role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What does the term 'normal' foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows a willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from those of the other great powers.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany has important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
I would not, however, attach too much importance to this, because it is not a purely one-sided relationship.
But this is at any rate a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by abstaining in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
I therefore believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic American political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political situation in the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from over enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Does Germany have any difficulty in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States with the position of its major European partners?
I don't think that makes it any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
That is what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a driving role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a delicate question.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role which will make them more independent.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international scene, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have trouble taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still uncomfortable with it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still having difficulty playing a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, there are many anti-German sentiments.
It doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with neighbors and with very different opinions, and that is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling the void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and they're just less appreciated, that's life!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a registered trademark in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing the trade mark cannot bring a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not certain she'd win.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in infringement of Far Eastern property rights.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
The copycats only need a few more letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we're going to register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we're going to register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being legally copied, such as sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file containing the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell almost all counterfeit goods.
However, Pattloch's case is different: his clients instruct him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It's a term used to describe women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this", Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the uniqueness is lost, the reputational damage is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially for the expensive flagship products.
According to data from market research firm CLSA, China is the world's third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the register of trade marks and such procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the trials in which the court rejected the complaint because after a long time the name under criticism had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, had previously used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the eye of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing, however, admits that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office is said to have gone from a "working emergency to a normal situation" last year.
The number of unresolved opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, a 75% increase from the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending at the office.
The cost of action
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth time in a row at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each recording earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or $160.
A legal battle costs far more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
It is true that the Germans have been able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It is our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany", explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Office of the Trade Mark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Municipalities.
Freudenberg won the next two cases, but the other side continues to fight to this day.
The Need for Vigilance
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The process is long, exhausting, and costs us a lot of time and money".
The internal costs are also difficult to assess, and the Archives Department has even had to review records from the last 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "large six-figure euro sum" to settle the dispute, but to no avail.
"That's how you see what it means to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from that region were to exploit the unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register the Freudenberg name in Germany for a footwear and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned this business, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is needed".
He and Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in their trade relations with China.
They argue that it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but that foreigners should "register in China too anything that can be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Clap, sing and help
The Imbongi Choir rehearses in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland are happy to see them.
Here is the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 5,800 miles.
First, you kick the floor with your foot, and cowboy boots, sneakers, women's slippers, and men's moccasins all try to find the rhythm by hitting the floor with their foot.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly increase - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - and they rage, enchant, and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi Choir rehearses a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers ranging in age from 23 to 69 came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the homemaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorus has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
23.5 million of these live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "praise-singer" in Zulu.
No one in this area can speak the Bantu language fluently, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany and now returns to her home region of Southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies Esitjeni, a village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest huts of straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents.
Esitjeni is a smaller scale of the ills that plague Swaziland - the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
Over 40 percent of the population of Swaziland is infected with the virus, and it is not uncommon for people in their mid-30s to die.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, where the Imbongis saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care but also everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged a few euros a year to send a child to school and to provide a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, an organization that has since been providing almost professional care for the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubes and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Which groups are most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by male-to-male sexual contact.
In heterosexual adults, infections associated with chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), blennorrhea and the human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The HIV transmission rate among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, but about 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
The rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher among young people than among other groups of the population.
According to European statistics, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, the human papilloma virus is common among young people in Germany.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared with the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not usually cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't protect 100 percent.
This is because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sex partners have regular checkups.
Most STIs that are detected early can be cured and delayed effects can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds that the choristers raise through their voices throughout Germany, the funds are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about EUR 200,000 to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also made sure that the orphans had a good home, perhaps with one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of these homes provide shelter for up to 14 orphans and ensure that they arrive at school on time and in uniform each day.
The orphan, who has no one left, is taken to a safe place, to Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school and two chicken coop facilities, and with the help of the American Health Organization (PSI), the association has organized an HIV test for many of the local people.
This is not to be taken for granted, for although the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"AIDS is a taboo subject", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a sexual subject".
That's pretty weird, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, was known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms are found on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh".
To promote some cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir members travel together every two or three years to Southern Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many in the black tip of the continent still know from the days of apartheid.
The bus full of white people singing in African languages is a sign of such gratitude that it not only brings good cheer and joy but sometimes even brings tears to the eyes of some fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their stepchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light", the people there say.
And after a five-mile bird's-eye view of Heidelberg, back to the choir clapping in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published Thursday in the journal Science explain.
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of an ice sheet in the region of the planet that is permanently in the shadows.
The blanket would be at least a foot thick and up to 65 feet [20 m] long.
The water probably came from comets or maybe asteroids that hit Mercury.
However, no one has linked the discovery of water to the hypothesis of life on the planet, explains Messenger's chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help explain how water and other elements essential to life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by our planet's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like tiny gaps through which we can look at infinity.
The image is taken with a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, including the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition of the term.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue, and the more difficult to identify pink dots are the "newborns" in the universe's birthing room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this star-forming region, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope has photographed the blazing brightness of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust are forming new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also called the "seven sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope gives more color.
In this infrared image, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, is looking directly at the viewer.
It's 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarities to a land continent have earned it the title North America.
The combination of normal photography and infrared photography allows for a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope is of the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust separate the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the first signs of a cosmic car crash in the constellation Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are rushing toward each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This picture was taken from optical and X-ray images taken by different telescopes.
It shows the circle of black holes that lies 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed this group of galaxies for NASA, named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also continually create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly-rayed galaxy, punctuated by a tiny black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe it began shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly made up of hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe - The Major Telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and larger, enabling us to see farther into the universe.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge, with a mirror alone measuring up to 40 feet [10.4 m] in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter is still about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its unique feature is its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is similar to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for signals from extraterrestrials using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 300 meters.
Anyone with a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by using the computing power of their computer.
View from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a worthy facility.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium-infrared spectrum.
A European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to be an impressive 42 meters in size and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror segments.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors, each about 30 feet [10 m] in diameter.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also planned to be built on Mauna Kea, with a mirror 30 meters in diameter.
This illustration is admirable.
However, the most important images of space we have come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in 2018 at the earliest on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror in the infrared space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope will be to find light emitted by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists think that the south pole of Mercury also contains ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data had been pointing to ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now know for sure.
Drink butter every day, and you can live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are living up to the ages of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where you're still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are living up to the ages of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where you're still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is a romantic one.
The small bus makes many turns along the road, clogging up forested hills, flowing rivers, and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talysh, a Caucasian ethnic group about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and live very long lives.
Lerik is the terminus.
The small town is cluttered with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not fit in with the picturesque mountain scenery.
European tourists are rare here, and travel from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too arduous.
It takes eight hours to cover the 200 miles [323 km] because the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to enjoy the country's legendary wealth from its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, believes Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year the world's oldest people's festival will be held here", Fatulayeva explains.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, the only museum of its kind in the world.
It shows the lives of about eight dozen Talysh people in the region who are over 100 years old.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120.
Having Another Child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who is believed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973", Fatulayeva said.
The man was said to have been married three times and to have had 23 children.
Could Şirali Müslümov have been wrong by a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the old man from Central Asia.
"There are also people who are surprisingly old in parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz. "In Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old".
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof because of the absence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the Lerik area often live to the age of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tour guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
But Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a roach, beating the contents of it relentlessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little children are also wandering around the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests and served in typical stomach-shaped cups.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long curls of a dark blond that her son proudly reveals.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that way it never lost its color.
"I have never used shampoo", Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what came from her own farm - tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought a single food item in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after the Second World War.
But things improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same as in euros) a month for her pension, a sum that guarantees a good standard of living in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "older people are highly respected in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "Human Rights" omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep rift in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not lacking in emotional words.
We need to make this transition a success.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he told state television.
He addressed the general public, but also especially the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the laity.
Because all the confused and hopelessly disunited members of the opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California, is trying to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the 100-member Muslim-majority constituent assembly during a 15-hour nightly police tour are indeed somewhat disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, this is suggested by a newly introduced article which states that, in all matters concerning the Sharia, the al-Azhar University must be consulted.
This may not necessarily mean that the clergy will control the legislative apparatus, which would in effect mean that the judiciary would be placed under the guardianship of the clergy.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's rule, these courts worked to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, the draft says, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In short, it would be simply censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids insulting or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording that suggests that "offending people" is forbidden.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore open to interpretation in the draft that Morsi is putting to a vote and which, in his words, will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution is coming back"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in unusual concert in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to drop Sharia law before it comes into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution is "to be thrown in the trashcan of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of trying to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for", said Khaled Ali, an Egyptian politician and opposition member, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they will not oversee the referendum, which would result in its annulment.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was being held in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and Salafists, who joined in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was] their Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud and clear.
They say now is the time to let the people decide by voting on the direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have been extended until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison and in court under Mubarak.
He did so, not because he shared their worldview, but because he considered human rights to be indivisible.
For that reason, he was beaten, tried, and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even mentioned once in the new constitution", he lamented in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expansion of powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant attacks on the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is effectively stripping it of all its powers", Saeda lamented.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It might pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control".
The Norwegian rakfisk - is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success lie in the locals' appetite for a fish with an extremely strong odor?
Have some of that cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular foods.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and that smell, pervasive, permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can be up to a year.
When it gets dark and cold, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary delicacy.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit", explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of the festival's management.
People around us are eating small pieces of fish and sipping a lot of water.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm just trying a few songs.
If you can avoid having it run under your nose, that's not bad - it reminds you of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before refrigeration was invented, fish were immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once the fish was well fermented, it was taken out and - no doubt with the alcohol-impaired senses - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - over 13 percent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, are crossing the border to come and work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though fragrant, part of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you $10 each.
Norway is not often mentioned in international news, which is not to his displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this massacre, they talk about the "incident of July 22nd".
The Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been rich in its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success", explains Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and piercing blue eyes, a symbol of Nordic prosperity, holding a plate of rakfisk.
We are - as you call us - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway kept its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and I stand in line to buy food - I've had my share of rakfisk.
On the menu, a moose burger, a real treat, that's great.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best - or perhaps the most fragrant - of them.
There's a TV show where the host wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfish plates.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fish exudate.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is off to a rough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are rampant during normal times, a security barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent the protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to the results of outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before working with the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A sprawling, densely populated state that surrounds the capital, in its favorite land, opinions are divided about this new leader.
A straight man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is inscribed in the memory of all.
The local people attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name are hanging outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman from Pena Nieto's PRI party.
We hope for real change, which our country so badly needs, especially in terms of security and economy.
After 81 years of uninterrupted rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congresswoman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected criticism from opponents who accused the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a man of integrity, very committed, with an excellent view of the country.
He's a great statesman and, above all, he's a good listener.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden beneath the highway bridges, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, where violence against women is particularly severe.
In one disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years were found near a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr Pena Nieto's critics say that at best he failed to stem the problem of murders of women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version is that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed that her body had been washed", relates Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigidity of the corpse had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dressed up on the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will come with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico in the past six years and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as he was as governor", said Olvera, a congressman in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of mistreatment Bradley Manning allegedly suffered while in custody.
The trial is about Manning being held at a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction was made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors tried to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims to have suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in custody at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion to dismiss the Manning case on the grounds that the detention was done under very harsh conditions and constituted a severe enough punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to kill himself while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers had filled out after meeting with Manning while he was held in Quantico Military Prison, where he was placed in maximum-security solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein discussed the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received inside the prison was overall "very professional".
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns orally about some of the issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and that didn't mean I didn't raise problems", Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special committee that had met to discuss suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the suicide risk closely monitored -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be stripped of my status... so that I could have a better quality of life from my perspective", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide while in Kuwait and once fainted from the heat.
He added that not being told what was coming for him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also said that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit from outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the hearing.
Manning testified that at no time was she allowed to cover herself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questioning on Friday, Manning said that he had inferred from his guardian's order that he should remove his blanket which could have concealed his nakedness, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to remove it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he was trying to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his panties or his flip flops to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experiences during his detention and significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty in a military court, a trial that is scheduled to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to lesser charges and fight to have other charges dropped that are deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, illegal posting of intelligence on the Internet, and transmission of information related to national defense.
If all charges are found to be true, he faces criminal imprisonment for life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of the hard times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked into the lobby of the customs and immigration office and felt lost.
Signs pointed to two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and one for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I sat there for a few seconds, not knowing which way to turn.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic adjective, just like my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexican-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, no special qualifications or connecting lines are needed.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I grabbed my American passport and headed to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time last week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Usually, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk their lives in the United States.
It wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto vows to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, though he didn't provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and bitter.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
So as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the Montezuma kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason there are so many Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, someone, maybe a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go up north.
And most often, this person matched a typical profile -- dark-skinned, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream right now, and we've gone to good schools and we're in good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it's the American dream that we're living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We're giving it to the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they treat us like we're inferior and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
To them, our existence is a failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they never would have left.
And we wouldn't end up stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans are more determined to claim their identity and Mexican Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
And many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they belong to one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little bit more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a wonderful country that they absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course, I'm sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And when we consider the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are so pervasive, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do this on your own, amigos.
It's not a big deal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still resent them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Quarrels, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments about who started it persist, dozens of buildings were razed to the ground; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are being caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war without losers and winners
At first glance, it may seem difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire agreed on November 21 remains in place, this week's fighting has strengthened the forces' supporters on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast that they forced the Israelis to surrender, even though Gaza was beaten.
After killing some of its leaders and pushing the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza back into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
And the Hamas leaders may think time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a rising regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken a stand for Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas members are cheering and saying that the Islamic crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia is dominating, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is cousin to Hamas, and its leaders are more likely to fall into the public's hands.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a major player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system proved effective and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their own two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier encroaching on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more war-mongering party of leader Avigdor Lieberman ahead of the January 22 election, has the good part.
Why spoil these Palestinian bastards by giving them a state?
If they were in charge of the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as their heads pop out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but perhaps the Arab Spring will change the game.
Even if the Islamists who are taking power in Egypt and elsewhere don't like Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could be the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable people on both sides, and of most of the outside world and of this paper: two states, with a cede of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, short-term, is that the ceasefire will give the outside world an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to work to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outside world should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow view.
Stability in the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
It's a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs have come into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are all over the dark green packages, which are all identical, regardless of brand.
The law, which came into force in Australia, is a world first, with the logos and colours replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of diseased organs and images of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all the packages.
This is the strictest regulation in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government said the aim was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any glamorous images.
Studies have shown that if people don't start smoking until they're 26, there's a 99 percent chance they'll never start.
"Even at a very young age, children understand the message of tobacco companies through their brand", said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess".
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying against this law.
Tobacco companies said this would boost the black market, which would make it easier to get cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be some serious consequences of this legislation", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had given them a boost in their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has risen sharply in the past two months since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's High Court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is waiting for a replacement stock.
We're doing good business.
The only drawback, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco advertising is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you're in tobacco marketing and you have a small storefront to sell your products, the Internet is the place to go", says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is just a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to make a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
The industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning pictures on packaging mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are in place in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
I don't mind the pictures.
I don't know about them.
"You take a cigarette and put it away", said Victor El Hage when he bought a pack with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna quit is because of my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's fine, we stop and put the key under the door", he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a world that's constantly connected, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I had ample time to think about the subject of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to take interesting pathways, even to nurture creativity.
And because most of us are constantly in front of different kinds of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And no, he didn't.
But I'll get back to you.
First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way", he said.
The walls of Pompeii are engraved with Latin graffiti that evokes boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there's the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting to do something but not being able to do it".
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there's no urge to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, coupled with a moody mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two may be related, bored people tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when in fact it's a problem of concentration.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the loud noise of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who listened to TV at a low volume said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed the attention deficit to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing a boring task, "like looking at objects on a assembly line, music can help you not get bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at one time or another - my flight is delayed, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boring Scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes statements such as, "Many of the tasks I do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and need a variety of stimulations.
But teenagers are usually easily bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when not at school.
By contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom rates today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom is at its highest", not least because children and teenagers have little control over what they want to do.
Let me ask you again, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to gamble or to abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers link boredom with creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do is.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored, but he won't have learned to be self-sufficient or self-regulating, says Dr. Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another", he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
I don't think we should criticize him either.
Being comfortable outside the constant bustle of activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense", he said.
He says what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get started when the noise stops".
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and other drugs - minor offenses, each with a $100 fine - and a date set for his appearance.
"We are being treated like criminals", said Mr Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than law.
Here and in Washington state, which has passed a similar measure, hundreds of marijuana-related crimes have been closed without further action.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 and older for possession of marijuana by minors, as the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute those who possess them.
Meanwhile, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to block the opening of state-licensed marijuana shops in their neighborhoods.
"Things are moving so fast that I don't know what the future holds", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulators in Washington State are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to set up a licensing system, allowing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and that's a good indicator", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves", he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis-selling businesses within a 30-kilometer radius of a school, park, playground or daycare.
"There will be no more difficult place than urban areas to establish a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older for possessing small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop charging people for this type of offense "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court rulings regulating the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get clean.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those who have committed a crime that at the time of the crime was a recognized offence", said Mr Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer charging adults with possession of restricted quantities.
County prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana possession cases without further action.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a proper legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different cities in the United States highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent a lot of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use on the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington State are fast becoming case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials plan a new frontier for legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana hope the Justice Department will back down.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and dealers, the federal government has mostly allowed businesses to sell medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that police are unlikely to break down doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a strong chance they will oppose licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado didn't wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the opening of new marijuana shops, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where someone gets a license and then we have a federal problem", said city councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and expelled from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was to me a leading center of learning, a kind of modern Greek amphitheater that fosters the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left the university because I objected to undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson jokingly said that I had left after being forced to drink from cracked cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I had been bullied and bullied constantly.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring it up today, you ask?
Well, recent studies have found that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same kind of harassment.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Room (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been made easier by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which focused on student politics and portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
One of the students was Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, wore a silver suit and carried a chrome-plated cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for the implementation of higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing bias in the universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in JCR members' attitudes toward people who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members", she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I joined in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The Conservative Party's hatred was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to award Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I got a taste of what was to come.
I found that the teachers not only shared in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on striking miners, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved on the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was subjected to was about an English translation of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily angered.
"Are Thatcherites refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - well, if you're not too busy making friends", he said in a snarky tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tories claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
That scheme failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're infected.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was a pervert, a dirty one.
"How do Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who shared my views only after dark?
Should I have become a Labour and renounced my views?
The next three years were to be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was almost never here.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he said.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his time at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said to me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the dreamy bell tower town.
Even my Communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's just to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually declined.
A friend, also named Tory, gave in to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a lead study the following week, when another history professor suggested in the most serious way in the world that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
I blushed with shame and admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and called them "old lunatics".
The respite was short-lived.
My father was the one who stuck the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's Press.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be bullied like that in a school setting.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the opening of "Valentino: a Master of Sewing", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high fashion models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the climax of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
The first room of the exhibition, which will be open until March 3, will feature an impressive collection of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from modest couturier in the northern Italian town of Voghera to international jet-set idol.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960's and 1970's, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and he's generous and elegant.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad", says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Plaza de España in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his designs are works of art", she concludes.
A parade of the noble line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes people with high manners and with the highest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous, 60-metre-wide podium where the role-changing takes place: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk on the podium to admire a dream "audience" wearing Valentino's main designs, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat once owned by Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
The items were a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", said Naty Abascal, one of the muse's muse.
"I prefer him to all the others because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty", adds the former duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a skirt with a roller, a draped bust and a falling neckline.
"It was a dream come true", said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless", says the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to Suzy Menkes, a leading authority on the trade press, the dress represents a historic event in late 20th-century high fashion, "the return of high society customers".
Blinded for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now their best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always been impressed by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance", says d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my close friends.
"He was impeccable, age has no effect on him".
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: human mules from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, volcano carriers in Indonesia risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
He has to work daily to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas from the earth's interior solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large stones of sulfur, weighing a total of about 70 kilograms, he places them in two bamboo baskets and carries them over steep paths on his shoulders.
It is only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters above sea level, but the weary porters climb this distance at a tortoise-like pace for more than 40 minutes, keeping their balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to her death from the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract.
Once on top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and with the pains of carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the two miles to the scale that a mining company has installed just below at 6,000 feet [1,850 m].
The company, PT Candi Ngrimbi, has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, in effect, its employees, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (US$5.00) per kilo of sulfur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since the mineral is a staple in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"We make about 46,000 rupees ($3,500) a trip because we carry about 70 kilograms", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes three hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees ($14,500) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem like a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.40) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees ($1.40)", says the porter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the work was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, a constant cough, and irritated eyes from the toxic gas.
At 27, he has spent three years of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already started to cost him money despite covering his face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and irritated eyes from the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
This friendly, intelligent young man, who was beset by life, could have been a tour guide, a waiter, or a receptionist at a hotel, but instead he was working as a mule.
He shares an unsanitary woodshed with other porters, rising every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps gushing out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the middle of the dark.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater illuminated by a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 porters carry the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanised the extraction of sulphur to save costs and has not provided any equipment to the freelance porters who are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a cent of the 30,000 rupees ($1.50) extra per camera, in addition to the 15,000 rupees ($1.20) entrance fee that the park's guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals, not for people", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavy porter who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years since leaving secondary school.
He can carry up to 110 kilograms, but he says he will work "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his three sons, ages 10 to 18.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind is blowing and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of serious illness - obviously added to their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, which are deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only carry 50 kilograms.
He and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano each day, which is then transported by three trucks to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, along a weed-infested goat trail.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life", Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, a 30-year-old, also works as a sulfur porter.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult professions in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on careers, stress and the cost of owning property.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem incredible that these words come from a mint-flavored ad, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polka dot in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty".
It's just for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of birth rate, so we felt that this was a topic that we needed to address.
We knew the government had tried a lot of things like throwing pheromone scents or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, what could be more creative than to turn this into a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singaporean government is not taking it lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure to support marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in line with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered as the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to counter the declining population created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are full of thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of driving down wages and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates are known to have effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are 46 square metres in size and are very popular.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular in the sense that they are built much faster than larger houses.
For that reason, it's a lot more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in a bind if they wanted to offer too small a housing project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans who work in the central financial district, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, houses are expensive, and education is expensive, so people put it off", says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to manage my money and my time", says another in his 20's.
Both men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for not having children.
So while the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What's private offline is private online.
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is private property for under-16s?
How can this definition be applied to everyday life and social media?
Does he realize the dangers of posting on the Internet things he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who are regular Internet users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post", says ten-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone", he says.
I post cool pictures or games on FB.
I also talk to my friends.
"I won't share a picture of me or anyone else who would be a fool", he says.
The boy admits that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know his 35 friends on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are family.
Her mother's one of them. She knows the password to one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I just post them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, quickly", he says.
He says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He will not trust anyone who recommends a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friend list.
"I'm not worried about it because we have something in common, like music", he says.
The boy said that no one had ever made a pass at him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account", he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences now known as cyberbullying are not unfamiliar to the young boy.
A friend of mine's family was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he says.
Victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it on as a private profile".
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this youngster would post pictures of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that the goal of social media is to inform children and adolescents.
"The Internet started as a way to find information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are those children and young people who are born with technology.
"We, the digital immigrants, are the ones who have to teach them, while we are learning", she says.
He adds that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a clear standard of what to disclose, publish or say at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what they care about most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and teens about privacy is to use questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is no use", she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend's picture you posted?
Do you know what other people are posting about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people's permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone should act with respect, morality and other principles, it should be the same on social networks", she says.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher, and educational consultant, says that it is vital that parents carefully read the terms and conditions of social networking sites.
By understanding each of these terms, parents will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or post", he says.
Guardia says it is vital to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public.
The 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the 7 delegates present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit closed, then claimed that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents were exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among journalists was provided by the press officers of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, except for the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit's "final statement", but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American-Arab Summit (SASA) and, on that occasion, despite press demands, it did not release the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited information gathering as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru agreeing jointly to accept a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear arguments from both sides in Lima's trial of Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and implement the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today", President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts", added President Piñera, shaking hands with President Humala, beside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the morning deliberations and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total investment of USD 17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He said that measures would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, 'economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and foreshadow a better future for our people,' concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve connectivity in South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects were for Peru and were on the cross-sectional axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were for a larger connection with Ecuador although he did not give the most detailed details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow it to re-enter the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, with integrated and good relations with its neighbours, was another theme discussed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico City on Saturday to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require a discussion with that country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday where they plan to witness the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, the Summit will see the bloc's defence ministers meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
President of Ecuador Rafael Correa today said that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should follow the example of Europe".
President Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make part of the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who are listening to us never compromise, but we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington with US funding", he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision, as he did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
It concluded that at the time, "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
He also criticised the Swedish courts for requiring him to be questioned on his territory about an alleged sexual offence, even though "Sweden's own legislation allows for this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
His physical and mental health may deteriorate if he is confined to a small space and is unable to exercise outdoors.
"It affects everyone's health", he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe pass to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings before different European bodies", he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe passage tomorrow, this would be over".
And if Sweden, as is fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, were to question Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or by Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa used the occasion to reassert himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists who are hired by greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard, he welcomed that it was not such journalists "nor the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than pushing for his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this is destroying the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considered as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not being respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence that the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile would be resolved in the same court and said that it was "beneficial for Latin America to take international action if both countries agree to accept a firm judgment".
Referring to the possibility of running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he saw the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the February 2013 primary, he will retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it will be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health", he commented.
The Ecuadorian President took part today in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now caused by late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed - HIV positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head", he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his own illness and started to learn about it and his determination was so strong that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of one IMSS clinic refused to say goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
In those days, having AIDS was a death sentence.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, many people still arrive unaware of their illness when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and become victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the AIDS outbreak began worldwide, at least after the first cases were reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, citing the fact that this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious diseases expert Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of damage to the immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for those with a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a CD4 count of 500.
Simply put, this means that for someone diagnosed HIV-positive at age 25, "as long as it is under control, he can live safely until age 75", explained the scientist interviewed.
To put this progress in context, the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has risen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to UNAIDS' annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients counted in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we've never run out of drugs, but the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive with an opportunistic infection, and what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is earlier diagnosis and to do this, mass screening testing must be provided to all who ask for it".
The experts and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to have his test done in a private laboratory simply because a friend had done it and who, despite his young age, was already HIV-positive and had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you find out you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have fun three times a week", they say, but I'm not.
The change has been good, I eat right, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am also responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them get tested, if they've taken risks, the sooner they know if they're HIV positive, the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that they can live like everyone else, be responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the average citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest of these lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, that's very good, but the result is that even today, some people still don't have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?" asked sarcastically and with judgment by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists, and health professionals is one that teenagers do not want to hear, says the reporter.
He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters but be found in public toilet machines and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if there would be a condom distribution in his administration.
"That's not how sex works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active", he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in number of HIV patients.
Ninety-two percent of infections are sexually transmitted, six percent are blood-borne, and two percent are perinatal.
An estimated 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are four or five people who don't know it.
A judgment upheld on appeal by a US court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
It seems that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the star-studded country, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on three grounds.
First, while the trial judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are in the form of commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases involving companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity in International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, which was recognised as a critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the subsidiaries' votes remained, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the US courts, i.e. vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation it had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis facing the United States, which was passing costs on to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same court of appeal to have the vote taken in its entirety, that is, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
More seriously, the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") detailing Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, stating that this exempted it from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it on par with Section 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It also notes that the country has complied with the United Nations Commission on International Trade principles, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they stun Vitro and they stun the country.
The general balance sheet
Complaints from the Mexican Aviation Association's unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Airline Pilots' Association has already run into problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority had consistently denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of IXE Bank on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used to purchase shares in the Hotel Professional Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're laying siege to the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at a Caribbean University amphitheater over the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for products from the Great Wall country, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Industry and Processing) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone to oppose the monumental project which is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement on freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, real estate developer Homex went public for 500 million pesos.
This bond issue is the first of four issues for which they offer to pay interest every 28 days.
The birth of Competival
A new consortium, Competival, has just been formed, comprising the leading IT companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, with the aim of developing the clustering software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in this area is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globe-trotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life connected to the court and, thanks to it, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years, whether as a minor league player, a player for the national basketball team, a manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 90s", Reyes recalls during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that recall his extraordinary journey, are proof of this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, his most cherished are those of his time as a player with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a team co-manager or manager.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I was lucky enough to play in eight Vaqueros championships starting in 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or executive.
It was a lot of satisfying years, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was the manager here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, "I have a big player for you, six feet tall.
You want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was a top marksman.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse was gonna help us try to win another.
He was happy to win the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's duties on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the Pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian referee hadn't had us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the team that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 1990 World Cup due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but they gave us a gold medal and a lot of joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Mar del Plata Pan American Games, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
There's no doubt about it, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And that's without taking into account his track record in the different leagues he's played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work Leo Arill does with the young people.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What else is there to do?
There are things I would have liked to have done, such as regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today's youths travel and play too much when it's not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch old videos on YouTube, enjoy time with my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, feared, manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for "Dallas" production company Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas for this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and its sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an exceptional person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and had a liver transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made a name for himself on television as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film roles include critically acclaimed roles in The Band, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful performance of the deliciously obnoxious J.R. that made Larry Hagman his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing family and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", coined to keep the suspense alive around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars in wagers.
This, among other things, made the series a record-breaking show at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't leave town, but other people had reasons to assault her, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable but charismaticly smiling man: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who tried to institutionalize his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take to be an epitaph for J.R"., Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here is the Honorable Citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a man "who was huge, both on the small screen and in real life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us who was lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and a sixth is in the works, the network said.
At this time, neither Warner nor TNT has commented on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the show.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York stage in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met and married the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he published his memoir, Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I have not written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor activist and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I restore their confidence, I go with them when they come for surgery and afterwards", he said in 1996.
I try to give them a little bit of comfort, like, "Don't worry, it won't be easy for a while, but it'll be okay".
He was also a tobacco-fighting activist and participated in several campaigns.
A class on "End of the World" just started
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a class on the end of the world that semester, he knew that he was throwing a powerful hook: the end of the "great countdown" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the months to come: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a tax collapse that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists thought the apocalypse would unfold.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever had", Professor Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, that was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher teaching about "the end of the world" this semester, which is supposed to be the last one in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons, for example, were to fall into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We add '2012' to give us the opportunity to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear", Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be held the day before the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours", Restall said of his course for senior students, which consisted of 35 students.
We received e-mails several weeks before the semester started from people asking if there was still room.
The students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me what people can do to comfort themselves", says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, says he has seen every apocalyptic movie.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject", he said.
I like it.
But none of the students we interviewed, let alone any teacher, told us that they believed the world would end on December 21.
"Our first project was on Maya prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", says 21-year-old Julie Zegel, a Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I do admit that there is an apocalypse anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a surge of such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it", he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew of a class here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not part of the end of the world", he replied, as if he were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years there has been much talk of the supposed dates of the final judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will end.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several of them told us they were thinking about going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call my friends and we laugh together", said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
