No release amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a motion to amend the criminal code to abolish the provisions on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The new rules, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, were rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic offences.
Mr Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for allegedly concluding a disadvantageous contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final and the appeal of the convicts is due to be heard in December.
Mr Tymoshenko himself described the verdict as political revenge by the regime and the trial also raised suspicions in the West of the court's bias.
The motion to remove Article 365 from the Penal Code, which sentenced the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 MPs.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals.
The Libyan Victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now all that remains is to define the winners.
As is the custom in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council accepted the customary law of Sharīʿa, which is now a concept of God.
Libya would be a crime-free country, because for theft, you cut off your hand.
Women too should quickly forget about emancipation, any apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of warring tribes will be united by the Koran.
In short, Libya will have an order that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
- only our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively speaking it is not the best and diversity would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters should even have been helped by the unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse they have is that NATO air strikes were not led by some American general but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The West is not one of them.
We were just taking part in a gun battle, serving the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator of a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to avoid a military occupation of Libya.
This has caused a problem for the local people - the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mock price even without occupation?
It is hardly the case that the West can finally and rightly boast of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
Unless the Sharīʿa agents ruin them.
The beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the spotlight.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm bottomed Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared with the previous quarter, Germany and France are increasing.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and a number of other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% as expected, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher than originally expected growth (0.3% growth instead of the 0.1% forecast), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (initial figures only suggested stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year.
However, GDP stagnated compared with the previous quarter, confirming the trend of slowing economic performance growth, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
So the results are worse than the analysts' predictions.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year, but stagnated compared with the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
The euro area as a whole and the EU economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared with the previous year.
The yield on its 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, there are voices calling for the ECB to become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the toughest challenge of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, they won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football has been able to defend its luxurious home advantage and will once again be present at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge dose of luck in the second.
The Czech national team won 1-0 in Montenegro, thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček, and thus redeemed their ticket for the European Championship.
The Czech team's precise defensive play also allowed them to put more pressure on the Montenegrin side in the second half.
The unlucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two giant chances.
The Czech national team will therefore play in the European Championships next year, thanks to an outstanding Petr Čech, and it is also gratifying that the Czech football is receiving a bonus of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, it was a pretty tough football game.
Both teams combined in a long game and so the game was played mainly around the midfield.
The Czech defense successfully defended the wide shots before the penalty area.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
The aim of this gesture was to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed outside the facility at noon Tuesday and then declared death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They wanted to show that they were ready to protect their country's nuclear program, if necessary even with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran does not appear to have given up on its nuclear weapons program.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon outside the entrance to the compound and then declared death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple the Iranian nuclear programme, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would be the target, according to the Israeli press, from the Isfahan facility.
The menu of an obese child: He doesn't eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children ages 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that children who are obese are more likely to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This once again shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and the examples that surround him are for his healthy development.
The number of sausages on the tables of obese children is up to half that of families with normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the "Obesity is no accident" awareness campaign.
Sports are not a favorite activity in families with fat children, but they are also a favorite activity of the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents make time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the school year last year, and almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic were interviewed.
This was the second year of the 'Obesity is no accident' campaign, supported by the National Health Insurance Fund and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grade have taken part in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are key factors in the alarming increase in children who are overweight or even obese.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed said that they ate breakfast-second-breakfast-lunch-vesper-dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet", says one survey.
No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as a regular family breakfast, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of school families have breakfast.
- And in most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
The worst was the finding that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that families with overweight children are much more likely to eat unhealthy potatoes.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed participate in sports, fewer than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Make your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal plan from the options offered according to appetite and opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 in terms of nutrition are far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many flour dishes, meat dishes, and of course sweets.
"The particular concern is the high popularity of sweet sodas", the final report on the survey stresses.
At lunch, the main course, pasta narrowly beat chicken.
The children were almost completely averse to vegetables and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was also very low.
The return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if given the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the 'obesity is not a coincidence' lecture, there was a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating principles in many cases", the results of the project state.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet Limousines, where many children began to prefer ordinary water.
The children also had a much higher incidence of choosing poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweets.
Professionals say a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In my introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a little bit of a complaint that this was a little too much material to start with.
I had no idea what was coming.
Talks by three industry professionals, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how to do it on the pitch.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks lie ahead.
But even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to dress a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's most of us.
Some have a neck too short, others a figure too youthful without proper curves and still others are chubby.
It is the stylist's job to visually conceal wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez -- big breasts, wide hips, and a slim waist -- pretty and physically, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don't fit, at least one piece should be tailored.
You will not regret it, for well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
Because a tailor-made skirt feels much better than one with a pole that is always too high and sliding, and that sticks out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures, in turn, may allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bumps, applications, embroidery or braiding.
With all this information and character types, I'm glad I have a whole week to think it through.
And yet I'm afraid, given the homework, it's almost impossible to do.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design a suitable outfit for her - a day dress and an evening gown.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style and figure of the star.
I'm supposed to dress up Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm cheering inside, because that's much better for me personally than wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has gained about 100 pounds lately (well, that's a little over the top), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are to be cut from magazines or searched on the Internet, printed, and then graphically edited.
The "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, is then to express our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the magazines (according to specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
We were told about it by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But not until Sunday.
That means a stylist needs to have a good overall view.
The Saturday presentation, which was filled with information on figure types, was immediately spiced up by three industry visitors:
The designers are Jan Pokorný, Jakub Polanka and Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single garment in a variety of ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or a coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put heels on it and wear it as a dress.
You can just roll up your sleeve or your collar and the whole look will look completely different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But the advice that came most to my mind was, "First, you must know the rules perfectly".
"Only then can you hurt her", said Jacob.
I finally understand why we have to dig through all these teaching, what you can combine with what and why, even though you often see something completely different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing options than he ultimately photographs.
So for a ten-page fashion story, you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo, when combined with other accessories, sometimes look very different from what they actually are.
So all of this is to be expected when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný confirmed that image and style are sometimes half the success.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are generally reserved.
Even celebrities often consider this a waste of money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look is secondary).
And if someone is getting styled, we should expect that he or she will probably force a size on us that is quite different (smaller) than what he or she actually needs.
Then you just have to Google it to see for sure that the tabloid press is writing that the celebrity has gained or lost weight, etc.
Jan and Mario encouraged us on Sunday not to think that a stylist should focus only on fashion and then "put together" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he has to be a skilled psychologist.
He's a man who can judge people without offering his opinion.
"If some manager asks us to sift through her closet and add some pretty pieces, we can't just take her out of the closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
"You have to find at least a few things that are commendable to recommend, things that you can contribute to", says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that you button up around your waist and carry all the necessary possessions around with you.
In addition to clear items such as scissors, hair-removal rollers, and safety pins, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (to help the stylist photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to grab the clothing from behind if it is too large (needles or other clamps are not allowed to prevent the fabric from breaking), and, of course, sewing.
But in order to not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes together.
Even when you're shooting in a studio where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of your shoe, let alone the outside one.
We were glued and glued...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, or they'll break.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restriction.
I'm not exactly a man of skill.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend of the continuation course.
One thing I've learned is that it's not easy to be a professional stylist.
V Need for Speed: The Run - the illegal race across America
The review
The initially carefree drive is transformed from a routine drive to the early shift by a series of entirely avoidable, amateurish mistakes.
The Commission has been able to achieve a large part of its ambitions, but what good is that if nobody seems to want to do more?
Even before it hit the store shelves, the new installment, subtitled "The Run", raised high expectations.
He promised to take the aging Need for Speed series to a new level, and in the playable demo examples, it actually seemed to be more than just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious to see how the adapted passages were, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on.
But as you're used to with NFS, the end result is a lot different than you expected.
- Sure, potentially they're pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is dwarfed by some unnecessary bugs that have been present in this series more or less for a few years now.
So they're not really errors anymore, but rather signs of basically incomprehensible laziness on the part of game developers.
The adventure is off to a very good start.
First introduced to the story, the main character Jack has some personal character problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get behind the wheel, with the task of being the first to New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and that each stage takes place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't get the impression for a moment that the game is going to offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very pretty, although the technical level of the graphics is not higher than the previous parts of the series.
So nothing that's going to change the world.
But driving through the desert, through autumn landscapes, or high up through deep snow landscapes is visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, unusual elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, a desert storm can be a surprise, severely limiting your view.
In the mountains, you have to be hell-bent on not being swept away by an avalanche.
Besides, the individual races are quite well arranged.
A few, but enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then you are waiting for a personal duel with a single opponent.
And then the police get involved, trying to screw you over.
One thing that's new is the passages where Jack leaves the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack is running from someone and the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (only three in particular).
In the end, this is more to the advantage, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
I would like to say that, from today's point of view, while it is not uprooting trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it is bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model still does a good job of driving the action-packed car, even though the competition could do better.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only come up after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't entirely OK.
It's hard to expect a game like this to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before you hit any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When passing close or passing oncoming cars, in some places you "slip" the other car only slightly, but in other, almost identical situations you get into a slide and spin wildly.
Or the car's about to go to pieces.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue point of the track.
- Only in every race you only have five restarts.
Once you've used them all, you start all over again.
So the restarts are more like a tool in case something goes wrong, but you shouldn't rely on them.
Sometimes even a restart doesn't help, and the only thing that helps is to memorize the critical section.
The most unpleasant thing is that the same things happen often in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be done in a very specific way, otherwise you just can't get through.
In other places, you will always find "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see your opponent playing past two cars coming towards you, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in a position where you have to overtake or brake.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed to get to this situation right in front of you.
The counterparties have other advantages.
There are a few places in the game where you're always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent, and here again regardless of the time.
The craziest thing is this, at the end of the game, on the long bridge, which you cross in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to overtake someone who's obviously coming out of hell.
And then once it's in front of you, it's obviously going to take your view, so you start out with your car in a bunch a few times.
- Sure, you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but that intention is so clear that it quickly robs you of the pleasure of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and in places so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And it doesn't matter what the "fault" is - the concept of 50 unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something else entirely...
Another unusual idea is the change of car during the race.
The gas stations on the track must not be overlooked, because this is where you can change cars, although in most cases the car you have now is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American sedans for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical drives, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the story mode, there is also the task mode (challenges) - the races in the individual locations known from the story.
Here, not only are there medals, but also experience points to gain for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher level of the driver, various objects must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares one's own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
Another of the incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you drive into a subway tunnel (because of me) and you ride the tracks in the dark (because of me).
The speedometer shows a speed of 150 to 200 kilometers per hour (because of me), but then suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you to the scrap yard.
I think we're gonna be debating for a long time in our office whether this was a blackout by the game designers or whether the writers think we're that stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
What's even more annoying is that in some exciting moments, the repetition rate slows down, and sometimes quite dramatically.
This is particularly true of accidents involving a large number of people, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is fine as far as I'm concerned and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a broad range of younger audiences, a soundtrack was created "from everyone something" - but who buys such a game for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run?
If the game hadn't been reduced by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have said with the breast of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But it kind of makes the game look unfinished.
It's a pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to be stung by these bugs with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with choirs of Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica is now offering for the third time the linking of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this with musical experience.
During the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will introduce themselves.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"Charles University is a big part of the festival".
"The participants include the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, and the festival committee includes the Rector Václav Hampl", said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organising team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of vocational school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme includes the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the halls of the People's House in Vinohrady, which also features university choirs, including those of Charles University.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day and the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The event was co-sponsored by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of Prague, and Václav Hampl, the rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The programme includes, apart from festival concerts, numerous musical meetings, student events, matinees and other events.
The festival is organised by the European Film Academy (EFTA) and is organised by the European Film Council (EFTA).
The EU Ambassador Vicenová said:
The Czechs have a reputation for being pessimistic and Eurosceptic
"The Lisbon Treaty has brought about a tangible shift in the balance between the various institutions".
I did not expect such a hard war to break out".
"It will take five or six years for the tide to settle and for everyone to get used to their new role", Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Law School rather sharply.
She showed how seriously she takes the motto 'Comprehensible and open about Europe' in the first part of her talk, in which she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations with each other in such a comprehensible and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
She also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official not fit for such a role, but I must say that it took everyone's breath away how well he handled the matter.
"He is a man who is able to listen patiently to 27 Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how the EU should proceed.
She then explained that the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union?
No one wants to ban us from our oil caps quarrel
Mrs Vicenová also spoke about the agenda in which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success, she said.
The Czech Republic had overcome the financial and gas crises and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
The Ambassador said that not only during the Presidency but also during the crisis that followed it, which has not yet been overcome, things were quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated given the current economic situation.
The Commission is also proposing a budget for the period from 1 January to 31 December.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'Understandable about Europe'.
"If there's one thing I don't like, it's creepy abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I as a citizen know whether Brussels is really making up curvy or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from quarrelling?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in the future
The EU Ambassador believes that the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
The Czech representation in the European institutions is all the more disturbing.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, including the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you guys doing, sticking your heads together - is that your V4 again?'
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are eligible for EU funding.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more real than a 'European federation'.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation".
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate that want to and those that do not should stand aside".
'There will be more and more of these institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'', she expects.
It also welcomed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM enters its second century
If you were to look for a word that best describes IBM's strategy, it would be "longevity".
IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution for the general public, and is known as a modern company, although it has been around for a century.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He was already advocating the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark around which the life of the future giant was to unfold (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture that Watsen had prepared thoroughly.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a century because it stayed true to its principles and didn't shy away from changing everything else around it.
And that allowed us to transform technology, business and society in our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, in celebration of the anniversary.
A thoughtful system
Watson was already providing social welfare for his employees in the 1930s - similar to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM employees were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer plus elegant work uniforms and a well-thought-out remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant at recruiting talent from the start - as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to replace Palmisan at the helm of IBM next year with a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, previously holding the position of head of operations, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, which has led to many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An Institution with a Good Reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an institution than a technology company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology", added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference between merely being present on the market and directly shaping it by that presence.
IBM - known in the United States by its family name "Big Blue" - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It's one of the most versatile technology companies ever -- IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products -- from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, the automatic teller machine, credit cards, financial swaps, barcode, and the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of about $220 billion, IBM was the second-largest technology company (after Apple) that year, overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Ahead
Not all products and innovations were to the taste of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempts with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is about moving forward, so you can't get emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms -- and if they don't work, leaving them.
Unlike our competitor Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Technology with promise
IBM's profits are mainly generated by services, with software and hardware accounting for one fifth each.
Hardware was still the most represented sector in 1990, with a share of over 50%.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, but in the same period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
IBM continues to invest in these businesses after 2008, when the recent financial crisis first swept the world like a storm.
Here too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first chief executive, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is surviving the current crisis unscathed.
IBM shares have skyrocketed in value by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's net income is continually growing.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only values cannot.
This is another reason why we can expect this flexible giant to cope with the next crisis.
The history of IBM: From the cheese slicer to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, began with a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924, when it was originally a trademark for a branch office in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the future IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history goes back to the 1880s.
They had technology, such as the famous stick clock, to register the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the board of directors until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader even eclipsed the founders of IBM, and Watson's ideas are still the basis of the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat on the board for forty years, until his son, Thomas Watson Jr., succeeded him.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960's, engineers and computers at IBM helped NASA to guide space missions to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous manned flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of the time was released in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but it also bought the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby fully entering the business of consulting and high value added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off for the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technology in a smart way in areas not even planned before, for example to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the Smart Commerce platform, which is designed to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, where a world-class research team is also based, working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep this donkey. I don't want it anymore.
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now her patience is finally over and she has set herself clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not as my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová took refuge in her own house, she would not have dreamed of how it would end with her husband.
When Iveta insisted on moving back to Říčany after 30 days, Josef went right away.
Yes, he even admitted publicly that he loved her.
In time, Darina gave up, even seemed to want to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the slip.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not be welcomed back home with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to spend his days in our home together, I'm not going to kick him out".
"Not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have some ties", confided Mrs. Rychtářová, but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door for him, Joseph still carries with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm staying with Iveta, that's not gonna change".
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that".
"The business continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I do the purchases".
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, except that we don't share the bed", said J. Rychtář (to the newspaper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or whoever.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility.
The worst female vices, how about you?
When men are asked to name some typical female vices, they will, without exception, shake some of them out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where we're reviewing some of the mischief that makes men bleed?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of shit a week?
You like to shop, but can you do a little more at the sale?
Then I guess your case is really a weakness.
At least some women are aware of this and try to keep their shopping habit under control.
But let's face it, what woman can stand to wander through a clothing store looking for a good-fitting outerwear and not try on all the colors in the cabin?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often hell for men.
Think about how many times you've told your husband you'd rather stay out.
Constant Discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least 10 pounds [5.5 kg] - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does this look familiar to you?
- I did?
Then you're probably one of those women who's totally obsessed with how they look.
That's not to say you should let go, but a lot of men are allergic to their wives constantly complaining about their looks.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming increasingly intolerable.
Putting Order and Cleanliness First
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
You scold your partner for trampling on clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you scold your children for having dirty the sink you just cleaned and for having fingerprints on the glass door of the living room closet when polishing is taking so much effort?
If you suffer from this "deviance", you should know that nothing is to be overdoed and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the priority.
This excessive indulgence in cleanliness can also end up damaging relationships and, especially, the peace of the family.
Stinging
"Dirty sweatpants go in the laundry basket".
"Do you really want to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor".
When your mate is exposed to such a rant, do not be surprised if it makes him feel bad.
Of course, I don't mean any harm. They just want everything to be in order.
If men knew this, women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, to be patted on the back or even slandered or to forge alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to go through things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think every woman has a little harmless gossip in store.
I swear to God, that's what all women are like.
This is not to be confused with the most vulgar gossips, who regard nothing and no one as sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who pose a considerable danger, especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to victory with their assists
Ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr had a big part in Philadelphia's 5:3 win over Carolina on the ice with two assists in Monday's NHL game and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star's overview benefited Claude Giroux in both cases, who added another assist and was named the game's best player.
Two assists in the same game were also recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr told reporters that he had predicted Giroux a great night.
"I'll tell him before the game he scored a hat trick today".
I kind of had a feeling".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", said Jágr, whose action saw Giroux score a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second hit had a Czech trace.
Voráček fought back to capture the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third started, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third was then again the Flyers's.
I mean, specifically Giroux.
In partnership with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three", Jágr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm so happy for you".
"I'm cutting my game to me".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been playing me, and now the tide is turning", said Jágr with a smile.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic - with the goals of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who won from a penalty, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read avoided any further complications, however, in which he was successful in a two-to-one advantage.
"Excellent performance by Pronger in our zone".
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out", Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
With this win, Philadelphia is sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and was sent off in the second third because of a head injury.
The Candiens, along with their experienced Beck, also lost their lead in the penalty shoot-out, unbeaten 2:3.
One of the penalty shots Tomáš Plekanec could not convert.
The coach of the home team was probably more hurt by the high number of sickness-related losses in the defense than by the lost points - they finished the game with only five defenders.
"This is bad".
"We ended the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young players".
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"Each shift brought one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to fight back".
"We should have made the game easier and gotten the puck out of our third".
There were reserves here", said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended 30 shots from Tampa Bay, contributing to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
The Jets, who ended a streak of five straight losses, had five different shooters in their pockets.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporttourist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West only selected ones were allowed.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea, and Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also allowed, when Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A major paradox of the socialist era was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the CSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, travel agencies offered tours to the West, but then you had to accept huge lines or sleep in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter was far from settled.
The so-called currency pledge - the condition for leaving for the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a currency bond it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, so it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and cottages - a practice that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a Czech travel revolution.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which is no longer even recognized today, is the fact that the most popular holiday destination for Czechs - Croatia - was not even accessible until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the currency obligation in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished, which led to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
This is how Czech holidaymakers slept in a park tent on trips to Paris, because who could afford a hotel or a boarding house back then?
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs at that time was a suitcase packed with canned goods, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech króna - after decades, our tourists could finally freely buy Western currency.
Our living standards and, as a result, our average wages rose, which ushered in another important moment in 1997.
The increase in demand for travel led travel agents to start preparing for regular charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-vintage travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was booked due to high demand.
Since then, direct charter flights carrying Czech passengers have been flying to sunny countries far away every year, and this year, 12 exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
Hundreds of thousands of Czechs travel to exotic countries every year.
Another significant moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday including the cost of the holiday destination.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman, and the threat that Ivan Hašek's successor at the helm of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
The Commission has not yet reached agreement on the electoral procedure.
And without it, there can be no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three people are interested in managing Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, having called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
- only in the post-Hasek era did the old quarrels between the two chambers of the federation, which cannot agree on a common candidate, re-emerge.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in Prague's Smíchov district for nothing, because the negotiations had led to no result and it was not just about the election itself.
The Commission has not yet been able to reach agreement on the voting rights of the members of the Assembly - only the statutory representatives or the officials with a mandate.
On this point alone, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which considered that proxy representation was not appropriate.
The dispute over the electoral system, however, continues.
The Commission has also been unable to clarify the matter, since its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, have in principle no other items on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how do you go about the third round to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which represents professional football in management.
The constitutional model is that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count should receive at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two preliminary rounds would be pointless, this would call into question the whole two-chamber concept", Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would prefer not to change the electoral rules but to vote according to the current statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even though it is clear that the constitutional electoral system is the one most likely to suit Pelta.
"My wish is that the elections be conducted as strictly as possible in accordance with the Constitution".
'To avoid making nonsensical alternatives like the last general meeting,' explained the owner of the club, Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and who was particularly opposed to Pelta in his comments.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He believes that the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and that the candidates will continue to work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Championship today would certainly help to calm the minds".
"When football is on a wave of euphoria, the willingness to cooperate is also greater", says the Jablonec official, who brings the most experience of the three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous".
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there is some effort to 'correct' the regulations for their own purposes".
"Therefore, a new blockade at the general meeting is not excluded".
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail", said Rajchl.
- There's just not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete before the qualifying match.
The charter plane, which was to take Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica, was unable to take off in Prague the next morning due to a technical failure and so a feverish search was made for an alternative way to bring part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage game.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to get the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to agree.
The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is to set a new direction for Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík is running for the chairman's position because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen football club, had been able to present a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his expectations about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and forgo the election".
"But in the current situation, we have not been able to find such an adept", Paclík told ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
He would have liked to see an experienced top manager who wasn't too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some of the people who might be interested".
"I can hardly believe that some people told me that they did not want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"I wish such views would change", he said.
Most of all, Paclík is reportedly bothered by Pelta's connection to the chairman of the Pilsen County Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered behind the scenes a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate votes at general assemblies.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
"His victory would preserve the situation we have today and Czech football would not progress at all".
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football", Paclík stressed.
He also points out that Pelta's name was recently implicated in a corruption investigation in connection with telephone interceptions, but that Pelta was released without charge.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta win would bring to football".
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who is more relaxed about his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman".
If Paclík wins the election on Thursday, however, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík had backed before the October general assembly, which ended in a fiasco, feels the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to".
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team".
"But I don't think he's qualified to run the association as a manager".
"I don't stick my nose in things I don't understand", said Paclík, who made headlines in September by calling off the arbitration panel with Luďěk Macela at the helm, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels he is up to the role of association president.
He also claims to be the boss of Pilsen, which won its first league title in May with his support.
"I have the power to make a difference in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which can lead to even more nasty situations", said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
One of his priorities is to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the key things the new chairman should be focused on".
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they also have to say clearly where the money goes", he said.
Paclík also does not consider his connection to the Pilsner club a handicap, although he himself stresses that the FAČR chairman must be "transpartisan".
Pelta is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal".
"But I also think it makes little sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in a hypocritical way and then come back after a year and a half", Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would prevent a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general assembly of the FA, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected he would push for the FAČR to be given new statutes that would rule out future disputes over the electoral system.
The official from Jablonec is confident about Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely be tempered by a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had promised before the failed election in September that if elected he would focus on the national team and raising funds.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about football management and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be announced on Thursday".
"He feels it is high time that someone takes over the association", said the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club but also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hašek is responsible for the problems with the election today.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not as complete as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed for different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September", said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association as a lure for the delegates.
"If I am to become chairman, I will take it personally and be prepared to take personal responsibility if it does not work out".
"This is a fundamental thing that he cannot do without", says Pelta.
He does not try to separate himself from his opponents.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also stopped attacking Tomáš Paclík, who again left no dry thread on Pelta.
He has been playing football for over a year and has already had some success".
"His attacks were demeaning, however, and many people were shocked by his campaign".
"That is why many now doubt his true character", Pelta told his opponent, who is likely to remain true to his proclamations made in September.
He believes that his greatest weapon is his knowledge of football, from the lowest levels to the national team.
And this was supposed to be the poster for Czech football.
"I would also make every effort to end all affairs, from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately go into negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure sufficient funding for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all the employees", he said in the direction of Strahov, where, understandably, there is nervousness because of the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only issue really should be how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it".
"Football needs credibility and the only way to regain it is to finally have a new leader", Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career as a functionary.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the current vice-chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, were elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly upset many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, you will start working hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football departments.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole".
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football, to youth football".
"I'm not saying I want to do everything alone", Rajchl told ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area".
And I'm going to assign hard tasks so that football in every segment moves forward with milestones".
Many would not be too happy about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves", he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I've considered not running at all.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't keep throwing sticks between my legs and questioning every step I take", he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me not to give up because others would too".
"That's a trust you can't lose", he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"We've done a lot of work in two years, and I don't want to throw it away".
"Trial processes have been launched which will probably only come into force in a few years and I would not like to see them stopped", he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - is elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring".
"He's got people behind him who would make football for the chosen few".
I may be accused of some things, but not of being partial".
"I try to be objective".
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say otherwise, I really intend to do the best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian section, the winners of which would then be promoted to the first league".
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia", Rajchl says.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the chairman's position, Rajchl is not afraid to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me", said Rajchl, who also considers the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, the agreement on television revenues and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association is not pulling together.
While he says of Pelta that he is "disqualified from the start to help Czech football regain confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík - a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year".
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has started and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the Commissions".
He would certainly not want to turn things to his advantage", says Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
♪ Jump into the blue ♪
By Julia Stanek
Swimming pools with UFO sights, and swimming pools in Budapest: Travelers in Europe can experience the wonders of the blue - and after a city tour or a hike, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the last year and a half, she couldn't miss one thing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Lying back on the water, she looked up at the ornate domes, swam toward marble pits waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bathroom, she would quickly write it down in her notebook - including interesting details about the building's design and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by architectural historian Meder - and she now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": popular swimming pools in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She travelled through 13 countries on her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She says she doesn't have much of a problem with sports - only in the water.
The only annoyance is that swimming enthusiasts have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine fumes while joggers can breathe in the enchanting scent of pine forests or listen to the joyful song of birds in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths".
Water surface area doubled Architecture
The reason for the high well-being factor in baths is that all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders put in the effort, swimming pools can be a delight: "In place of a floor, you have a surface of water in baths".
"It's transparent on the one hand, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building".
Everything is visually doubled: high vaults, colorful tiles, jump boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" contains 190 pages of information on the architectural and cultural history of historic spa oases - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent thermal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing body of water in a rugged karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While the Zurich rooftop bath offers a view of the entire city, the outdoor pool of a St. Anton bath can be used to gaze out over the snow-covered Arlberg - and the steam room has a window from which you can watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most unusual design of the pool awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Three open bowls evaporate in winter, while the mountains of the Oetzel valley rise to the sky in the background.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every pool the pool collector went to got the smell of chlorine up her nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells so badly of heating oil that it is hard to believe it has landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrocarbonated healing water, which is almost black and its glue sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a unique wellness experience.
But Iris Meder's search for beautiful bathing sites was disappointing in one place: When she tried to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area in Bad Luhatschowitz, Czech Republic, she found a fenced-in area.
The bathhouse, designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
As Meder peered through the weathered windows of the red, white, and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay was counteracted by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already undergone three phases of construction, and you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally came from the Black Forest.
"It is an achievement to combine so many different styles of building into one great unit", says Meder.
In a palace like this, the immersion in the thermal pool is obviously just a side thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is running a raw material review
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to study the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
- The Hamburg
For German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those surveyed even demand that Deutsche Bank and other lenders exit the business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity markets drives prices higher - and banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank's CEO Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that gamblers have disconnected themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike its US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and saying that no business was "worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is currently investigating the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The results of the audit are expected to be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Management by the end of the year, with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
The Bank's management will then announce its consequences at the end of January.
The result could be a reduction in raw material trade, or even a complete reversal.
Ackermann is tinkering with his image
Foodwatch's chief executive, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news but reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The bet on rising food prices is a particularly stark illustration of how ruthless banks are hurting the common good today".
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments where money is used to bet on food prices", Bode said.
"Whether it's about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect image a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not be moving to the supervisory board as planned.
By abandoning the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly cares about the potential losses - after all, his successor would have to deal with them.
One in two would quit raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent of respondents consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they knew their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would abandon all investments that invest in commodity speculation, the survey found.
Forty-three percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, and 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account and moving to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending: the Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern postwar architecture is to be admired, with its clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion designed by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a fitting and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he built the Austrian Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bullet-shaped side-building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, converted and opened a 20th-century museum in 1962 - it was called the "20th House".
But the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna found a new home.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and falling down.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, which owns the house, opens its first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new beginning has been carried through by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with a notable career as a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed through the conversion with political and historical preservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookstore were to be built, and an office building was to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krishnanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he had studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "tremendously important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
The current renovation had far greater problems: The building was "a waste of energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, fibreglass reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Steel beams for cold bridges have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two basements made room for the new use, a low light pit between the house and the street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-proof paint.
And the theater is still exactly as it was.
And all under strict supervision of the Antiquities Authority and with a small budget.
"Often, we had to find a good, cheap material that the Heritage Board liked", says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, which "came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "raise a right consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has been a case of urban luck: around the Swiss Garden is being built the completely newly planned "Mainbahnhofquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky breakthrough may yet come: the 21st house could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as we hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railways plans multi-million euro winter crisis package
The railroad has developed a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train delays and cancellations, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The 'Bild' newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments totalling around EUR 300 million were planned by 2015.
This is to ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The plan included doubling the number of internal and external staff for snow removal on railway installations and platforms to 16,000.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by the time they start operating and 90 per cent of the routes needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train outages and delays this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, due to a shortage of reserves, for example in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railways Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it necessary for years to have ICE trains' axles checked in the workshop significantly more often after an ICE at Cologne Central Station broke its axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After the tumult over the boss Josef Ackermann, another trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with its past in the United States: The Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million in a settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The NCUA, the financial market regulator, accuses a number of large banks of misleading the cooperative banks into buying the financial products with false promises, downplaying the risks.
Such securities lost much of their value during the financial crisis and caused the banks to collapse.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any debt in the settlement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to recover the billions in damages.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also been tapping other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage-backed securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a disaster for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events took place some years ago, the US banking system is currently in a headwind.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous lawsuits seeking compensation or punishing wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has caused the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having outbid the two state-owned US real estate lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions worth some $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA concerning several transactions worth a total of USD 14,2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority requires the Frankfurtes to bear 'substantial losses', without however specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it would defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is heavily invested in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought up more than ten billion dollars worth of stock.
Up until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always said that he would not invest in IT and computer companies because the long-term development of the companies was poorly predictable.
Now, however, he had read IBM's financial statements and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily a service provider and that it procured computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's achievement in the financial world.
The IT parent company IBM is now entitled to be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett just revealed on CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn't heard of the engagement.
He praised the management for making decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been investing in the lucrative IT services of data centre operations for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting services as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had been avoiding tech companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett went after a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer, or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company owns around 80 of his own subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with smart investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money has earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
After Buffett's investment became known, IBM stock went up by one percent in the open market.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to join.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the "Zwickauer cell" was exposed, Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The report is being met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a ghost long thought dead is returning: since the firebombings in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
The network of right-wing extremists exposed, however, reveals a scale far beyond what can be foreseen.
"Is the bloody ideology coming back?" was the headline of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely: it held a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend to remember the victims of racial violence.
Only two weeks earlier the Turkish community in Berlin had joined German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The two had been staged in a happy way - as a success story.
The headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform Haber X, which refers to the background of the murder series, is "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary".
The German edition of the Hurriyet also makes this connection.
"It's starting to stink", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stresses that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The police's actions and their subsequent success in the search are being discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums in a highly critical manner.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared to take drastic measures: "If this continues to be a mess, the migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves".
"That's probably the best self-defense".
"The quality of the information and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network are very much dependent on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace of Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burning ruins of Solingen is deeply ingrained in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, have heightened the feeling of We on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen bombing, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It's like measuring a person's worth by their tax dollars.
The current reporting in the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the rule of law has grown since then.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively clarify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now I want a German to fix it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was happy in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September it was clear that things would be very different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and embezzled about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has also been considered a victim since then - and everyone is asking: when will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a central banker and would certainly have needed some time to get used to it.
He then takes over the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of Europe's biggest scandal bank.
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing seems to be spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of a quiet, solid but also a brash Swiss wealth manager with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a big name in investment banking.
So in 2007, UBS, on the one hand, managed $1.6 trillion more money from high net worth clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking in Zurich, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank".
"Looking back now, you wonder how I could have been so wrong".
He was wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was seriously wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who had been considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, unexpectedly resigned.
A few months later, they figured out why he left.
The bank's investment arm had been bogged down with subprime debt and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
It did find investors, but some that some would have been surprised to hear about until recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that its name was not even known.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and its chairman Marcel Ospel, still the second highest paid member of the board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced conversion loan, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it realized how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks.
Finally, UBS' balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the size of the Swiss economy (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS", says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Within months, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the bank's help.
It also agreed to pay $780 million in restitution for unjust profits from these transactions, including penalties.
UBS thus more or less openly admitted to having helped to avoid tax.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the race for rich clients: the umbrella of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not the same.
The resignation of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board of Directors followed.
And the exodus of client funds.
The Bank had lost its credibility in two key areas of business within a few months: investment banking through mis-speculation and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just when things were getting a little quieter, just when you thought UBS was going to get it right, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer is ripping off 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes something is wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"The Adoboli case showed that the risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risk".
The idea of becoming the custodian of the world's great fortunes, not taking too great risks, but ensuring the safety of money - should the world collapse even beyond the Alpine republic - had long ago been the idea of the Swiss bankers.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the established Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
It's a classic situation.
The Bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the rents of the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among traditional Swiss shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, it has been the home of Swiss banks, from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The reception hall of UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, fronted by thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large sign that says "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer wants here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank was eventually displaced by both the large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, because he, like all Swiss bankers, also does business with the two big banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if they did, they must have long since adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways".
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss major bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became apparent.
"That Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided on the largest bailout in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians allocated up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, to save the bankrupt big bank.
How did this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge group.
The result was a bank that was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it kept growing.
The two distinct predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a wealthy but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the international investment bankers were getting a lot of money cheaply, and they could spin a giant wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who worked his way up from banking to the top".
But Ospel ended up relying on Woffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
What's clear is that pride came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: "Depose Goldman Sachs".
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the league tables, the rankings that documented the success of banks at the time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already made some steps.
She was at the top of the currency and stock markets.
However, the consultants who were engaged pointed out a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking jargon of "fixed income", there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime investments.
It became a giant machine that packed and passed securities on American mortgages - but at the same time kept risks to itself.
Even when other banks were already looking to exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American housing market was on fire, UBS bought there", says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than expected.
UBS positions became a sling seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has a job that's almost impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger has an idea: end investment banking, focus on wealth management, return to Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is going to shrink sharply, that much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank president Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swissman was originally intended as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly split from its predecessor Grübel.
The Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday that it has now established itself as the permanent head of UBS's business.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 posts.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she? - I don't know.
What's she gonna do for money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
He's only said publicly that he and his wife are going to find an apartment in Zurich.
- Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock markets
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome was not a success.
The continent's cramped industrial production stifled hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were half full last week, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the spotlight, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
The most important financial assets were on the sales notes.
The Dow Jones Standard Value Index closed at 12,078 points, down 0.6 percent.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points during the course of trade.
The broad S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The technology stock market index Nasdaq dropped 0.8 percent and exited trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax fell by 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has reduced production significantly and is adjusting to the end of the boom.
The companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, Eurostat reported.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
Instead, Buffett threw away a decades-old principle and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and made it initially quoted almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed at $187.35 almost unchanged.
Buffett has reportedly paid an average of $170 a piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
His investment firm Berkshire Hathaway's stock price dropped 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell by 2.6 percent, much more than the market.
The house is converting almost all of its remaining shares in China Construction Bank into silver, for which it will collect $6.6 billion.
The net profit from the business is intended primarily to bolster the capital ratio and thus to comply with stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased its production, limiting the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the company received its biggest order in history.
Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, valuing the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
Some 710 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
At 1.38 billion shares, 630 stocks on the Nasdaq closed up, 1913 down and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds", but experts say that the highly intelligent animals are no longer drivable from cities.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but in many communities residents are complaining about the dirt and noise of the animals.
The problem is that no cure for the "problem birds" is yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer available in cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Void.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the migration of specially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increased cultivation, and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the soest region of Westphalia, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, a controversial project to kill crows in the county in 2005 had made negative headlines.
Critics had described the animals' being caught in bird traps and beaten with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal eviction, the mourning, does not bring anything", noted urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are drifting away, large colonies are splitting up and spreading to other places".
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the directive.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away".
Without the countryside, the problem in cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of removing animals from sensitive habitats and offering to relocate them is conceivable.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws", in contrast, promoted psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different approach to animals: "A pimple on the face is the best thing we can endure with confidence".
Jürgens had helped to found the Aschberg Crow Training Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being embraced by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say".
The animals' intelligence and skill are legendary: Not only do seed crows use tools to get a treat, but they even make their own tools.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the intelligence of four seeds of the raven.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to knock down a scaffolding to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a rock would have to have to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in it.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers had wired them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with which they would then pull the bucket out of the tube by the handle.
Three of the four seed crows actually did this at first.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting for Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-time superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive perfect appearance at the European Championship after the 0-0 draw.
The Czechs were handed a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off replay against outsider Montenegro, after the second leg (2:0) had already been a clear affair.
Croatia also lost 0-0 to Turkey, while Ireland scored a loose 1-1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted half-century (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice been shortlisted for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
Portugal got off to a good start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 yards to the early lead in the nets.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range skills and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnian, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg international from England's top-flight Manchester City put a header on the bottom of the net, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
The next day, the focus was on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided to go for Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial handshake after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who Misimovic safely converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice champion cleared it all with four goals.
Petr Jiracek finished the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will now compete in the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legioners Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a scary second in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored from the corner of the penalty area in the 40th minute, just a short distance past Cech's goal.
After the break, the cross-country had to save the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had retired (50.).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the Zagreb football miracle.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0 draw.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to be on the bench for the third World Cup in 2002, the Croats are looking forward to their fourth appearance in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit the post with a distance shot in the seventh minute, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the off-spinner in the goal.
But after the second of terror, Croatia took over more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in the game.
Trapattoni is going to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the lead in the 32nd minute for the team, led by trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already secured a preliminary victory with a 4-0 win in the match.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) was equally at ease with the guests.
Ireland pushed for the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear prevent the possible lead shot.
But in the 32nd minute, it was time.
After a poor defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1-0 across the line.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, is investing billions in China in the next few years and aims to almost double its workforce in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire staff accordingly", co-CEO Bill McDermott announced at a customer show in Beijing.
The number of employees is expected to increase from the current around 2500 to 4500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to 10 or 11.
The Commission has already established that the Chinese exporting producers are in a similar situation.
Some 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are in the booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...) ", McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education".
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book, "Beauty and Horror: A History of the First World War, Told in Nineteen Fates", begins with a long list of key characters that touch your heart.
Here's a tip: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's novel, and these main characters will act as your GPS, as a beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and stripped of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which decides the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he describes not unfairly as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, no important contracts, no famous battles, no ambassadors, no angry reporters, no discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was".
"Beauty and Horror" is almost the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are going to be heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad, or die.
Each of these lives flickers like votive candles in a church, some add up while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was just the devastating post war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and the Beast" explores other war zones with expertise: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are falling beehives, one is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the start.
War floods these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordite.
Imagine you're a woman at home with her children and you hear cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming, anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being waged in the first place.
"Falling facts", notes Englund, "were furnished with conjecture, assumption, hope, fear, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and the Beast" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in the englunds of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them are about scarcity and self-care.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Substitute, substitute everywhere".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bands, wooden buttons, and so on".
He's telling us more about the alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in ram fat (and served last with a false wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were sewn with wood".
He notes that "there were 837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
Recognizing his own drive for savagery, one American says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what was meant for men rather than sitting in the armchair with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, pretending that such a facade means civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one's strengthened and patched shirt chest".
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will notice or care.
"When you put off the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think that it's happening in front of an audience", he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret".
Other observations concern the old Europe falling apart and new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", writes Englund, "a war between factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the younger century": "the word-savvy and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a suit who slaughters while sitting at a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways, and there are frivolous behaviors as well as heroic ones.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract an venereal disease from a prostitute in order to escape frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonorrhoea pus, for soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital", he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which left them blind for the rest of their lives".
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes fluid and yet unobtrusive, perfectly adapting to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I were mostly fiction, like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, rather than comprehensive history books.
Englund's band is joining an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it away.
But it's like he took that page of his book with the main characters right in front of us and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault.
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing combat helmets.
The night was set for Monday to Tuesday because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed they were taking part in a drill.
Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, like the pepper spraying of protesters, which violates the department's rules and has given the squatters a huge boost in public sympathy, must not be repeated.
And so the police operation to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared for this by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had been held on Randall's Island with a view of Zuccotti.
Officials stepped up so-called Chaos Training - counterterrorism measures that include rapidly relocating large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise".
"The few officers involved, to my knowledge, didn't know it was Zuccotti Park", said one person who wished to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew about Zuccotti Park were the top officials of the department".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials tried to clear the park but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers usually deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people are in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the park has the least number of people", he said.
Emergency vehicles with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were standing by at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before the descent.
The lamps and pre-recorded messages that thundered from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials in their bright blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply packed up and left.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the police chief, said this was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim they were prevented from watching the police action in the park and they said the officials' treatment was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV vans could have taken pictures in Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westward through the confusion of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, plastic bags, and bags of clothes, they were followed by city cleaners who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, images of which were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A core of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the center of the camp banded together in arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster response officials were called in to cut it off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
Police said the evacuation was completed in 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were for "improper behavior and resisting arrest".
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the Criminal Investigations Division, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not direct the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officers was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block further south.
From these locations, the police were seen to expand their perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officers, many of them wearing protective shields, were seen driving people out.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the southern part of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters blew air out of a police bus.
At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The caregivers' union is going to sue the city for redundancies.
The union, which represents hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate impact on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option left open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's lowest paid employees and lost their jobs in a strike on October 7 that union leaders described as political revenge for last year's denial of the city's access to a health fund run by the work groups to fill the budget gap.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, superintendent of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A city councilman shot back and explained that the budget did not specify that school help workers would be laid off.
Officials at City Council 37 said they have and have warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and will include eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Hispanic, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit filed with the New York Times, the union focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's slums to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
It explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school help workers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 help workers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were laid off.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of poor parents who can organize donations to make up for budget cuts".
P.S.: The 36th District's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra funding for every poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the high school principals were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" in the US usually describes the transfer of a teacher from the payroll of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred", the complaint states.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are finally coming to an agreement on the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution, chaired by John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honours the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of her democratic efforts by two parties".
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House were fighting over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and it did not come to a vote.
But on the same day, the bill passed the Senate, and the House passed a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
This put the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama's conduct of the mission, but not angry enough to finally tear the ground from under him.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who are supporting military operations to protect the people of Libya for their exceptional courage and professionalism".
The resolution also reaffirms the 'national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya'.
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislature as the June law did?
The final version is met with opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indianapolis, the top Republican on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, the Senate is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other area to be put to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to get their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatt's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double-edged - the same bill has been introduced in both Congress and Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendment in the Senate alone and a dozen more that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their employers - especially newcomers to the Republican Party who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to brag that they "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can introduce, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limit on two terms of office for the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that include the right to good education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is a recurring theme, as is an amendment prohibiting flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
The Commission is also proposing a new programme for the development of the European Community.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced 77 such amendments.
The pace is a fad from the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Meet but not defeated", Giffords said in her first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range during a campaign rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Giffford of Arizona appeared on national television Monday night singing solo to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said her desire to recover was greater than her desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, she was at a loss for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and cut through her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to vote triumphantly for the debt brake.
In her first television interview since the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was, Gifford, 41, replied: "Very well".
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded just before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
This special follows Gifford's recovery from the January 8 assassination.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in a hospital bed, shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to.
Months later, Giffords is in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lip.
And then, her first words, "What".
A few days later, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played a major role in Giffords' recovery, with the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read Gifford a daily newspaper article about the assassination on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, is in a Missouri prison and is undergoing mandatory medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"Many people have died", Gifford's Sawyer told me.
"Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard".
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I was hit".
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated'?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than you ever were.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A clue led to a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathering around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the troops' role differently.
"They were brought in as orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you did.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are being overwhelmed with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if people in uniform are hurting them.
"We were not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be deployed to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to help is to push ourselves into the role of unhappy souls".
The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that was felt by the returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are silent and private conversations about compassion between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, A.D. Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world might view their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look on them with awe, having defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran" was hiding beneath the surface, said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-ranking government post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers subtly asked if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding position in Washington right after he returned from the war.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must counteract the negative impressions", Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of ease in the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest Americans have in war.
The achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little military experience and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way that it was absolutely common during World War II", said Lieutenant General David Barno, A.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a public servant.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether to charge 28 women and men with failure to intervene in a rape case before a military court.
If that doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Petty Officer Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October of 2008, and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend when she came across a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off", Lyman said.
But the Texan girl put her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut".
Minutes after they went into Lyman's room, the man stepped in behind her, pushed her down, and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admissible in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread rape within the military and violated the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide adequate justice following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's tracking the top military leadership since that's where the problem starts.
"The military is hierarchical", she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says she's contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will file many more lawsuits if necessary to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court documents that Newsweek has detailed the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained while in the armed forces.
Because of a Supreme Court law from 1950, known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged damages were incurred during the plaintiffs' military service", the document states.
The Department of Defense declines to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the difference is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contacting local women in war zones.
The result was that between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she's not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Regardless, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to be discharged from the service - a common practice, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of claims for persons who reported being sexually abused in the service.
Nine bills have been independently introduced to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, the Department of Defense's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response reported 3,158 cases of sexual assault.
But most abuses go unreported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military went to court, only half as many as in the civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had had with her boyfriend prior to the assault.
Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged offender, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going into labor, and I ran screaming out of the courtroom".
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember coming out and telling my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his procedure.
Lyman was told to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she receives no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed will make any headway is purely speculative, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should move forward".
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind because they don't have the same incentive and deterrence that liability does.
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are introduced", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many young men who posted their anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to committing a shooting in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer before his attack and chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's concealment of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or a new diet product, the ads invited users to a survey asking about their education level, their attitudes toward violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to poll more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave their offices.
"It's a fairly new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the findings are hardly surprising: online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens".
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends like likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title increase by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you wouldn't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"In the past, when you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have let them in", says Bartlett.
"With Facebook, all that's gone - you go straight to them".
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunkenness on Facebook were significantly more likely to have a drinking problem than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as residential counselors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We've found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found".
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site's data team compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its vast data mine available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not, and to play Scrabble with a friend who's thousands of miles away, you allow the site to post your personal information.
But what if Facebook users are part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines for how they collect their data offline, online, everything is allowed.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study that examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was all about her and her friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of what's on a user profile and in posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", says Selwyn.
So Selwyn, despite his years as a technology researcher, still thinks that a clipboard and a pen are the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research has to deal with the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings in Norway this summer that killed 77 people, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight of the Norwegian temple", he told a courtroom of more than 500 people.
"I object to the court's decision because you have been appointed by organizations that support hate ideologies and because that supports multiculturalism".
"I recognize the law, but I plead not guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in pre-trial detention for another 12 weeks, he was banned from the media for four weeks, and he said authorities would closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he would remain behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything would come to a close.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", a Utoya survivor told NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but I'm going to move on after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like to think that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically alleviate the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said the relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did".
7 Lessons from the Late Steve Jobs Interview, which was shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technological genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week before special movie screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who worked hard on diagrams -- a man who believed that many CEOs suffered from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiot" about the rise of the personal computer, and he sat down with Jobs for over an hour, in which they had one of the rarest, most detailed conversations.
By this time, it had been over 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in Expert Idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing from the delivery.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the principal's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will hit theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to loathe long interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Four times during the interview, there are long pauses between question and answer -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes into play, when he seems impatient to respond to Cringley's questions, prompting him to respond more quickly to issues or side-acts of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, The Lost Interview seems kind of incredibly far-sighted, as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing that he thinks is right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read postmortem tributes to Jobs' career, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to greatness is something entirely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
And as soon as he did all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences from the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"In all my years in business, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
Nobody knows why he does what he does, and nobody in the business really thinks things through.
I've noticed that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs" that were quantified on a mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was charged:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed you to sneak into the telephone company and make long distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while scrambling through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff around the world half a dozen times, and if you were to ring the phone, it would come out a minute later on the phone next door", Jobs says, laughing.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, and that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be an Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to talk about a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost pulled when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night through the Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while doing their best to mimic Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope answered the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees".
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a little screen with a brown tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the argument going through the roof... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for 15 dollars, which was incredibly believable.
The big companies that are declining:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants would stumble with their visions and lose control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have a monopoly on the stock, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are they] the people who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products versus bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, you could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
You've suffered defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to memorize 5,000 things, these concepts, and put them all together...
At the end of the day, it's all about taste, it's all about trying to take the best stuff that people have ever made and then trying to put those things together into what you're making.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for the computer industry, they would be doing fantastic things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law opponents as court takes a case
On the day the Supreme Court convenes behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that will be representing the case in court.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing, and in fact, a 5 1/2 hour debate on the constitution is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing when the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand up in court and argue that the law is flippable will likely be Paul Clement, former attorney general under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that are challenging the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the trial.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court heard the case at a Washington hotel.
The report also highlights the need to ensure that the European Union's health policy is properly coordinated with the Member States.
The guests at the dinner?
The two judges have been attending the Federalist Society for years.
And that's not against moral standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: 'A judge may attend benefit events of law associations and other organizations, but the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or guest of such events.'
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing break with morality and code of conduct belies the claims of some judges, and the court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined at a benefit with lawyers with pending court cases".
Your appearance and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they are blending court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
But the conservatives are saying it's Justice Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to trial.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case on the grounds of bias, as she was too committed to the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan has no intention of doing this.
Boeing to land record $ 18 trillion order
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-engined aircraft with an option for 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It's really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 of their products.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 planes is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Emirates Airlines out of Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air said it had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is over a trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, a stock market analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines because that's one of their biggest cost points, is not so bad because the country is making money off of a higher oil price.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural safety net", he said.
The order from Emirates reinforces Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is challenging its A350 dominance.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 to compete directly with the 777-300ER.
The launch was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares are up 1.5% to $ 67.94.
The president's sister seems to be losing the election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have backed PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister has apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for governor in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... They occupied polling stations, set up roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]".
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who was leading in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), who is currently the incumbent governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and unfortunate left-wing leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital Morelia, denies any ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It's the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed during a campaign for Luisa Maria Calderon a week before the election and many candidates have dropped out of the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the election in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look forward to next year with courage".
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "passionlessly" at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful", he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune".
"So if China and India can help, they will do so by any means necessary".
The European Monetary Union has been in a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The looming severe debt crisis in Europe has fuelled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and dry foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else will we find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies like India have no incentive to help the wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom more than 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"Someday they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on beach holidays.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's large and well-paid civil servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/ now threatens "the risk of downgrading" due to the looming threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital.
The Pentagon 's urgent warning of possible defense cuts .
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress Monday that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon to the war zones in Afghanistan and civilian supply lines.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which would lead to what he called a foreclosure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would render most of our shipbuilding projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily withdraw a large proportion of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians behind with a near certainty to achieve the objective".
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness".
The cuts would ultimately hit the combat troops", said Panetta.
"While the wartime counterterrorism contingents are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", warned Panetta.
"Personnel recruitment has been cut, which would lead to delays in recruitment and recruitment oversight supporting the war".
"Personnel salaries would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime dealers and legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would begin a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are vehemently against this draconian act", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be forced on us".
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to occur".
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure for a compromise on the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about potential cuts, despite having many years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House before he came to the Pentagon, and he knows he's facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what could come - a shell-based but no-core military.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without ammunition".
"It's an air force squadron with no adequately trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission", Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to cope with potential adversaries".
"She actually makes you angry".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations on our global capability to operate and respond, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle needed by the Army and Navy to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F-35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step in the rearmament process so that potential threats from China and other adversaries can be eliminated.
How to Uncover a Lie
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lying are in our daily lives.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with sexual harassment allegations from several women, both sides accusing each other of lying.
Penn State officials are facing charges of perjury for allegedly withholding reports of a retired football coach sexually abusing a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was heard over an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton set off when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories of cheating in school and college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students the answers to the examinations so that they themselves would do well on their own performance checks.
Mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we witnessing?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
But many of these lies are considered to be necessity lies.
Another study found that strangers lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lying is something that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game, such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Have a good time", the disguise of deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush and flap.
But this does not mean that these liars are hard to uncover and expose.
A skilled lie detector can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the assertion, the subtle facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I've spent several years studying the scientific findings of the vast and ever-growing field of deception, and it's clear that deception deception is a modern skill that's easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing is one of your professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at evaluating other people, getting their interest, and controlling their own emotions.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more self-centered lies than women, whose lies are more "other-centered" - usually to protect others' feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know when someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
It's called baseline, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the quality of their voice.
You should know better when someone usually keeps kicking so that you don't wrongly accuse them of kicking during a meeting.
Then watch for accumulations of noticeable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Think of these clumps as alarm bells that are squealing, not as evidence of disguise.
People who cheat may freeze up when they try to remember their story, they may point their feet toward the door or lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "post-interview relaxation", that deep, relaxing exhalation and change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Interviewers often mistakenly signal that a job interview is over, only to find that relaxation after the job interview.
Also, watch your subject's language.
Scott Peterson's runaway is famous for using the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive, triggering a national manhunt.
Deceivers may also use distant language, such as "I did not have a sexual relationship with this woman, Miss Lewinsky", or repeating a tricky question in its entirety.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience".
This makes the response perceptual rather than objective, often sounding the alarm.
There is no magic cure for unmasking lies, but you can learn skills that make unmasking possible.
These skills can help you to reduce the risk of being a victim of fraud in your personal and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan revised after US approval delayed
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering unions and reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline company is trying to re-plan the project so it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will divert the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different route.
This came after the State Department announced last week that it would delay a decision on federal approval of the project until it had reviewed the new possible course, which would bypass the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater reservoir.
"This is a real step forward", Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year's election, even though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department matter and he pledged his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but labor markets love it, because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, opposed to the plan, are weighing the laws to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's recent environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy source says the State Department's chief auditor requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a seizure in the lobby of her Manhattan apartment building that scared her little girl so much that she threw up in fear.
The Lady Marmalade singer's tirade so frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10th of last year when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk, carrying the luggage and Genevieve on her arm, walked into the lobby of her Riverside Boulevard building.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to pick her up again", she said.
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman angrily.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or think".
She got angry and started yelling - she used the F word and the A word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be held back by her escort and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so hard, she said, it had to vomit.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote to apologize, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for comment.
The lawsuit is for undisclosed damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he doesn't charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they receive to childhood cancer charities.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby".
Climate change is holding back the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, Sinaloa saw unemployment and undeclared work rise, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, was in government.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in losses in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and caused an overall decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first quarter, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16%, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent was partially destroyed, mainly vegetable, maize and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican state.The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, which is equivalent to 4.53 percent of the working population.In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa.This is 18,969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors: economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Universidad Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is due to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the cuts in funding from the anti-money laundering legislation passed by Congress, because it is not easy for those who illegally accumulate dollars to make them work for them, invest them or use them for anything else", he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country to look for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is partly due to the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult to find work there too.
Unpaid work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38% of the country's employed who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are also associated with low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labor and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September; this is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade, with the Secretaría de Economía (state economic agency) reporting that FDI from January to June was $630,597, down 87.74 percent from $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Economic Development Office) for its part recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos from the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to revive the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community, the first year of Mario López Valdés's government made it obvious that he was incapable of governing.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no effort was made in 2011 to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year. It is necessary to work hard to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of everyone and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated", he explained.
Slow economic growth
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freeze.One of the main effects is a slowing economy that is not moving sufficiently to generate an economic momentum that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Redefining the term 'appellation'
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Confederation of Employers) in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to be made more dynamic in productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done.We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he said.
There's a lot to do.
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas.
He stressed that the current government had made progress in the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead", he said.
Arrested for eight kilos of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of probation for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of an offence against public health - in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of trade.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military officers while guarding Cipriano Valdez Street opposite guard post 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
As a result, the seized goods were handed over to the district judge and the prisoner remains in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social housing projects for migrants under the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed or of being delayed by a lack of funds, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the city's social development authority explained that although the construction programs have already progressed, they are now in jeopardy because the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent was paid by the state, and so far only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, so a delay in completion is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is almost over, they haven't given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July", he said.
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, and that the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of his term, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have borrowed.
"We had already been in this situation in the last parliamentary term because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, the programmes continued and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes", he said.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is almost over, they haven't given us a penny".
The court approves the switch to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The switchover from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which requires the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes needed to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the switch to digital terrestrial television.
The decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not obtain the necessary qualified majority of eight votes for the court to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality.
The draft lawsuit, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) is responsible for regulating radio and television, and the decree would therefore be contrary to hierarchical principles and legal requirements.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree-law, which, after the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero stopped applying the decree-law and stopped all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Land government could not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general regulations.
"I also do not believe that doing so would undermine the independence of the regulatory body", she said, noting that the central government is constitutionally responsible for planning strategic policy areas such as the telecommunications sector, as it directs national affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes that has taken place in the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, improved signal quality and more channels.
The Commission's proposal to introduce a new system for the exchange of information on the European Union's external relations is a step in the right direction.
These matters, she stressed, "require the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they contain a set of features that place the constitution in the hands of the central government".
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition through government, despite having highly specialized institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government interfered with the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected", she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor election is almost 27 percent, with 879 out of a total of 6074 votes still to be counted.
The possibility of single counting of ballots is a reality in this year's elections in Michoacán, as the difference between first and second place in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent, according to data released by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), with 879 out of a total of 6074 votes still to be counted.
In this context, the President of the General Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that on 9 November the electoral authority had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted its political constitution, its electoral law or its electoral justice law to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they did not come into force in this election round.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, declaring the vote of the State Commissioner on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because the latter does not have the right to "decide or veto it".
In an interview on the possibility of single counting, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM would allow the local electoral authority to count the ballots partially or completely.
The results of the votes in the minutes are not the same; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not in the file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of completed ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the runner-up of less than one per cent, provided that the party or coalition leader who is the second of the candidates mentioned makes an explicit request at the beginning of the meeting.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after the final counting, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one per cent, provided that a representative of the party whose candidate came second has expressly requested this.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral minutes have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés crashed on Sunday night in Saltillo, his birthplace, and a memorial service was held Monday.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a memorial service, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the other victims of the crash of a Mexican Air Force plane, and those closest to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed in the funeral hall on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, a memorial service organized by his former high school classmates and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio was a member of while preparing for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, as he had always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams and she feels that he was in the prime of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to enter the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it because they thought he would get dizzy even on a truck.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good man: "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán for the graduation of a family member, so he knows that his uncle died while doing what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A final farewell
The honor was bestowed upon him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Region, the Mexican Air Force, the headmaster and student of the Technological Educational Institute of Saltillo, where he graduated in 1985 and excelled in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying crashed, carrying Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other officials from the same agency.
At 18:05 the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, by the funeral company in the front square of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land on Cadereyta NL.
Hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found shot in different parts of their bodies and killed by a single gunshot in an abandoned ranch in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident took place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, high above the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, open wide.
When they looked inside, they found the bodies of three people about ten feet [3 m] away, and they immediately reported this to the authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, no shoes on; another was lying beside him, wearing a white top.
About a foot away was the body of another person in a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information we received at the scene, the three people must have been killed in another location, since no shell casings were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse, you can read the inscriptions that one organized gang of criminals writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) identified 11 individuals, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang that operated mainly in the town of Cadereyta and are linked to kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and the men arrested confirmed they were members of the criminal group Los Zetas.
On November 12 at 06:00 military officers on patrol in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, found a car with no license plate and two occupants.
When the military inspected the vehicle, they found a long gun, a magazine and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on November 13 at 2 pm, one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee when he saw the military.
They're being charged with secret burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The new Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present him with the new government to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The new Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present him with the new government to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president of the country, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's foreign policy is implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the European Union.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times", the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments suggest that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well fixed", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to unbearable levels.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European politicians to restore the battered confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to act quickly was compounded by the volatile market situation, which has led to the imposition of a 7% interest rate on Italian government bonds for 10 years, similar to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Confindustria, the Italian industry association, told the press after meeting Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our might".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Montis' chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which resigned on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are aimed at achieving good results", said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government made up of mostly technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delay in reforms could again trigger a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also pressing the issue by saying that a failure of Montis would be a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The Commission is now in the process of adopting a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits due to uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next election, expected in 2013, despite predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms rather than prefer elections.
Monti said he would like to have politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist it should be technicians only, a sign of their concerns about the process imposed by financial market pressure.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties make it difficult to involve people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to gamble than Ticos
Of the 22 players recalled from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games to play.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 recruits has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which will be played at 15:05 today at the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, can look back on a considerable number of A-League selections, the three-color team only has defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international appearances.
He achieved this number last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs in the English Premier League have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup competitions) and high-level European cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Fury in complicated Eurocup and World Cup qualifiers.
The Tico players, on the other hand, have few international matches in the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 games abroad, reached a draw with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the tri-color team today and Spain will set a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a player for Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a UEFA recognition last week, along with others in the Iberian team who had reached the magic number of 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
The number of 100 is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fabregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
On the Ticos side, close to Michael Umana, are left-sided striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came in over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
The Spanish team has played less than 30 games, with Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national team side, Roy Miller with 26 and 26 are coming in. Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them aren't even close to the 20-year mark.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has recorded only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary.
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is prepared to play one of their best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They've been waiting for over 20 years, but the band assures them that playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This was confirmed by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is on the South American leg of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the interview, which is available in full in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, Pearl Jam playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true: do you realize what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for vacation. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted to the days leading up to the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being there for us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a little pressure on you from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they've made us ready for this gig in Costa Rica.
Really, we're in the mood to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing, and we love the jungle, and Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for that.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf waves?
A lot of our friends are surfers, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends used to go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and along with Mexico, they're great places to surf, and that's how we learned about people who love surfing.
Looking back on the tour, you guys put on some big shows with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
We've never played there before, so we don't have any limits.
We're going to try to put on the best show we can with a lot of different songs, and we want to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everybody likes a different song, so it's not easy to decide which one we're going to play.
If we add two or three songs that we haven't played in a while to our repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked those songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and I think it makes it more interesting for the audience.
This tour is your 20th anniversary.
Looking back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We continue to count on this blessing and are thrilled to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and we're passionate about making music.
We're lucky to be able to go to the places in the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to be an active participant in the birth of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band comes out of a city, but it is quite unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're still excited to be friends with all of them and honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It's also very unusual for a band like yours to stay with the same musicians for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt [Cameron] joined us 13 years ago, which alone is way longer than most bands last.
First of all, I think we all consider ourselves lucky to be alive and also we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other and their music.
Your relationship with fame wasn't always easy, but on the other hand, your success allowed you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure we don't go on tour too much, because it's too easy to get caught up in this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought to life, not obsess about being a famous rock star.
What are your memories of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for three years, never released a record until Andy's death.
We were disappointed that it took so long, and we're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think about what an amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yeah, the production team sent us videos of several bands and we liked this band the best, so we're curious to see what Las Robertas has to offer live.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed, I have no idea.
He's singing it, and I think he's singing the first thing that comes to mind.
Who was your bass player?
Of so many
Some of the first people I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them, I could spend the whole afternoon talking about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive even though it's no longer a fad?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, and if they're still relevant today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever before.
Her music was darker at first, now it's more positive.
Why? Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive about them.
I was both moved to tears when I heard Ed play it.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happens in your life, like losing a family member or a friend, it affects your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be examined for muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations during his time in office (1990-2000), has several health problems, including tongue cancer, which he has had four operations and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori was being examined for three days at Peru's Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas hospital to determine the cause of his pain and the loss of muscles in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but he did not want to do so because he believed he was innocent.
He had four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 40 pounds [18 kg], and had other medical problems, including severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in the custody of the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's death squad, which operated underground during his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and comprising several ministers and businessmen will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, which the Uruguayan president says will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan community in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support over the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which still act as tax havens.
Mexico has been the chair of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries.
The Uruguay government has in recent years sought to accelerate the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the OECD's 'grey list' of countries that have not adopted all international standards for tax cooperation.
On the commercial side, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004 and has contributed to an increase in trade between the two countries.
The mustachioed plumber enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which will hit stores around the world this month, was designed from the outset to match the features of the Ninth 3DS handheld console, which allows for 3D play without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses", said Omar Álvarez, the head of Nintendo's press in Spain, at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed from the ground up for this console" because until now, successful titles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman emphasized that although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast, fluid play.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
Afterwards, the experts can play a "second round" of the various levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
The gameplay is also very simple, with the user being able to choose between an aggressive D or one that only affects the depth of the action, but the gameplay must always be three-dimensional to overcome the obstacles without falling victim to the visual effects.
This trip of Super Mario to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo is winking at fans of the saga and repeating the recipe for success of the last issues: the mustachioed installer must overcome platforms full of dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters new moves, environments, costumes, enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillos to the United States
Guatemala's President, Álvaro Colom, announced on Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to face charges in the United States for conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process of the US request for the extradition of Portillo so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, given that an ordering court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he did not interfere in court decisions and that he had granted all extradition requests brought to his attention.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being extradited for murder and aggravated assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colom action is a governmental act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional means to convict the former President of the State (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling 120 million quetzal at the Ministry of Defense during his administration, a trial that preceded extradition, but the minister appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social aid organisation have produced important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday at the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems and at risk of being marginalized.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday was attended by many officials from institutions that have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different political orientations in election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and then left-green city councillor Ricard Goma attended the celebrations.
The great Fabra i Coats hall was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work Department of the La Caixa Savings Bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was set up in very difficult times and that the times are no less complicated today, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The President of the Generalitat sees Trinijove as a role model who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does", he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Rue Balmes, Barcelona.
The 12 squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house at number 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying yesterday at noon, where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be controlled", the manager confirmed.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were occupied - took all the electrical equipment and some of the water supply, painted the walls, and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held on the three lower floors, lasting up to two days, driving tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the occupation began.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the occupants were unfairly competing, as they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the disco.
The owner of the club had also been reported by neighbours for disturbing the peace, while according to her the noise was not from the visitors to the disco but from the occupants and especially from the guests of the parties that were organized there, which according to the angry neighbours had become more and more prolonged in recent weeks.
The manager of the disco explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the building owner not to pay rent for the past nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be evacuated immediately and for the problems of civil coexistence and the decline of the district to be taken care of.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the past few months the squatters had entered all floors of the building and almost all apartments.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to crack down on the antisocial acts in the building".
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 Montréal Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to break into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, aside from the disputes over the fees.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its defamation of the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became again the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone, with wild boars playing the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the case when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for additional gates to Collserola.
No doubt a gate is a nod to the concept of a park.
Either that or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question is obvious: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for tenders is the talk of all Barcelona architects, not only from an organisational point of view but also in terms of reflection on the city.
It's almost a recurring theme for two members of this old-fashioned caste who meet in the elevator.
And it is this very fact that provides the material for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, it is "necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountain" if the speech of Ildefons Cerda about the green apples has not been delivered.
"It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
One of the reasons is that it's easy to access.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" is a "lexical trap": they must not be "considered as entrances to a park, but as boundaries of areas to be acted upon".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, who have experience in urban planning, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The Committee of the Regions believes that the European Parliament should be given the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the future of the European Parliament.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster".
Modol, who is more specific, says that the Collserola side, which runs towards Vallesana, "cannot be understood as a park that does not run towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola which should not "go unnoticed", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the mountain's proximity to the city is the guide that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" that this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams set up ("just the right one", he says) "We architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since the tender conditions do not give a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-sectional tenders", he says, "on the mountain-sea axis.
This has, in his case at least, led to him taking part in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and definition of a gate project would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next door.
He felt that it was essential for the city to ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt was designed along its entire length to provide a smooth transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal, who is released
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red's representative has cleared the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the charges of alleged extortion.
After 72 days in custody, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Casino Red pardoned him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is prosecuting the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money to get the city to approve the secret operation of the casino.
Following the criminal complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panista mayor, who was detained for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the official of the Ministerio Público dismissed the charges of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta Prison for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but he only stayed in the medium security zone for a few hours because of death threats.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was served with a warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who found that after nearly two months of investigation, there was enough evidence to convict Jonas of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, the commissioner of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to commute the sentence, and he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, an official of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to the court, asked García Gómez if he had repaired the damage and which of the bookmaker's owners had pardoned him.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and there are no further appeals and no claims for damages.
After the bookie's representative was questioned at about 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Breton was released immediately.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been acquitted and that his case was being filed.
He also informed him of the court order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) of Mexico informed that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people indicate that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, crashed directly into the ground without the pilot being able to make an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome,secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight before takeoff.
"The fact that the propeller wings made contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts".
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers and therefore fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that the examinations in the area where the plane landed did not find any helicopter parts.
"The search found no aircraft parts in other locations, the impact was on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers and therefore met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
The priority now is to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat of Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial was travelling at cruising speed when it hit and the aircraft had fallen to a soft slope.
'This information supports the belief that this was a normal flight operation at the time of impact.'
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
I 'm on the ground .
In accordance with flight regulations, this was a flight under the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded favorable weather conditions at the time of launch, and some low-hanging clouds formed during the flight toward the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Location of impact:
The impact coordinates and the helicopter's last radar record match, and there may have been no loss of control of the aircraft or deviation from the flight path prior to the impact.
Dispersion of the aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was struck from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter was struck by the ground with its structure intact.
No sign of fire or explosion.
The remains of the plane at the crash site suggest neither fire nor explosion.
The latest results indicate multiple ground contacts.
The on-site investigation found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is steep and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter probably broke down.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the crash site's restricted area, no scattered aircraft parts were found, reinforcing the belief that the intact aircraft structure had impacted the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, entitled "Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity", to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit (Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, and those interested can come to the IMSS sports fields in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on children and adolescents every Saturday from 8 a.m. onwards.
He stressed that the investigation started at Cuauhtémoc stadium in the west of Mexico and has been ongoing since 8 October at Nezahualcóyolt stadium in the east of Mexico.
Once the target of 500 to 600 subjects has been reached, the study will continue at the Independencia sports ground (south of the capital district) and conclude at the Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for chronic degenerative diseases in Mexican children and adolescents.
On World Diabetes Day, he said the aim was for 3,000 children and adolescents aged six to 14 to complete nutrition questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also said that on the Saturdays mentioned, subjects would be measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure checked, and blood values such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study was being carried out in response to healthcare workers' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the percentage of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent, and overweight has also increased dramatically", the IMSS specialist stressed.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population is different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he explained, the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn off excess energy (calories) that we take in, so that it is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children to determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even look for dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of pre-diabetes and metabolic disorders.
All information would be kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors, who would explain all the results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes that would be appropriate to prevent illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that contribute to obesity, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using transportation instead of walking.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake, and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM, has developed polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature changes.
If the signs from the pavement were heeded, the need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes would not be needed when the rainy season begins in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, assuring that if the asphalt was properly laid and maintained, the number of potholes would be greatly reduced or even avoided.
In his lecture on "Hot Potholes from a Technical Point of View", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is in charge of is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the pavement and thus prevent the appearance of potholes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low molecular weight - the so-called malthenes.
The elasticity of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, is very tough at 120°C and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the strength of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes on a given day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations", explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City have a flexible pavement composed of six layers of material, the last three of which include asphalt.
Between the top layers is a layer of asphalt, made up of small stones that have been bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles are moving on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the pavement.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even more distributed", said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer", he explained, "a final layer is laid, the so-called carry layer, which is made of tiny stones, i.e., sand that has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must produce friction.
This pavement receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs to be of an appropriate thickness and the material of which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature variations, are other important factors to consider, especially water", he said, "because it significantly affects the wear layer's behaviour.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and only with difficulty comes out, causing all layers of the pavement to soften and, as a result, potholes to form.
"When a hole is created", he said, "the first thing that happens is that the roof layer wears off, and then the wear layer is affected, but the damage is not immediate, but a process that would have to be maintained at the first sign of damage by appropriate maintenance programs".
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico's National Research System) explained that vehicle load is another important cause of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and that this rule must be ensured to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that much research was still to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and which allow the potholes to be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the del Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not being crowned Miss Colombia.
El Valle wins his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty at the Miss Colombia pageant.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
The result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, brings the Department to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands.
The big question many people ask today is, what was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not for nothing she had been chosen by Vogue as the Queen of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie, titles that had also been awarded to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that was considered decisive for the jury's decision to nominate her as First Miss was that she was not convinced by the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the most and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilization, and ultimately I think the book that has most influenced my childhood is The Little Prince, a very profound book.
I'm currently reading Guilt and Atonement, a book of universal culture that we should all read, and I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called Passions.
A response that met with little resistance, first because of the term 'civilizing' and second because she had not explicitly explained how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all of you, please read The Little Prince.
Among other things, it's said that El Valle's favorite has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite, the one who received the most applause and had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy competition, audience vote for the best handmade costume and Reina Madre) "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage".
And you saw that on her first show in a bathing suit on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and her two elevators at the coronation.
Although she performed with confidence in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN program "Como en casa", said that Melina's being crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not become queen after all".
And Valle ended up avoiding the press, which was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
There must be a reason why, two days before the international jury was to meet, Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social issues of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sensation, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before she entered the competition", she explained.
It's also been speculated that Valle had sinned with her derriere defects and the fibrosis that was noted in her stomach area, but that's contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was no better, "but her problem with the abdominal fibrosis, which to be honest, was hardly noticeable to me, depressed her score on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine feels that the Valle del Cauca woman's mistake was the surgery she had undergone.
"The surgeries are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body was never her strong point, and this job had to pay".
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, after the performance in the bathing suit, a cruel prediction was made that was to come true at night.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is entering her year of reign today, not as queen, but as princess, a position that will allow her to represent Colombia in one of the international beauty pageants upon nomination.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her stunning performance for Cartagena, missed the crown.
That was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A California lophoscopist went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a loboscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) in Cali entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, was on call.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó communities, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the location of the bodies he was to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses, he specialised in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the surfaces of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
He was on a helicopter from Palmyra to Cauca Friday night.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who had led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was told to take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived at the location of the body with the examiner's aid, he could not identify the body because of its physical appearance, which bore no resemblance to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local peasant, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints are not lies.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the body's fingerprints with those found on the print sheet.
He saw it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That very night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
In Search of Traces
The award given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" was very important for a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, but they also assist in the investigation of murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of those arrested.
When arrested, many criminals present false identity papers or do not have any.
We'll pull their prints and run them through the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of a wall out of a house during a burglary because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this very spot when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or charge murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suggested that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is involved, it does link him to the place where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscopist at the CTI explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object by chemical or physical reagents".
If they appear, a plant cell or tape is used to carry them away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the personnel office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers", the CTI expert explained.
He said that not everything was as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The "outraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents in the Zuccotti Square.
Many complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday as they tried again to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being evicted from the square at dawn and attempting to occupy another plaza in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square, seeking to gain access to a court order allowing "outraged" people to pitch tents again, while another section of the movement followed the evacuation order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp out in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle with legal means to get back to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray noted that the "outraged" response to the evacuation of their tent camp, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, went all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to pitch tents.
The "outraged" also occupied a new park, located at the intersection of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers.
The organization claims that hundreds of people gathered at the site, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived to show their support for the movement's members and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a privately owned area) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to examine the legality of the early morning eviction.
Some of the protesters who were driven from the square carried photocopies of the court order and distributed them, even giving them to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes", Bray reported, indicating that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members from the square and from applying "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg explained to the press that the court order had stopped the reopening of the square for public transport and demonstrators, and that city laws did not allow them to re-set up tents and sleeping bags in the square.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, which led to the arrest of nearly 200 people, and was decided because the protesters "were violating the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the evacuation because the square had "become a place where people come not to demonstrate but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses have received threats" and residents fear "for their quality of life".
"The early morning eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers", the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "failing to respect press freedom".
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing "big actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests that have been ongoing since Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the Christmas TV show
She will be performing with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", a bunny on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model is going to be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson will be performing alongside crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathing life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage of the television program in which Anderson - who also contributed to the Internet distribution of a self-made porn in which she appears with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee - portrays the Virgin Mary holding a doll that is said to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as a Jesus child.
CTV's Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March and is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the free-fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster Japan had seen since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be fading despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of falling, the figures for July to September finally serve to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% on the year-on-year rate.
The second quarter, which starts in March 2012, is also the fastest growth since January-March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, firms increased their investment by 1.1% compared with the 0.9% decrease in capital investment recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses to use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been particularly prominent thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of its GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by rising expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has turned to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy outlook for the U.S., a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy relies on the health of the big technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak operating results from July to September to the yen's appreciation.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must be aware of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points in the world economy, showed that the brakes had been pulled on the major economic powers.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average of 100, having fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries soaring and uncertainty spreading, Greece is still straying further into the maze leading out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October", Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform civil servants' disciplinary procedures and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not remove any doubt about his position: "We have committed to support the transitional government, but nothing else".
The conservative leader went too far in his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that must unlock the 8 billion Athens desperately needs, making it clear that he would not approve any commitment to implement austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the repercussions of the Papandreou referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demands should not be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Economy Ministry, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth tranche" of €8 billion, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot has a few strings left.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the 'dominant' position of Spain in this type of financing.
Spain "has achieved a world-leading position in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that over the past two decades Spain has become the world's second largest donor of this instrument for international cooperation, whose "essence" lies in its being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on Microfinance in Valladolid, convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business was "absolutely essential" to reach the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of reducing the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, below the "poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to extend the network of beneficiaries "to the ends of the earth and it is carrying out this task responsibly", Queen Sofia noted, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will emerge from the summit, which runs until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "we face many challenges".
The Microfinance Summit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform for the promotion of 'two fundamental objectives'.
The Queen stated that the aim is to have 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will be above the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path "initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia described as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the founder of the fund as an "admirable idealist committed to fighting poverty" whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this context, she stressed that it was a mistake to link development aid to economic booms, as it was a 'lasting commitment'.
Jiménez said that microcredit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the developed countries now "more than ever" needed to work on solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be sacrificed to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the 'most important forms of development aid'.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who are always behind closed doors", and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opens "its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes that the EU president be elected by universal suffrage
The first day of the CDU Congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was a smooth one for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally included in the programme but has prevailed in the autumn, particularly to satisfy those activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The Presidency's proposal for the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The three pro-European finance ministers gave a standing ovation for several minutes, which was attributed to the intervention of Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the request - is the following: the answer to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.
The Chancellor said the time had come for a breakthrough in Europe.
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a universal vote, 'to give Europe a face'.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It is certainly unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree to this revolution: Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone has been reached.
The delegates also overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB's Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is keen to calm the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced her references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has stopped trying to win her Congress at the expense of the 'small' or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European proposal devotes a paragraph to the importance of 'German-French friendship', Angela Merkel does not call France to the table.
At least not directly.
Because this is a reminder that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is the meaning of sick leave fraud?
After the family allowances, the UMP and the government are now tackling the sickness report.
Mr Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family benefit fund and deliver a speech on the recurring theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
To accompany this attack, which is intended to put the economy to the test but which on the other hand is no less a harbinger of a right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' sick leave.
The government is aiming to introduce a fourth day of quarantine before taking into account a sickness report for private sector workers.
In plain English, this means that a sick worker would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly earnings, without the specific company's permission.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the granting of aid for the construction of a new railway line in the north of the country.
The Commission has also proposed a new measure to improve the quality of the healthcare system, which would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic nature: granting civil servants an unpaid day's sick leave (unlike the three days in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority is also reigniting the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will be reimbursable if they are required", warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, in front of the microphone of RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report seems somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent activity in the field of sickness reports.
The Commission has already been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of political offensives which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no more often sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
But first let us look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And that means 2.5% health care spending.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
A mean that masks some differences: another, published in 2007 by career planning website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had never taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time by the Health Insurance Institute, shows that 37% of the cases reported in 2010 were of less than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days; 15% were between 15 days and one month; 15% were between one and three months; and 11% were over.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are therefore not more likely to be disabled than elsewhere.
A longterm study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (due to illness or otherwise) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave accounts for a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that systematic checks are now available for sickness reports exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for the Training and Development of Technicians and Engineers) found that, among 1.5 million checks, 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports received, or 37,050, were 'unjustified or too long'.
Of the systematically controlled cases of sickness reported over 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million were 'inappropriate or unjustified', or 132,000.
This means that there are 169,000 'unjustified' cases for every several million workers who have claimed sickness.
This figure is only a small fraction of, say, the figure for black labour.
According to Dominique Tian, a UMP member who wrote a report on the issue in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in lost tax revenues per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances and thus much more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's foreign policy is implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the European Union.
'To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme,' the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The EU's foreign policy is to be based on the principle of subsidiarity, which is the principle of subsidiarity.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by '9%' of GDP by the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new savings withdrawals
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing, had on Monday given his approval to the already approved measures for an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but had indicated that his party would not agree to an additional savings cut.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He had agreed to the reduction of budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, had told Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, says a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together on pain management to provide the best pain relief, even beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of disciplines, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow for assisted suicide and euthanasia where this option is available, in patients deemed capable of making such a decision.
To start, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU that compared the death rate in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death".
Medical care or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain medication, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6 percent of them end up dying in a hospital.
In the whole country, Quebec has the highest rate of hospital deaths at 86%.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council on the subject of the use of the death penalty in the case of euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts who have examined all the countries which have legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are found in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, a co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday on a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Associated suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in Support of Euthanasia
Consider that according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians were already in favor of euthanasia, believing that it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
For those who have already committed an assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or stopping the drugs in patients, the situation is less clear, the report's authors say.
The Commission also suggests in its list of recommendations that the Criminal Code should specify that the withdrawal of funds for which a valid refusal has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The expert group also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life withdrawal without fear of prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together on pain management to provide the best pain relief, even beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, the panel calls for at least consideration of pain relief or end-of-life measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, since they did not reduce physical pain as much as euthanasia and they are related to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the attitude of the experts who signed the report as 'extreme', in part because they put no limits on the practice of euthanasia in end-stage patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years old can ask another person to help him commit suicide", said RA Deschamps, who yesterday read a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place individual self-responsibility above all other values involved in the social activities of society.
But, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed 'strong opposition' to the report's conclusions, which she called 'the pro-euthanasia manifesto'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly skeptical of reports of no abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls for President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy" against the Syrian government
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the authorities of the Foreign Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who is however resisting it with the support of Russia and denying a 'plot' against the country, intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League excluded Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions on Damascus despite the fact that Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the Arab prime minister who yesterday called on President Bashar al-Assad to 'put down his government in Syria', in which some 40 civilians and members of the government have already been killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interests, he would step down, but he should also create the conditions for a new era of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that Turkish mediation efforts against the Syrian regime had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
He said that the EU had to be prepared to take on the challenge of the crisis and that the EU had to be prepared to take on the challenge of the crisis.
The United States, for its part, condemned the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly harsh stance in the face of the repression in Syria", observes Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 government forces have been killed in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed in "shootings and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless said that the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly condemned the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he called a "dangerous step".
He added that Syria "will not give in", and that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a 'protection mechanism for civilians' and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he described as "paranoid".
The League is due to hold an extraordinary meeting tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to end the crisis agreed on 2 November, in particular the controversial withdrawal of military forces from besieged towns and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" to guard against supporting any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the exit plan.
The Commission
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian Prime Minister, has asked the markets for a little more time to put together his staff and implement a programme that will "surrender" to regain the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is composed of relatively strict external technocrats.
'Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,' said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, which calls for the EU to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
The agreement will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of candidates for cancellation, which will no doubt include a dozen ministers and the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti said yesterday's nervousness in the stock and bond markets was taking its toll.
He stressed that 'in a democracy there are certain deadlines' for preparing a government and a government programme, noting that 'it is certain that markets will be patient and sensible'.
The President's order was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The current Prime Minister was to set up a staff of mostly technocrats, although he had stressed that he was willing to include 'politicians'.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Since taking office, Mr Monti has been committed to working as urgently as possible to make Italy a 'new protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that 'our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even with the new government in place'.
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans launched in recent months, has in particular called for new hardline measures.
The Commission's proposal to set up a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is a step in the right direction.
Known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), Mr Monti represents a 'change of epoch' for Italy after 17 years of 'Berlusconism'; the 'professor' symbolizes the 'challenge of trustworthiness' and a 'different Italy', according to the editors.
The big unknown here is the durability of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to raise 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based its findings on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency investigating this scientist.
The IAEA had expressed its "serious concern" last week about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Urals, since the early 1960s, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces 'nano-diamonds'.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned 'strong evidence that Iran's development of a nuclear explosive system'was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly proficient in this technology but who, as one member of the Agency stated, had spent his entire professional career working directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his home country on this technology, which is essential.'
Anti-Islamic crimes and delinquencies have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims increased by 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims increased by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, while there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences globally.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose to 6,628 in a very small way, including 47.3% of racially and 20% of religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and offences rising again", Human Rights First stressed.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", added Paul Legendre, a senior human rights official.
"The US government can and should do more to combat these abuses", he added, believing that this could be done by improving the police's attitude to 'hate crimes'.
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the Civil Rights era in American federal law.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence against race, color, religion or ethnicity, and now includes crimes of sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing the platform and becoming more and more like Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to Facebook.
The new Activity tab and a new Name feature make it easier to read live the activities of other Twitter users, the Internet users whose messages you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to see if they allow you to follow their news, subscribe to new posts, favour certain news, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested on a small percentage of users before its general Internet launch on Monday "in August", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its less instinctive functioning, with a somewhat esoteric-looking texture (RT for referenced repetition of another person's post).
The network's users debated this innovation via specific tweets on the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me to better track certain elements of my stream", tweeted @dannykronstrom.
The Commission
The Constitution introduces a 'golden rule' for the budget
The government of the major Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies to Austria's top rating (AAA).
It was the Socialist Chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+ in a single stroke, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year", argued Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria is also complying with a demand made by the Brussels summit of euro area Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had demanded that the reduction of public deficits be included in the constitution by the end of 2012 and that the public balance be restored or that an equivalent law be passed.
The Austrian government's action is similar to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a 'rule' into its constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of GDP each year, from 2017 onwards the structural budget deficit of the federal state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP threshold, while the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
The strong yen
Noda threatens to intervene again in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time", Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was back near the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold off massive yen against dollars to devalue the Japanese currency, which is on track to hit a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen steadily above this, driven by purchases by investors who see the yen as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen bar near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports by raising the cost of 'made in Japan' products and reducing the value of income drawn by Japanese firms from abroad, as they exchange it into local currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region", stresses M. Noda, who fears that the yen's rise could kill the weak recovery in the first place.
The third-largest economy in the world has gained momentum for the first time this year, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - thanks to the surge in exports and consumption of households hit by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, feels that the yen's appreciation does not reflect 'the economic foundations of Japan'.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Bank, informed the BoJ that it had already taken "appropriate measures", indicating that no further currency easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the central bank increased its purchases of government bonds by 5 trillion yen (€47 billion) to pay off the 55 trillion yen (€519 billion) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
Interest rates are soaring, stock markets are falling
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is continuously undermining European indicators.
Despite the new heads of government taking office in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates in the weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting into negative territory again this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, in London by 0.1%.
"As a result of new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets continue to release some of their recent gains.
"Capitalization is nervous and all too aware of the risk of contagion", says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which is suffering from renewed fears among market participants about the capacity of Europe to sustain the debt crisis, closed down 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade is moving in a limited corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is hurting the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it was down 0.4%.
According to stockbrokers, it has fallen after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which met at the congress on Monday, approved a proposal that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The rates in Italy and Spain are well below the 6% threshold.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while that on Spanish bonds matured at 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti asked the markets for more time to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was 'the main task' of his government.
Spain is in the grip of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are due to take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish ten-year bonds has once again reached a new historic high.
Expectations for growth in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded a 0.4% growth in the third quarter, supported by household consumption, which was slightly better than the 0.3% forecast.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE, however, had revised the fall in the second quarter's figures to a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economists.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first round of calculations for the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Triumph Over Dogma
If there is one issue which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotion, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Despite the fact that there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so that a huge proportion of the world's population will not have to miss out on a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity sustainably, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate variability.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
The Commission has therefore decided to continue to monitor the situation in the Community.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a substitutable alternative source, or in Switzerland, which is barely planning to build any more last-generation nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are still pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to add another unit to its nuclear power plant after Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
The German model of renewable energy is sometimes cited as a model, but the reality is that it is not.
The Berlin election will be reflected in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence, particularly on Russia, due to increased reliance on imported gas, and increased CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The Danish case is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is a European leader in wind energy, which provides 30% of its electricity, and a major user of coal and gas, alternating with wind power, which means that its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Since energy prices are a key competitive factor in a globalised economy and a guarantee of industrial stability on a national level, French companies have an advantage in having the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
The European Parliament has also been asked to draw up a report on the future of the European energy market.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industrial sector with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, most of these SMEs would be the victims and the annual EUR 6 billion of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to operate for 60 years if its manufacturer's decline is preprogrammed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no miracle cure for generating electricity, just as there is no miracle cure for creating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear and renewable energy are a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
The maintenance of the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a safety authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections at existing sites such as the construction site in Flamanville.
Their teams, which have made a name for themselves for their professionalism, are now obsessed with the idea of security.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, was operated under normal operating conditions, with no human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the tragedy was exacerbated by reactor design and unrelenting human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as it did from the two preceding ones.
The EPR is the result of this approach and of cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations.
As electrical engineers consider it desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a halt in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, giving them the opportunity to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party politics dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies with a policy that is subject to numbers, and its compatibility with the status of a "land of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had made the news, with the Interior Minister casually declaring (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need foreign talents, masons or waiters".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
On the right, the tone was taken by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that '900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country', and on the left by Michel Rocard, who said in 1990 that France 'cannot accommodate all the poverty in the world'.
The only difference is the degree of roughness
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both the right and the left.
Both sides saw immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of rudeness which one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande's programme is limited to banalities that suggest that partnership development will help solve our 'migration problems'.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the election, but it is costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages, and jobs in immigrant countries.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the EU's external relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are maintained.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workforce, especially the low-skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than native wage earners, as they focus less on occupations in sectors that are technically unused.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that are not attractive to local wage earners, while the more skilled immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched by the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants would produce a correlated long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average at around 1% of total budgets.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 makes a net contribution to the public budget (income minus expenditure) of about EUR 150,000 on average over his lifetime.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to combat fraud.
These teeth, which were meant to deter immigrants, did the opposite.
Europe has invented democracy, now it is time to rethink European democracy
Democracy is a valuable commodity; it is also a delicate commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had allowed the whole of the 20th century to pass over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonel in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon the Younger that it was a characteristic of the mind.
The universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and may well become an 'instrument of oppression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a judiciary.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change in attitude of the Greek referendum on truth and falsehood would have been of two kinds: first, the need for a strong return to politics, and secondly, the disturbing feeling of its impossibility and inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pushing for the success of the national referendum, which was organised according to needs and in the wrong order.
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is able to make its views known to the citizens of Europe.
We are not asking for a hatchet, but for a collective task, a legitimate, clear and steady one, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
The European Union is not a political entity, but it is a political entity.
The urgent need is to return the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
It is up to the whole of Europe to reduce the burden of their debt, to free themselves from the markets and to build a future through investment.
The way out of the crisis is to make decisions at European level, which cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to ruin.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
I'll take that.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it proposes to the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, the fact required the "creation" of republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must build a Europe which is more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
Contactless smart cards are becoming commonplace
The World Chip Fair opens its doors in Villepinte, near Paris, on Tuesday with optimism.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards, telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most prominent segment is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments after being behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings were rather modest, with only 400,000 contactless Visa cards being distributed.
But consumer markets are fading.
Carrefour therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a faster rate, it is now necessary for banks to provide these cards to their customers.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically issuing contactless-chipped bank cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step on the road to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A disproportionately small percentage of devices are currently equipped with the near field communication (NFC) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"You're behind on your pay".
"But they should see a real upward trend at least next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had yesterday announced the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be fitted with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirming themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Prime Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the relations between the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation", he said, without going into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January has revealed links.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were abducted by Aqmi supporters in a restaurant in Niamey, were reportedly killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of the recorded telephone calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two people: one number leads to a Nigerian who had been in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, for a long time; the other leads to a man believed to be linked to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"It is conceivable, though".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that they are increasingly active", mitigates Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these 'support services' have become more visible in their course, as have Boko Haram's addresses and modes of operation, which now point to the addition of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to address the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati who do not need special attention.
Successful
Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Hausa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicised and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while its activists are fighting against the godless central government.
The activists are first targeting churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists became particularly active with their increased attacks on police stations.
The reaction from Abuja, however, has been as indifferent as ever.
The army is surrounding the city. They're counting 800 dead.
The captured Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect became increasingly radical and abandoned its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that killed 80 people, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing at the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to run from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Haram in Nigeria during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan and said he was willing to "communicate any evidence".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivals in simplicity and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters could almost get that impression.
For some days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their allies have been repeatedly making their thunderous statements and their statements about foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council.
The top candidate for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney, threatened to sue the Chinese at the WTO for "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America deeply irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
He said that it was a mistake to start a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut himself off from the air over his emotionally flattering demeanor.
He had called for a concrete but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard, as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's likeness
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop its nuclear program failed.
"If I am elected, I will order Iran to stop", he had said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of not keeping his promises to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, is showing a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear power" - seemingly ignoring the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, has said he is ready to use the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was banned by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
You're a long way from John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Unlike his current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all that.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and had to add water to his wine when it came to the issue of counter-terrorism.
They are rightly insisting on the failure of his naive negotiations with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his 'boys' from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility is not entirely unforced.
The public is more likely to appreciate the positive record of Obama's national security, which took out bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that can paralyze it.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and glory.
Over 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday, to orchestral accompaniment and a fine-dining buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned the steering wheel of the valve that brings Russian gas to the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline will supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through an initial 1,224 km pipeline linking the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you're already making the case for building a third line on the same line.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous construction is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supplies to Germany, avoiding any transit through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the overland route.
The European Union is also a member of the Council of Europe, which has a special role to play in the development of the European Union.
Warsaw, the most involved in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
The European Union has been able to gain even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, comes at the cost of a decline in European energy, as the project has bridged the gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed in barely five years to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have heavy gas consumption and are running out of gas.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, pointing out the political and economic importance of the major gas contracts.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, who are widely represented in Lubmin, regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete cover to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 meters down.
The construction of the minefields had to avoid the minefields of the Second World War.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
The Commission has also taken steps to protect the flora and fauna.
The line is a long metal snake, weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, uninterrupted by anything along its entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the Swedish coast, but the project officials refused to do so because the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company permanently established on their shores.
"In the event of a breakdown, we close the gas passage in less than a minute", said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas line escapes into the air.
However, this is considered unlikely by the designers, since the welds were estimated to be resistant to one leak every 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the pipeline is provided both by an underwater robot controlled from a sea vessel for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
It is cigar-shaped, one metre in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the pipe at a speed of 3 metres per second, the apparatus will provide the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal on arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also included (each holding 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each holding 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company the entire capacity of its gas transportation on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the actual amount of gas transported is", said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs for both pipelines are expected to be EUR 7.4 billion.
For example, the investment amount for GDF Suez was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are committed to recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is located on a sandy, pine-forested stretch of coast near Lubmin, in the Baltic Sea.
The 15 foot high valves form the gas exit.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook. I'm going to need it.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair for adventure, candlelight hours spent writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-colored pages, as if aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then the company's technical adviser, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called mole skin, which refers to a cotton lacquer used for upholstery, for example.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
The success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12,7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a fantasy picture of the buyers, since the notebook is equally appealing to businessmen, students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured, open-minded client.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centres and is keen to assert its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and its new need for writing, which persists despite the boom in e-mail", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard-patterned cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand has the full range of items.
A success that makes anyone envious: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, opening a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate for disabled people remain so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today marks the beginning of the 15th week of work for the disabled.
Despite a targeted publicity policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still twice the average: 19% as against 9% for the general population.
Discouraged?
"No", emphasizes Éric Blanchet, director general of the association Adapt, which organises the 'Work Week for the Disabled.'"
"Progress has been made in fifteen years".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high".
"Nevertheless, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done".
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they can find a job.
The elderly are more likely to be affected: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, longterm unemployment is also very high: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% for the general population.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the workforce, and that are "the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
What remains is the unspoken, the attitudes that are certain but slow to develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS entrepreneurs' association for La Cité magazine indicated that managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabled people" who are "overrepresented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to meet the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies that break the law.
The evidence: the number of 'fee-paying' establishments and the sum of the amounts paid fell between 2007 and 2011, falling in numbers from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, put a lot of pressure on companies", explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real learning curve, especially for large groups of companies".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a stroke of luck"
Even before they faced the Blues on Tuesday night at 8:45pm, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure from the friendly.
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks volumes symbolically.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had received nothing but praise for his personality.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to look ahead", the native Lille native assures himself.
As for the contrast between his performance at club and national team, "it's a unity that justifies everything".
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania for the match against France to finally "shine".
But without missing the "pleasure" part.
He has been playing for the French national team since he was 7 years old, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported", he said.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the 'unique' character of this meeting.
He said: "We are very excited about the new programme.
"We just ran into each other".
"To play against them is a great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, let "Pride" ring with goodwill.
"Pride of running a gala".
The European Council also called on the Commission to take a more active role in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
"Laurent Blanc did a hell of a job", he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the engineer is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... heading to Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big", he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games", including the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return game against Bosnia (22:00 pm) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the match, both teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest doubt that La Selecçao, his national team, for which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and one opponent to serve, and that is Bosnia.
Considering the 0-0 draw on Friday at Zenica's Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for over an hour, but the team was unable to put the important stamp on the matter that would have taken the pressure off it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score a goal".
At home, however, at their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of beating the odds in front of an audience that should be equally keen to play, even though the game has been declared "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match but we are absolutely convinced that we can win", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"It is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we did not score a goal", Bento regrets.
"We will be playing against a team with high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intended to apply maximum pressure on the Bosniaks from the outset to 'not give them time to think.'"
A good idea, provided it's put into action this time.
