The CSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the cake industry.
The new CSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious linguistic barriers so that the components of the Prague Board and the municipal council understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new CSSD Council to verify their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in the last years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the flower and political nata of Prague during the previous period, of Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councils hardly understand those known concepts.
At least that they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
“The truth is that I don’t know it.”
"But I'm a beginner in Prague politics," said during the "collegium" terminology examination the council of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And as regards the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may know the concept of “golf day”.
“Maybe it’s the only expression of all that you asked me what I use from time to time.”
“If not, I usually don’t use slang.”
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the ODS vote congress, the draft chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the greatest golf hole in Prague", "to go to the cake industry", "the bull knot", "the capital's betrayal" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth council, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things nor do I think about how civic Democrats are entertaining.”
"What I really care is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs," he said.
As seen, supposedly the council Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential entrepreneur and a friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" doesn't tell him anything; the only term he suited at the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the White Tunnel,” says Kaucký, adding immediately, “but rather I know it for the news.”
“I’m going to have to point to a language course,” she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Then both sociodemocrats know who Voldemort is really and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the cake".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon Plachý reveals that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the sociodemocrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really seems that we don’t have anything like it.”
“But among us we use titles, sometimes abbreviations, or we make words games with the names,” says Praganese ČSSD president, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
“In school I was called Bříza, but I don’t know if my colleagues also call me so,” Karel Březina said.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceit during the party sponsorship, receives the title of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
The titles are also the only expressions that sociodemocrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský doesn't like him to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other titles for this Pragan president.
"The doctor of the rights of the pores" according to it seems reminds that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "brothers", according to a brochure
Women considered to be witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an older age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "receive" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
“Men rarely suffer like this.”
"Neither is it isolated to healthy young women, because they help in the tasks and have children," a monk who, in the capital of the state of West Africa, Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informative brochure that should help prevent witches hunting.
However, this has a stick.
“More than 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” the newspaper Die Standard warns about the disadvantages of awareness in writing.
The charges of witch are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors say that it was due to a unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for the ritual untions.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to “expell the evil spirits” of the woman.
The isolation of the "brothers" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “The devorers of human souls have always represented a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt of the witches who, supposedly, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic.”
“To help him, he brought shamanes from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and president’s personal escort, brought to force men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
In the finca, the people arrested had to drink a pork of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay in the property.
After international pressure, approximately a thousand people were finally released.
Bakala's rental: heating with coal stoves and signing a higher rental
The man, of advanced age and rege, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon magnet" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rented floors in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm he carried some documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son, who is fulfilling sentence.
Three of them just got the liberalization of rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-storey floor with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it has no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel caldera," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which qualified the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends rentalers not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, date on which it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, in front of this, man only makes an ademan.
“Everyone says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of liberalization testing.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to catch numbers.
"Rental 2011" can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
By pressing it, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost doesn’t give time even to read “157” and already the number appears on the big screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you are on the tail.
Shortly afterwards, an old-age marriage comes to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve usual problems, such as formerly: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the renters' pockets of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes on the cards a rental increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18 a special window is opened in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It works a week, so it's starting," responds, after briefly doubt, the workers who find themselves in it when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
The liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, they were already high and clearly treated by the Vice-President of the Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
Twenty years later, I want a new ground.
“Neither changed me the bad dish of the bathroom,” the man mentioned in the introduction disappears.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a rental discount if they sign in time, as promised by the special RPG offer.
The rest of the tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of the mining “liberalization” undoubtedly fails to dissolve the avalanche of doubts.
“From the 360 customers who were here yesterday, just asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people,” the window employee estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to make individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, the matter must be resolved by an independent judge.
“It’s not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law,” RPG warns on its pages.
“There’s no one going to be judged,” says one of the RPG employees Byty and a man on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 for food; I don’t have any means to go to the courts,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
“We will see.”
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media that they don’t sign, so people wait,” he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
“The current rental still does not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,” reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that anger rentalers is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rental.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with the rents to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the roof, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
“The rise in rental in 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e., more than 90% of RPG properties.”
“In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month,” it is indicated on the screen.
Just increased by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it’s an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
At 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not hit rents, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rental (see the graph) again in the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be the persons who sign the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need guardianship
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say it hides also inside a small gardener with everything in its own to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can attend it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose study numerous well-known buildings from Brno came out, thought from the early sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its miniguardery.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and delineators to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the gardenery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers within the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The miniguardery was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s miniguardian is funded through the European Social Fund in the framework of the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a donation of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they could buy equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the miniguardery in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
Children’s care is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nurse currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it’s a “minority”, it can only accommodate simultaneously a maximum of five children, although with the turns they go more during the day.
The operation of the nurse is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nurse, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the childhood program are comparable to the usual pre-school teaching program.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, teaching to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking late school children when they are far from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is placed among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in the end, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the lame of a prehistoric slope, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals named it "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the new use of the stone, the fragments of blacks and mosaics, a façade that reminds of the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s secession.
The cover of the house plays with onyrial lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
The serpent and the tortion of the shapes continue to surprise us also inside.
The wave wood copies the frames of the windows, the bars, the doors of the doors, the mirillas and the bridges.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the neighborhood of Eixample in the number 43 of the animated shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house of the year 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on destroying the previous building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, formed by various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
It was designed by architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, in their plans of the project arose adorns for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the façade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell de Gaudí, in which other pieces of the same are found.
Due to its organic shape, the locals shortly after its completion named it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the busts".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, pattern of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating era with ventilation respirators and typical chemines.
It can be strange its 45 degrees inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply with the construction rules of the moment and did not be influenced by them.
However, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated about the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the municipality was so impacted with the result that it asked to be corrected.
It disturbed him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public edge.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the municipality, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
In the lower floors the owner was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and in the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The floor was rented to a jewelry.
The house, six-storey, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without trouble, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue blacks that cover the inner courtyard and trailers.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on every floor of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and rechargeed apartment of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, with the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it’s a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the bakery, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist cards holders get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the entrance price of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed atmosphere with your slurry towers, you should quickly become a friend of some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and somier: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumped frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to be buried, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they should be complemented perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the choice many elements come into play, including the weight, height, health and sex of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that doesn’t usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they’re “heated” more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels of the center are not properly aired and above are on a firm base, keep them inside the moisture.
When choosing a bed, the customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling well on a lower and harder surface.
Almost all the hockey players who returned from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep well here.”
"For their machucated shoulders, talons and heads needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
“This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time nervous system problems, so they receive bad information from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in the clothed furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
“Today there’s no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico.”
You no longer have to be a NHL player to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, it will not turn as after a hard match.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastics also works as a wound protection.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
That a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: when you tumble mouth up, you should have your hands comfortably hanged towards the coats," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has already many years engaged in the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomy of furniture, a topic she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs their own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the somers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with mould interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and smooth.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you accommodate it on the mattress, you should not notice the mole," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully clothed bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are like siames, have no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and they cannot be washed, which is often done today.
And, given that every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congestioned) tamiz.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans that speak of a mattress life up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
Everything has one but.
For this reason, sellers give a advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully care about the cleaning and washing of the foam, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although currently mattress funds are manufactured with cremallery closure throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for the washing and the washing machine size!), their manipulation in the bigger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a mosque weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, has a firm table?
Never to!
As much for the beds designed to spend a night the visits.
However, you need to make (if you don’t already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with molds in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with molds in pockets (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable layers and containing between 14 and 18 layers, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses can be used (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better a layer with a greater number of layers, 28 or more, in which the layers of the lumbar area are strengthened and its rigidity can be regulated.
It should not be used with a mold mattress, as it does not react to recrycling.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or, even, incline the sheets in such a way that "rode" perfectly to your shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They even remember the mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a more soft area precisely around their shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a more soft area around the roofs.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structure or tablets with the so-called multitortion amortisation.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, although you use the appropriate mattress and somer, if you use a bad coat (great and "mulled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the hat must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The appropriate recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When buried on the side, the coat should be at the same level (when combined with the coat with shoulder reinforcement or the softest area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, as it seems, with the original mattresses filled with paja.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixture.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as ricin or soy.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soya.
“Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of natural materials,” explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacturing of the mattress foam, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with brice vegetable extract, so that the mattress foam absorbs heat and refresh the body, women prefer to "heat" the foam.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
The favourites right now?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities enables the manufacturing of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and talks go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as medical means.
The first one to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on the mattresses and mattresses.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the foam for 11,990 crowns.
The second is available for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the launch loas astronauts were subjected to an enormous overload.
Tempur is overwhelmed with heat and hardened with cold.
Consequently, the human body, warm, exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Consequently, it is ideal to prevent wounds, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for health products, for example, for clothes that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
The domestic manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar foam.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for the tracking of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute thus, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
Currently, the device has the approximate size of a cylinder box, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a clock.
A lot of people feared the case of the missing Anička and began informing about the available means to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
“We all try to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but another means to decrease the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put into someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" serves and how it is used in the event of emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just throw it out.
“Even younger children show great creativity when deliberately losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled.”
“Before, parents trusted tremendously in mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bočková says.
In your opinion, it is controversial whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child carries any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location.”
“Today is the phone.”
"After extending the use of the tracking devices, they will also search for them, since their sale will be done with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"The device can be configured so that it regularly sends the position after a given period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices carry an integrated inclination meter, so if the person simply scratches and remains immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says Čech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with mobile smartphones with navigation, in which only a special software should be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that at the moment it is about devices with a size similar to a cylinder box or the smaller mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
“In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device.”
“Of let him identify him after a certain time, which can make the police make time,” he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for tracking vehicles.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechas to surround the entire Czech Republic. but only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to capture explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have existences for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the mecha is two years, four to the top.
The army bought the blade for explosives to the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The staff of the General replied to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such an enormous amount of mecha saying that soldiers need for the training maneuver 60 kilometers of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES was in touch, it is decided however that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuver with frequent use of explosives every year also all the generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleansers.
They didn’t want exemptions even the Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only so could it be justified that the army spent 60 kilometers of mecha.
This length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of the engineers or special units) sufficient existences for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the fast-intervention brigade complained personally recently to the Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let’s not talk about the lack of clothes.
“I also can’t understand that we are repeatedly purchasing such amounts of mecha.”
“But it’s your decision and they’ll undoubtedly know why they’re doing so.”
“For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy,” admits STV Group’s commercial director, Jan Děcký.
Defense ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha and also says he will have existences of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a lifetime of four years and, in the case of the pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticism of the army, doesn't want to give his name.
After the completion of its lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument by the Ministry is that, by purchasing 445 kilometers of mecha, it received a discount.
“We cost 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pejšek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s shopping center.
Only to compare: the annual mecha consumption of the police pyrotechnics, which remove the ammunition from the Second World War or the left by the Soviet army, does not exceed since years the 1,500 meters.
Moreover, the police always ask only the fair amount as to exhaust the ammunition before its life ends.
They decided it for security reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, while more modern and reliable mecha types can be achieved.
The ministry already has clear difficulties to end tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact time, when the two hundred thousand people’s Czech army was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES talked, after a couple of years the following problem with the current will occur: there will be to remove hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now buying "barata".
So far I continue to live from the contacts I got thanks to the competition.
The fact of winning the "Year's Entrepreneur" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
The last edition, won the contest "The Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His story of success seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved traveling.
Abroad it was realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-destroyed composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
“At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began to rent the first floor reconstructed to foreign workers.
All the income it obtained invested again in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the businessman number one last year.
“To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped greatly the fact of winning the ‘The Entrepreneur of the Year’ competition,” added grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very pleasant,” she recalls.
I definitely recommend everyone who wants to try some company to participate in the contest.
But he considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
It says that, until now, it is still living from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, would not have been obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started to collaborate usual."
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
A total of about 70.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that obtained general recognition.”
“It’s not, much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
"It's only my name that appears on the first floor," says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we have had at Farmet.
The euforia for victory soon dissolved by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
Farmet’s owner, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone “The Company of the Year” competition last year at the “Slav House” in Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a business volume of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in fighting against competition," the winner said last year.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žďárský's father the rental of a small workshop as a compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not doubt too much; he renounced his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic printing in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized audience after achieving the success in the competition in the media.
“Not only our customers began to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was not in Farmet just a sample of the euforia of victory.
It also received recognition for trade outcomes until 2008 and, partially, from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We obviously do not get rid of such a situation.”
“The revenue decreased by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some dismissals,” Karel Žďárský explains.
A viable company should, sometimes, adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation andined the company’s profits, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the subsidies we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs,” says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenue increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement hopes it will bring a feeling of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere,” says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one-third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech social security administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check of the insured’s impositions,” said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic should respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year he forms for the fourth time part of the Hospodářské noviny business tournament and begins to create affection also among the general public.
While last year’s edition counted with the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
“Maybe in the number of papers necessary for tax declaration we are in the world’s first place,” says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation improves especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Czech Republic lies in the 74th place, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez Competition of the Year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antipremy" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets more votes.
For this year’s survey more than a hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that have no meaning, were submitted.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the “finalists” of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of the roads and highways pay the fee or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the 70 proposals this year is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which is always made at the beginning of November at the Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which people from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, the contest was attended by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot beined if the State continuously puts trouble to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek said.
The efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations are not left in dirt water.
In the year 2007, what most annoyed people was the businessman’s obligation to communicate with a three-day in advance to the business office of the permanent operation zone, the intention to go with a place to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of the work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
The third is the defeated.
The 2009 Absurd was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a great mirror, a refrigerator and two bascules of soil.
That’s why this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called the responsible company of the year 2010.
The commitment of this contest consists in supporting responsible and fair companies.
“This way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the event of the Rebel of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s main competition of Vodafone Enterprise of the year 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities completely vary between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the people with disabilities, in other of the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic was, for example, the Praganese software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of responsible company in the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main funding provider for sponsorship of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paperwork that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of Enterprise responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the competition Vodafone Enterprise of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it purchases priority from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the smallest possible impact on the environment,” says entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Persons in trouble scholarship, which in particular helps the local Romanian community,” said Ondřej Suchý, representative of the company.
The washing company Praní a čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact on their pension funds, is also in good place.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapáč, from Bruntál Czasch’s construction company, winner in the Moravia-Siles region.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year were automatically designated all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before 15 August to the organizers.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or incorrect.
“If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Year’s Responsible Company, but they are not disqualified from the “main” competition of the year’s Vodafone Company.”
“Individual candidatures for this contest are not permitted, since it is a subcategory of the main Enterprise contest of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose counseling agency.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the Agriculture Fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media entrepreneur and the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
This attempt seems to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned ground would be received by a precise interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are searching for a person for suborno during a public auction and public tender," said to Právo the chief general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment it can't disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
About how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, only can be speculated.
Agriculture Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá replied to Pravo’s questions saying the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen’s headquarters and was during a public auction.
“It’s a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocatory for the submission of proposals for transfer of land in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
“These people, during the call, offer a value greater than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the ground is announced.”
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, then, the Agricultural Fund transfers the ground to the person offering the greatest offer," the spokesman of the Fund said.
Luboš G. had information about who was going to be submitted to the call and, given that at the same time it is an interested person because it acquired various rights of restitution, proposed the interested parties on the ground that it would not participate in the auction.
For this reason, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It appeared in the case of former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some land planned for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Then, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the city’s historic centre with a very higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay additional spending of several hundred crowns per month
Houses will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
Consequently, families will have to get out of the portfolio, from January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise of electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have reduced prices because it has increased support for renewable energy production, photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderate, especially when the heating is most used and therefore the consumption is greater.
In this case, they should also count a couple of hundreds of crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are incurred throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from one place to another.
The rise of prices is primarily planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 more crowns per month, while Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in water and heating prices, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented floors in Prague may increase considerably, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rental from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
Young Czechs are boiled with Fernet and ron. Beer is no longer so, because it makes effect slowly
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen to their parents.
These are the beverages that cause to end in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen years.
Children who end up falling into the hospital continuously to overcome the resaca are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who find such cases in the hospital's pediatric admissions.
“Being beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to embrace them.”
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," Pravo says the head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
“When they manage to take a bottle of their father’s alacena, it can be whisky, but it’s usually about Fernet and vodka.”
“Vodka has the advantage that it is aligned with juice and that it doesn’t smell so much,” she explains.
This is confirmed by the spokesman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
“Normally, it’s usually about Fernet or Ron.”
“These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use garment they got at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, drinkers are thirteen and fourteen years old who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he works since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulance carried the young people from the nearby areas.
“A girl had to enter four times.”
“It started at the age of twelve, when it was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with extasis,” the doctor of the department said.
“He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party.”
“The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drink by their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak about dependency.
"A person who has a chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which is not produced in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it’s due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” Pelikán explains.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in Motol's pediatric clinic 40 ebrio children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who go with a severe poison and should stay in the hospital.
Young drinks who, after ambulant medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink aguardient, for Pelikán there are three seasonal heights that can be mentioned: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
“In such circumstances, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays.”
“In the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven ebry children at the same time,” added Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible rescue at home.
Morning headaches, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, are avoided by the injection of a glucose serum and the nutrients that lack the body.
"These take it much better, because after the agitated night they wake up well and do not hurt them anything."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelikán said, adding that patients often lose good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost a dozen thousand crowns.
“I’ve often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunk has cost and they’ll have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people so you’ll earn enough to pay that night,” Pelikán adds.
The medical insurance, in your opinion as a regressive measure, which usually returns to people the treatment expenses, does not do so in the case of children drinking.
Two L-159 aircraft first found in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time a device of this type is found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to perform practical or demonstration flights.
It is the biplace version of the L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and which was still in the air.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159.
These are still retained at Aer Vodochody and the sale intermediary, the company Omnipol, has already taken care of them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the aircraft will physically be withdrawn from Vodochody.
“The monoplast L-159 aircraft, in turn, were separated from the aircraft repaid long ago, without any additional investments or contributions by the Ministry.”
“The L-159T1 biplases were exchanged in their current state,” Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army will not be left without biplace aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for biplace.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly indicates that the company EADS is the one that removes the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practice of pilots from NATO countries.”
“Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework,” said Pejšek.
The Hospodářské noviny newspaper published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by Mirek Topolánek's government.
The Ministry of Defense did not call for a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Air 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the latter should reach the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A finger index longer than the canular indicates a lower risk of developing cancer
Men who have the longer index than the cancellation are subject to a lower risk of suffering from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our findings indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple proof of the risk of developing prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years old,” said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Consequently, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, if this feature goes associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he carried out the tracking with a British homologist of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand finger shorter than the cancellation.
They presented the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech genetist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he doesn’t think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be “totally demonstrated”.
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like the majority of Europe, sinked on Thursday covered with snow.
The roads and roads are covered mainly by compact snow and the quitanive machines circulated throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between the kilometers 89 and 93 in direction of Rozvadov due to several industrial vehicles and tourism accidents, as well as the D1 in Brno in direction of Prague.
The news was by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the Kilometre 91 a truck crashed, in the Kilometre 93 two industrial vehicles collided which caused injuries.
Several tourisms also ended in the county.
There are also problems on the D1 highway on the kilometre 185 in direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must circulate slowly after Brno in the kilometre 190 or cross Brno and incorporate into the kilometre 182 in Kývalce.
There have been several kilometers of blocks.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stamps are forming, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congestioned by Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trains circulate with delay, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At 8 a.m. there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
The Ruzyně airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can already circulate through most South Moravia roads, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to circulation, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain roads of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Until now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
For cleaning it will be required frescoes.
It is not yet known when they will be opened.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic there fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reached the 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall is gradually shifting to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. Army is employing in Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, currently known only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that “the progress of the game” would make their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise score.
Their balls are shot with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the elevated load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies that are hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trunk.
Without a doubt, you can’t use a normal protection and, when you throw your killer rain of metal stalls, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who talked about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses a “smart” technology.
“The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, they point to the same their laser light, which determines the distance, then it obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, it corrects the projection line and presses the catch.”
“We say that 543 meters have been measured.”
“When the gun is pushed, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, less than one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs are transferred.
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 men and women will move in July of the next year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße street in the Niederrad neighborhood in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term more than 100 employees from the consortium, who were previously spread by the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will also favour the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only rental in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new shift of a major company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were for and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of economic department, Markus Frank (CDU) said that it has won a “Global Player.”
This is a “magnificant recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The headquarters informed the city of its intention.
“Naturally we have offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
Finally, the economic reasons resulted in the decline.
Thus, now there is a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
“I hope the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative.”
The property previously used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" formed part with the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial construction project of the resort city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the municipality, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the mass building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and taxation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt Real Estate Group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
Therefore, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the twentieth years, its name allies to its plane with a star shape, hosts among others the central electrotechnical association and the electronic industry.
Amazon Cancelled Server – Threats Against Assange
There is an increasing number of news on Wikileaks.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the revelation platform from its server.
Per behind it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is always the white of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former U.S. server and are currently looking for an internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s list of searched persons, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
“Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server.”
“Talk freely in the country of freedom,” the revelation activists communicated through the messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service website to be able to deal with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: “Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, CNN according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council of the country had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian.
“I wanted Amazon to take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks,” Senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
“The illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process of Wikileaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world,” the Senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people searched by Interpol.
According to an article from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian man is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has constantly qualified the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
“There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.”
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains unknown.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that Wikileaks' revelations responsible should be judged for betrayal and should be executed.
In Canada, a counselor to the head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should be "morted" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange is growing a big dispute.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs said it was "ridical and absurd" that Assange had requested the secretary of state's resignation, if she was responsible for ordering recently diplomats to engage in spying tasks.
“I’m not completely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to prove the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, Deputy Distribution Director of the National Center Against Terrorism, was appointed an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms” that are necessary in the light of Wikileaks’ filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of the dissidents and activists, they must put the publication of Wikileaks in danger.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream is prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future freezer has the highest affluence and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the ice really come from?
The ice cream and the ice cream.
The gelatiere prepares the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream preparation.
The ice sheet pulls with a spatula the ice cream from the showcase, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, shouldn’t visit the “Gelato University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future freezer has the highest affluence and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more-day courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream of the home itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice their vague desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business adviser and wants to create something of its own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a freezer in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only its good taste, but also its smoothness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the nata cover of the national and mainly southern house: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the preparation seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, nata, milk in powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big batch, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment heats it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine's grape and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give a break off to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises to take off the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", probably has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably garum goma, garum beans.
Of course you can make ice without a stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients those purchased in the fruit section or in the supermarket’s sweets.
In addition, there are dust and pasta.
“All suppliers will try to paste aromatized ingredients in their goods.”
“But they should ever try it.”
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cacao powder as the basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the participants of the course can use the freezer.
Luciano lets them elaborate every time four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and avellana, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment with fruit ice cream.
That you know better doesn’t necessarily depend on that you have more toffe aroma or more fruit puret.
It is not necessary that avellana ice cream knows to dry fruits, if it contains more avellana.
The work group elaborates the favourite kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, Luciano says.
The elaboration of ice cream is an arthmetic problem: the puré of melocotone is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe has to be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensile with which it sets the amount of sugar from the types of fruits (mediation of the vineyard for Oechsle in the grape mouth).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Eating ice does not require more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the utensile for the automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also a utensile, in which the prepared ice mixture is simultaneously beat and cooled at zero temperature.
Despite all, all automation is left out as far as the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo blows himself and his comrades up to down with fruit puré, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
“In all courses,” says the master Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time that something like that happens.”
Inspectors in a Difficult Situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry that experiments with transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert are also hired for years in the ILSI association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the EFSA verification standards of genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interests, says Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or time of transition to Switzerland Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which held the General Office of the Environment as well as a parliamentary clarivident of the EU.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data is recourse, also some of the industry, as long as they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
They have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment for biotechnology without the Lobby’s commission.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently transgenic plants are allowed without animal food research and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified corn in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice consists in verifying only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?", asks, accused, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck is the same.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this field, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and in Europe, to influence or disacredit critical scientists.
There are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For companies, critical studies are not published by a general rule.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Track of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in a total of about 400 pounds.
Monday was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on the back.
There were demonstrations
and Nevada.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to break down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was precinted, most of the wing was shattered.
It runs 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
“These stones are relics.”
“They should not disappear.”
It is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, the smoke of cigarettes has smelled.
He still doesn’t know what he’ll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier ammunition deposit of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man treats with old stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would melt the gravel or they would send it to the wheat," a wooden box said in his office that once was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing to the defeat company.
He talked with the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained that he could not do absolutely anything for the collapse.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 pounds cut butter, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came everywhere and took what they could carry in the luggage and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has long become the "wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“In reality this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“If not the political party.”
He rises to his all-terrain, making a tour through his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It has 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures throughout Germany.
It says it is the country’s largest trader of ancient stones.
and brake.
In the snow there are artistic stones of sand.
“They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke,” he explains.
Caliza alba, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
“My dear stone.”
The road crosses the forest.
Sign a lot: Red Arenisca, an earlier piece of the Karlsruhe Station.
and continue.
“Good travertine.”
Anciently the butterflies belonged to the Neckarstadion tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police headquarters of Stuttgart, red granite of the church of Sankt Blasien, top of the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks how he first sculpted the stones and moved them with a simple parade and a carpet, he feels very devoted.
“It would be a scandal if something was destroyed.”
He has not become rich, in absolute immense wealth.
But today 14 people gave to do the stone treader, in addition stones, a sculptor, a stone, a glass and a gardeners have been installed up in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the remains said.
Soon he must go to Colonia.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent struggle around great potential
Reign an active affluence in the buffet.
16 students gather around the potatoes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission is to hire students with the most talented universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and be hired by others.
And as universities do not provide publications about the skills of their students, they try to catch out exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second project day at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady of the staff department distributes bulgars, rubber and carpets with the VW logo.
It explains the illusions of young talents of the programmes and students' work and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"At its turn, VW can meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desirable so directly.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All engineering disciplines students are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineering jobs.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this emptiness of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and consulting company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the hunting of talents.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through the GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight highly promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
“With the race we want to stand out of the mass.”
“The simple journey by itself was short.”
For the Dykta hunter, the notes give results.
"From today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are close to their end, and they want to request to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also on the hunt, especially the small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fair.
“We are trying to get students at the specialized fair.”
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, a staff manager for Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, there are 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill the vacancies.”
“It takes a lot of time and money,” he said.
A short way is the contact with the university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Teachers advise that you can do practices with us or make your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A great consortium normally can’t offer it,” says Stübe, the staff officer.
In search of a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The crucial factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good rising opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the employees’ prior conditions.
Stübe, the staff staff also awaits extra points in their ranking for their aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant is specifically fixed on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Make your customers more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the branch of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then promotion is achieved directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a band,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil perforations
From the U.S. coast of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years any new oil perforation.
The Washington government issued a rigorous prohibition and thus cancelled its previous plans in an inapplicable way.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remains new perforations seen for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to thus decrease the U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today, it has not been clarified completely who is responsible for the irreparable black marea in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A research committee commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Later, various peterol consortiums submitted applications for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe by using harder controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen in unreliance, is reformed from root.
Obama has announced that the profitable tax lagoons for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to a more strict regulation, so far.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey carried out by the advisory company BDO – before Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are extended soon, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined.
The water of the rivers is oil marble, it smells like a gasoline: Millions of liters of raw waste have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist calms the journalists: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float over the surface.
Before I got gambas here, Esther Badom explains on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was thrown into the formidable moisture by a broken pipeline.
The fish surrounding the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to get to fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the most stained regions in the world.
On the road of the river that passes through manglars, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown hot, who drow his hand into the water, will get some full of oil.
The roots of the manglar trees are raised from the ground as dark palms of regaliz, sadly isolating the palms that shock and hang their palms.
In vain they are searching for bird bands, as if they were in the moist as always: as soon as the barrier of the outside is silent, a kind of ghost calm of a previous paradise expands in it with a gasoline smell.
“What happens here is an ecological struggle,” says Celestine Akpobari. ”We live in a constant danger for health.”
It is a belical comparison.
The Ogoni settlement area is a rough battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers flooded more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they bombed daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the whole delta region, a size three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipes, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred meters highlighted steel platforms as strawberry water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the perforators.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
Every moment a head falls, Akpobari thinks, then manages a constant rush of oil in the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been wasted in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the fall of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Sea of Alaska, one of the largest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil robbery are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, ecologists see the headlines about to break down and pipes with leaks as the main causants.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world the conventional, rejected scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only tubes defects are “over a greater multiple than elsewhere”.
In a place, which from far seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures arise from among the manglars: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes connected to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily spread over the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heating in the fire more hours, says Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipes go and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel: “It brings us 34,000 naira,” around $22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of the diesel of just 40 euros-cents per litre, illegal heater can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers,” who tricked the pipeline network that travels Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in aljibs and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the float way of production.
“If the oil firms did not behave as invaders and did not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robbery, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael is nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular Ölmann.
“The soldiers can come in any minute.”
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, if not with a painful surrender.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This condemned invention has made pieces completely to our country,” says Akpobari.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in the A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The Qantas airline wants to demand the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much more lucky than you can imagine: Australian air security authorities perceived, thanks to their investigations, a major safety problem on the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a mango connection, fissures can be caused by fatigue or scratches, ATSB authorities announced in a Thursday-published report.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Qantas-Airbus had to land forced on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline begins legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit to the federal court in Sydney that enabled more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said that his airline will claim a compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine have lost pieces and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on the superjobs equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all the affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa resigned the engine of an A380 as a precautions measure.
This double-covered aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada in the whole country causes chaos in traffic
Germany completely white: From one day to another has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, train and aircraft fail.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
The winter ice Germany: In almost all over the country gel temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the quitanieves are in continuous operation, taking the new snow again and again, but it’s not ready.
Furthermore, strong wind rays barry the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) is expecting living floods with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saigon, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on the highways and on the national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for removing it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities significant disorders on the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created blocks.
In Turingia, the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, large disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on the roads or the destroyed catenery and holes are the main problems.
In Saigon, the interurb service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue services served the 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink mantles.
The winds with snow burst the streets.
In the largest airport in Germany, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been canceled.
The quitanes are continuously operating.
However, there are few passengers walked at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon, there have already been many accidents.
In the afternoon, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowed streets: Also here a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a rough road.
Meteorologists have a good news: the snow will be more and more soft and dust-type and therefore will be shrinking in soft rocks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will continue making a lot of cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banks neighborhood were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the reimbursement, and is looking for a buyer for the two scratches, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
“We always check whether it is appropriate to possess the properties or sell them and then rent them again,” he said.
This is why the largest credit institution in Germany resigns from its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the Twin Towers in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renowned as "Greentowers" in around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people are saddened by the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were considered dead after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, because security measures continue to be precarious in the place of misery.
Nearly two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of misfortune, but no survival sign was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could go down for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deducted that there was no possibility that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered until now.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand’s southern island.
Stay silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables with helmets, lamps and names of the miners were placed.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surf tables.
The flags walked at the middle of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand government president John Key told the participants of the commemorative event.
“They never returned home.”
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Together with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
The first explosion on November 19 was also buried miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures in the mine will begin to decline, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To the devil, warrior!
Is it in the artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the gender borders with his epopeya of battles "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he plays “Walhalla Rising”?
A single-eye prisoner Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) releases his tortureers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman struggles, it sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and kick out his enemies the tribes of his bodies with life when he’s in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, doesn’t say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters are left to be taken by as much one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
It is rather ideal for growing and interested filmmakers in existencialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot be discarded each other.
The director Winding Refn considers his wilds and the trilogy about the drug trafficking hair "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is stoically denied to make his works for all the public with something more of humor in the main current or something less of brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and a broken trips cannot disguise the majority of artistic cinema followers.
Most of the action fans die of boring, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Cristian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and the cloud before his team arrives in America and rests quiet there.
It is a regret that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presuntuous and bloody façade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film does not deal with dialogues or a logical action, it’s all atmosphere, a feveral dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images and the luxurious trance soundtrack make him a nest in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a little young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, keeps something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Most importantly, the one-eye hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents loss, but only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to be angry, altered and surprised.
It is an experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The OIEA nuclear energy organization has new signs of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to make an opinion on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the Euphrates coast; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Organization (OIEA), it talks about a reactor that the Syrians seemed to have built with North Korea’s help in the cube, hidden in a valley that goes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. international intelligence service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor under the name of the proximity of the Kibar is designed very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique barely serves for other purposes than for those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with dirty satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs that showed the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
It was shortly since the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than at that time, the enigmas became greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack the CIA was completely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor on the Kibar, but that he barely saw indications that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more prudent and only talk about a "subject reactor", although they consider "plausible" the CIA presentation.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the OIEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior diplomat of the NU answered in summer in a lapidary way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly dismantled the ruins of the alleged "unused military building" and allocated the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008 an OIEA team under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of a member state, from commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which must have a greater informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not come to the market because an unknown customer, Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the OIEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranus came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
The IAEA rejected it as an inverosymile after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, just as it is about satellite images.
In addition, controlers are prohibited from a second inspection at the Kibar and entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strong silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not given results since June 2008 and “progressively turns into a serious credibility problem for the authorities,” as a high-level Western diplomat corresponds with a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally is pending a serious infringement against the non-proliferation treaty of atomic weapons, by which the IAEA seeks.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made publicly known until the moment of what teams are treated, neither what functions they have, nor whether they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated as internal Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which very likely is one of the suspicious objects.
Probably located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits with this reason the entrance to the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians are afraid of a record that the U.S. has requested to the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert about the equipment thanks to the U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, the OIEA has indications that material is moved between the three places and the cube on the Euphrates shore.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment nor of re-conditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should later be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best of the cases, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in the three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks from the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the rubbish remains.
The OIAE considers improbable the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometers from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its aptitude as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three alleged suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested the entry.
It can be a coincidence, but it barely helps to dissolve the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop an inspection plan there, that the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the displacement shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has no much urgency, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, grims the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that Vienna’s nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future", but still vacillates.
This path is very risky: for this it is needed the majority of the IAEA’s board of governments, and some of the 35 countries there represented are not precisely looking forward to an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thought, "And what happens if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in the Time of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut yet unnamed.
She has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
There is not much more known about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rape during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, with which in the last moment they moved some planned days of drawing in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in postproduction, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, ACNUR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the Ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It’s not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position in this regard delates the victims enough about the script.
His organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read the script, granted after a shot and flows a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not completely clear why Jolie did not go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
On the network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "the victim of rape falls in love with a tortured."
It is sure that Jolie's film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on wrong information."
Currently they can peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, as many others previously.
Nothing as far from here.
This evening is finally good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the U.S.
Fans scream of joy as they reboot high music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in Southern Ireland's Cork, because players throw, and find, pingpong balls to the beers from a distance of three meters.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few air tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this striking drink game and computer discretion actually don’t make good mice.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distracted from the fulmining question, what the future will find him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January he will make a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad presence,” he says.
“It’s very far from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and her brother Colin is currently working as IT advisor in London.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the Dublin Institute of Social Research ESRI forecast.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
This is a huge loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, it comes a migratory wave comparable to which the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholia is now extending.
The economic crisis confuses mostly the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is cost up.
Employment loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty years are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young immigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is flooding."
“There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it to a whole generation.”
“The last one that shuts the door.”
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union sees a dark future appear because the government is only dedicated to assemblies and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to new jobs,” the 20-year-old girl says.
Watch how your colleagues go from unreumerated practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
“This idea is sad and depressive.”
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the “WorkingAbroadExpo”, a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career,” the manager says.
On his website appear photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if not that it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how it is to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we go to Hannover or Berlin, to the following project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, as it’s been a long time since he first stepped the threshold of his house.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I’m never so good.”
He laughs somewhat ashamed and goes to ice rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a credit.
“There were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hear today.
“No one should get hungry, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, with that we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
“After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see how life is elsewhere.
He has already worked a couple of years in London and why would he and his girlfriend not go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries him overwhelmingly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I'll be able to degenerate on a farewell party.
“Only, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
“Forget, it sounds very angry.”
“Better we call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.”
The Democratic Routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows to track the changes in attitude in the region.
In the results of this year’s survey, held in September and early October, two related issues are highlighted.
The first is the relatively animated humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also grown in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which falls the regional average (see chart 2).
Around 44% of respondents in the region declared satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25% registered in 2001 (Graph 3).
Around 34% said they trust Congress in their country and 45% in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulences in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has beenined during the world financial crisis is probably due to the fact that numerous Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protecting the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty just increased marginally in 2009 and that it has decreased again this year, up to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic returns and the popularity of its emerging president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more surveyed in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem their country faces (see chart 5).
Around 31% say they or a close relative have been a victim of the crime in the last year, a figure that has decreased since 38% last year and is the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of the surveyers in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises a greater leadership in the region, as indicates 19% of the respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (the 9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (the 9% against 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered the most influential by the respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to Waste
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they passed in a much worse way than the foreigners were afraid of trying to help the country rise behind their problems.
Votes were introduced in the urns, some people voted several times, paperets thrown on the boards, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, walked through the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them were eventually defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and demanded the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking UN official in Haiti, said it was "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observators from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that “we don’t think these irregularities, no matter how serious they are, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its counterparts is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The departure is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes have been lost with regard to the election.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who barely has support, if has any, has passed to the second round.
Having in mind that the cholera epidemic strikes the country and more than a million of the earthquake survivors continue to live in stores, a great abstinence is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There is a lot in play.
The donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been stated, the Haitians themselves also think of it.
Going from the point to the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all, that it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected lady Fernández leaves the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take care of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of elaborating budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some discrepancy members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one Deputy gave a blow to another in the face and other Deputies accused the government of overwhelming, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, as a result, will be applied for the next year, which will offer the president an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the salary requirements of the trade unions, place it close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the edge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction be his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pushed the private sector and made the Indec, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will the President of the Republic, Mr. Ferguson, change this policy?
He has called for meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade unions.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Per it’s right Mrs. Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentine’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders who had denied a forced prior restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Currently, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditors gathered in the Paris Club, which owes around $6.7 billion.
Kirchner has always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as it is usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new price index for national consumption, which seems the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue politics when she ends her term, taking into account that she no longer has her husband next to her.
If he does so, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, a large part of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have fallen down.
If you want to win other elections, you’ll have to decide whether or not repudiate, calmly, many of your husband’s policies.
Half Hurra in China
The Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its great brother on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, went on November 27 to choose the mayor and councillors of five urban districts in what seems a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of the feelings for the continent, shaping innovative business bonds, including a partial free trade treaty, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) ended winning three of the five mayor elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has tended for a total independence from Taiwan, obtained practically 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party’s votes has decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD empathed with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections we could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
The mysterious attempt to murder was also not missing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the KMT’s honorary president, was making campaign for one of the KMT’s candidates the night before the elections.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly to his face, wounding him and killing a transgender.
The curious thing is that it has not been able to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or revenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and provoking voters to tend to the KMT.
Per the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public accommodation and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Consequently, the KMT is usually avoiding advertising its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new consciousness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma said he had confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable for the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to overwhelm them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to get Taiwan back to the scale.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would like to get political integration as well, but the first thing is the first.
It will be best to wait until the 2012 presidential elections take place.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008 openly insisted on explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai has been gratefully welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as well as Su Tseng-chang, who fulfilled mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything to prove that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PPD candidates would have gone better unemployed if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present to the presidential elections.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulties in choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also make a awareness examination.
Mr. Ma’s valuations have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to make a campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet, as well as the local teams.
Large evidence from the PPD suggests that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Nominations for the Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Artist Revelation category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammy surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Revelation category.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammys rules according to which he must be an artist who has not brought to the market more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of said artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a great advance and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way towards Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated on the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters made honour with reason to Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favourites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are the veteran saxophone James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the teclista John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favourite strident in New Orleans and usual guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which by the rest tends considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk got a deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the big camera jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.
Nominations for the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Direction of Classical Albums
The classical music nominations for the 53th Grammy Awards include a mixture of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for five-movement piano and orchestra, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concert.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories that include orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classical producer category of the year includes five nominations: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classic music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphonic Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominated are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was released at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it on Mandolina Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from northern Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was nominated in the category of orchestra function, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The nominated instrumental solists include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the arpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominated vocal solists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval by the ordering committee
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local ordering committee after more than five hours of public testimonies, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it fosters terrorism and attacks.
However, the committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahá’u’lláh, of all religions,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in the Themecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
“The truth is that, as a American citizen, I am proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They speak very loud.”
“There are wonderful people in this valley.”
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” it is read in one of the comments.
“It’s another Planet of the Simmons with Mrs. Freedom Dead in the Sand.”
“America has fallen.”
The plans to build Islamic centers have triggered protests in other parts of the country, including near the Zero Zone, the New York area where the attacks of September 11, 2011 occurred.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
Its congregation of approximately 135 families has been living without trouble in the county of Riverside for years, but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would be lifted up to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
The opponents can still appeal the project before the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbium proposes the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be forms of life without the main elements they considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
“It can grow with phosphorus or arsenic.”
“This makes her something very peculiar, although little is missing to be a kind of life really ‘Alien’,” said Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday’s Science publication.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what more is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the discovery is important for the search for life on different planets from Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know the aspect it has.
The study focuses on a microbium discovered on Earth.
However, the call of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of alien life.
He did not.
What the discovery "so shows is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not done by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who directed the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it presents elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so I speculated that a microbium exposed to both could replace one by another.
“Arsenic is mostly toxic because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“But the arsenic is different enough so that it doesn’t work as well as the phosphorus, so it enters and, to say somehow, applies the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbium grows better with phosphorus, but the fact of demonstrating that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that it can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but never found an example that demonstrates that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early era of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
“Yes it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The kidnapped dogs missing in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, the Los Angeles county sheriff officials said on Thursday.
The four competing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met on Wednesday afternoon, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff department.
“The good news is that dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They have returned with their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore didn’t want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
“A research is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We are following a few tracks.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the furgonet and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops in the practically two-month tour that the couple performs participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in in the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the car just in front of the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs (a boxer child, a Terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the furgonet because they have a very thick palage and would be fresh.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard denounced the steal of the furgonete on Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to rush again, while MGM's restructuring achieves the final approval of the cut.
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the creditors' "pre-armed" plan to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, opening the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of movies and television programs.
The Thursday decision confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relance under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its account is contributing with $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The study's restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management necessary to order its finances, while struggling to be able to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and bankrupt business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few posters and no one willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, it returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillionary bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive some $4 million success fees.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-start production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual pizzarra of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-financed two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to concert a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to fund its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a study merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of their budget for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by,, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant melt in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bicycles of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump rows decorated with accounts, or approximately 48 Play-Doh rows.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to the last year.
In addition, while generally there are fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-driven toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are peluchy toys of the size of a cowboy who sing a note when their barricades are pressed.
A tightening equals a note, and a second tightening begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: Once you start pressing, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking the last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-changing games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative joined legs with wheels with blocking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a bag full of questions letters designed to turn a car walk into a session with a record of occurring self-correction exercises.
If you’re delighted to give your child your smartphone, here you’ll save three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games don't teach as efficiently as the Leapster Explorer ($ 70, from 3 to 12 years old), it's the first important point of the Leapster line, with a new and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game barely bigger than a box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in a row before time ends; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed words.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheels on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last on a line of microrobots driven by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As a urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the passage on a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people at his charge, issuing orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police officers of the urban order of China, feared and disappointed by their capricious energy measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
“Firmas!”
“Attention!”
Show them, he shouted, “How beautiful girls are!”
Four girls who barely passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and adjusted pants to attract attention.
Four pair of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair bound with blue and white rays moons.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
A city ordered that all new recruits have a degree degree.
The province of Guangdong changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating sights: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a dick snack cart, and observed it with the neck constantly broken for half an hour, until the ambulant seller picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, expressly chosen by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the tosca police a smoother, female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s infamous respect for these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to make the city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei Province inspectors killed a transit after they used their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a wastewater.
Last year, a manual of training for inspectors in Beijing was struck and published on the internet, in which it was described as effectively striking criminals without making them bleeding.
This year, an ambulant sandy seller from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street sellers.
"Chengguan has left a scarring in the government," China Daily, a national publication, regretted last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a truly meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a warning eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked if women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's warning asked for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial traits".
They should have a height above the average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years old.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a governmental website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc.”
Then comes the temperament “and the interior qualities”.
Women's chengguan are like flowerers, he said, and added, "In addition to being flowerers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese work announcements for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial traits.
If this means to be a bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disadvantaged or defigured should not appear.
“We can’t allow a cowboy or a cowboy to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrolls the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t believe that the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?” she asked with a sardonic look.
His co-working partner with hoyuelos, Xu Yang, 21 years old, said, “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also do not oppose their work on a determined time, they said, because they open up larger career ambitions that simply evacuate sellers in the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen ambulant sellers who throw themselves on foot or on a bicycle, trying to sell as many potatoes or cups of tofu as possible before being throwed.
“Mr. Wang, you have to leave.”
“We’ve told you many times!” said Ms. Xu as a seller escaped on foot, temporarily leaving her bike-trapped car with fideous garnitures.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studies marketing in his free hours.
It is very routine.”
One reason is that female officials lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
They can only threaten by denouncing the offenders to their men supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, shut down after the false rumor was spread that some Chengguan officials had murdered a seller.
More than a dozen Chengguan police officers or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were volcanoed or shot fire.
For now, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is barely guaranteed.
Only two streets from the quiet Baoguang Square, where women officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the shore rather than in a workshop, as the regulation requires.
The motorcycle owner was screaming.
The situation stopped for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, opened the way to the crushes to their vehicles and went quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white insignia given round to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators, men aged 40 or more, play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturality.
“Most of the time is the public who begins the struggle.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that the Department of Justice’s prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign for the criminal imputations that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobby for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Ensign faces, the Republican of Nevada who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on his affair had national titles last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after an entire year of investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Department of Justice had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him for this issue.”
The Department of Justice did not comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
The interviews, the email and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get lucrative work through lobby, to the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find jobs for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law to lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict that former state employees use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "this appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending customers investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious when accepting political trials after several major reverses for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to abandon the trial against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
The federal prosecutors are “clearly a coward,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws are not applied to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call more the next day, telling him that the department didn't want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acts according to the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering in details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which claims that a $96,000 payment from the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The election committee said it had not enough evidence to prove that money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which achieved work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave to Hampton.
A e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign cabinet chief, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "masking" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign asked for forgiveness to his voters and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has desires to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal to Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the court room.
Minutes a minute, they sent reports of the scary testimony via Twitter.
At the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children bound to their beds in a house that was caught fire.
On Thursday, the broadly followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official final, with the judge's imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have presented writings in the court that delineate the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative states that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force the appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair process,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’ main defense lawyer.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the media were "curefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the topic.
For decades, the appeal courts have acknowledged that covering celebrated cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic ruling of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that examined Mr. Hayes' condemnation half a century later could feel intrigued by the argument that new rules could be needed to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something unpredictable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason of concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report in which it was said that this was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might feel intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the court rooms could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics delineated by Hayes’ lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been damaged when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of the potential jury, showing them scattering photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jury have said they were scared by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that incorrectly had pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to delibate for a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But your arguments on the effect of the intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the last month archived verdict that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continuously threw the fire of the excitement about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and throughout the state.”
Your attention to Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, were a foolish vision that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appeal courts often felt attracted by the arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes’ lawyers are pressing for that complaint.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which revokes the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civism stretch a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, a little civism has been triggered this week in Washington.
Is it a prediction of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick turn to the party struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any advances on the major topics that should be discussed during the coming session.
But for what they all say, it was at least a courtesy discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that exist among the members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both sides are in a period of trial, surveying each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed party war.
The reason for which the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social aid, the two parties are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections wake up party passions, which then disappear.
That is good.”
In some issues, in particular those that are listed in the day order of the coming session, Republicans and Democrats have no other option than finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are overcome by the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, it is likely that there will be a commitment to expanding unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans can’t make them believe they’re in favour of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment subsidies for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these topics during the coming session, along with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to a continued bipartidism when the new 112th Congress is gathered in January.
He said, on the contrary, it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
“After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term, psychology will turn the situation to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
For more awareness the Republican leaders have about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they should try to fulfill their promises of cutting the state expenses and abolishing the new health law.
These party lines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions to the deficit committee’s recommendations, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut of expenses.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the hardest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have brought the issue of deficit into the public day order in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the chosen officials in the panel, suggesting that in tax issues there is, at least currently, few bases or desire for commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would the change cause?
the public opinion.
There are considerable evidence that, despite the partyism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the people’s reaction.
Anyone who considers that he is losing will probably change course and will seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partialism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and it seems that there is a greater ideological hole between Obama and Congress Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the merely prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find points in common in the issues that still divide them.
Filtered American Document Portraits Moscow as the Paradise of Corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a part of the savings and protection money that it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle enormous chantage systems, helping to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stretch of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority”, takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he was guilty for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the accusations of corruption over the years, and he has earned several claims for libelo on such accusations.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, he said: "It's a madness, a pattern, a discomfort."
According to the surveys, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it’s unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy’s report, and it’s unheard that foreign diplomats are the ones who do that.
“Moscow city government’s direct bonds with crime have led some to call it ‘disfunctional’, and to claim that the government works more as a cleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘match’ or protection) that transcends the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
“The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow.”
“Luzhkov is at the highest.”
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level.”
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects the money from the bigger companies, and that the police point to the small stores.
A source, according to the report, "explained that Moscow commercial owners understand that the best thing is to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their business closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy's note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
“In his struggle against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrates,” said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
“But he is part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (the countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late at Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be guilty of the weaknesses of Moscow, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed with CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously for a revelation that claimed that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a weakly enlightened concrete classroom, with shrinked and scattered walls, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
“There’s everyone loves Ta Mok.”
“He was a good leader and worried about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the Carnicer" for his brutality during the Red Jemers government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Red Jemers fortress in northeastern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers ran before the government, long-established loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to publicly face the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemers to the sons of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemers, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into the Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is generating divisions within the families.”
During the Government of the Red Jemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or excess work.
When in 1979 Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the regime and its troops fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that rindied in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemers fighters began to desert towards the government, culminating in Ieng Sary’s surrender in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Jemers fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Red Jemers retained their local administrative positions in exchange for depositing their weapons, the racist soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
“These people have obtained few profits after the surrender,” said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sister Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Jemers was fine,” he said.
“Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone.”
“But now life is difficult because we have to supply ourselves.”
The current Court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to begin trial against Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Jemer minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but he has not said if he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, a 64-year-old, who was a district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma Prade, a project in which it is believed that thousands of forced workers have died.
During a recent afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a land road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows over the resecated paste, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She said that if the court called her, she would not be presented.
“Camboya is in peace and stable,” he said.
“If there are more processes, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who dismissed the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Camboya must hide a hole and burial the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
“The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to unite the broken pieces again,” he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed at Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemers, despite the city’s bond with the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people that the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too bad herbs and covered with removed plastic bags leads to a black hole rectangle covered by an oxidated roof of sheet.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone seller on the edge of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray for him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus to give up its qualified uranium reserves for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of unreturn last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus were carried out in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weapons from a Belarusian investigation facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47-national Nuclear Security Summit presided by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously a good achievement to assure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically skilled uranium for weapons) and low enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
“This is our raw material... we won’t make dirty bombs, and we won’t sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, it’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in achieving an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was complicated, as the material had been slightly radiated.
Officials said he was charged on a special train that travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and removal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus the research facility with low-enrichment uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on the Reduction of Global Threat, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen the confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of skilled uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tight for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s sharp repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distinction.
“While the progress in these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central topic for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
Spanish government fails to repair CIA flights
The Spanish government did not report the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected by the documents filed (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that then vice-president first of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to “be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on the foreign aircraft that pass through Spain.”
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega occurred.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council’s report “has taken the Government of Zapatero out of play” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They simply want to be informed” to avoid being “pilled disappointed,” Aguirre tells on a cable.
Also then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "will give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Defense Ministry on the flights of the CIA.
“These reports do not contain any incriminatory elements or sensitive information,” the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern for the “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors”, rather than for the declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
“This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments,” Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 in a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this commented that "although the Spanish judges are rabiesfully jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflammatory rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed concern for the PP’s action on this issue.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize any indications that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government,” she said.
The parricida confessed complaining on the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman talked about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is “Muki” on the network.
With this surname, which she employs from small, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natural of Noia, the coruñés people from which she is originating.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstruct through testimonies from his family members.
The young Galician, 30 years old, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrial man.
It lasted a year.
When he was left, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never allowed him to get the DNA test.
He soon met another boyfriend.

When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitous, because I have come to work."
“When I said it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not to have freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, she talks about a message to the mobile that she just received: "I want you to return this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains: "If she doesn't like to leave the kid with my mother, I'll pick it up when she's back," she says.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I go there, but I will only be until the 19, because the 20 I have to present myself to a job so that I don't miss it."
He says that if everything goes well, he takes him to his first-born.
“He will be with whom he must, that is, with me, and never in life I will think to leave it again with no one other than my mother,” doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July there is another post.
When you click it, it is supposed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and allegedly was murdered on the 10, is dead.
“César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other.”
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the site a little, but on the other hand he’s going to class almost every day.”
It is about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to a summer class, and so I save a little cangur pasta."
17 comments and complaints.
“A very big kiss of Caesar, who asks me when you come.”
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to go."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes so he can learn Catalan."
De Víctor, his current partner, has one: “He advances me money.”
On the internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe MySpace, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the excarcerator."
“Terror to the Galician (epígrafe)”.
The last man who lived with her, keeps jury, declares her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to believe that everything has happened because he didn’t tell him that he was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday in the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees in Menorca.
Official lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "not having had the intention of causing any harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathroom and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defendant and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the 28-N results, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view placed in the general because, be ahead or not, the perspectives are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles what it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalonians obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general, while in the 2006 autonomous, the figure ascended to 316.222.
On Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
Ofining this trend to the rise, which has been nutritious of a PSC vote transvase and the fidelization of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would win also four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 members (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is kept, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in its releve at the forefront of the Barcelona Deputy, one of the administrations that most budget manages - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popularists coincide in the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be disclaimed that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to protagonize the turning in the Tarragonese capital, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros,ins very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met in several occasions.
The popular have grown also in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell supplies thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, among them "Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author this last of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the “operation Kampai” has been “debilitated” the al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at international level and, “thus, its operational capacity.”
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combaters” can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The distant cell is not the only that the jihadist network had operative in Europe, therefore in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not excluded that on EU territory are carried out in the coming days strikes similar to the developed in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those who directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network – part of it was hit in 2009 – was primarily theft of passport tourists who fulfilled the requirements marked by the so-called “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is highlighted that, at the moment, no data has been found that links the detained in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it can be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended with the lives of 106 people.
Police have taken over abundant documents.
Parliament calls for a fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had an opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investidura as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that summarizes in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and prescinding from filo-soberanist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalonians went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he has obtained 18 members in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to want, since the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise to abstain in the voting of investidura.
From a possible understanding with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the conversations that these days hold Mas with the rest of political leaders are made in key Catalan.
And as regards the president of the PP, to support an investidura “there will be to park all the sovereign and independentist discourses”, as well as the economic concert – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their stake to weaken the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax on successions and donations.
Of the details of the negotiation on Mas's investment will be occupied, by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Geriatric says the deaths were not due to "feat of measures"
Olot's center owners don't disclose that their celler killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly who was in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, compared accompanied by the center’s letter, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that “the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible” of the deaths but “the legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the processal situation of civilian responsible.”
And it is that in addition to the social disgrace that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the celler in time, the great threat for La Caritat now covers the form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then it has not ceased to kill.
The judge already pointed out in the auto that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - ancient patients of the geriatric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the dead but that, taking into account the age and the pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied yesterday this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
The La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the case there is no single indication that there has been an imprudent action by any other person other than the accused himself.”
The already baptized "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center has access to the medications.
Insulin scratches and sedant cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his endeavour to relieve the suffering of the internists, used to kill them.
But the analyses that are being done in the laboratory will be the ones that will have to clarify if Vila doesn’t lie and sought for its first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she abrased them inside giving them loose as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they don’t give credibility to the manifestations of the celler, neither even to the number of confessed murders, which do not discard that it is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That’s why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted suddenly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differentials have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not also underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What has occurred yesterday is own of an illicit market that, just as it explodes, is recovered but motivated by closing of short and very speculative positions.
Institutional investors will lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the public debt purchase plan by inefficient and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in time and leaving only unlimited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis we hope that they extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly lease with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue with your bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the generated expectations they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with the withdrawal of liquidity measures, let God assist us!
Like in their May meeting in which they said they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be reliable and persistent.
In May it announced the basuca on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Last week, the leaflet of letters to a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
However, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sense after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been made public.
The figures are estimated to be about 10 billion short-term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension face to the next Summit of Chiefs of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary a political commitment that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all touch the same partitura.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will approve on Friday the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bonus lease that will be benefited by the Trichet effect so we hope it will be solved with strong demand and help dissolve the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Aid would be a self-immulation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, to charitable rates and you close access to the sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of the Caesar’s woman, “in addition to being it, look it.”
Love can be.
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicily's board requested by his children
The temporal does not match in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "null of full right", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to make their majority valid and make themselves with the management bodies of the signature owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are affinating the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute for the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding to the company does not seem willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the El Enebro government bodies.
From his administration council he was discarded by five of his seven sons who were named administrators in the shareholders' assembly of January 18th of this year and whose complaint is recorded in the Mercantil Register.
The Judicial Board of El Enebro for the next day 16, called by the Magistrate of the Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the trunes in the heart of the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, through processal argue, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18," according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for, once the board is held, to proceed to its complaint by considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate would call for a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, patrimonial society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the profit over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the underlying question that the judge must decide once the appeal on the appeal is held, for which there is no indicated date yet.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull dropped into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this selected speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived scuderia and, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the straight final of the championship all bet for the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without overwhelming the skill as pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propulses his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the “secret weapon” that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for very distant purposes from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thereby avoiding faults and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s photographic cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and take into effect “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the scuderies in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in his team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team today work 180 high-qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications in the bullets.
The CEO of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull bólids with the exception of the engine, which is Renault’s entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as maximum in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-tech factory to design and produce its bólids in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
It is two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret.”
The staff for this task rises to 580 people, including their two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose contest is inestimable and their notoriety is zero are hidden.
Factory technology chief Steve Nevey says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wheels contributed 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology summs 85% of success, while drivers contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as they are “unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes in Barcelona.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimarca centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as an example the remodeled store located in the Gran Vía barcelonese, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The U.S. group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install stores will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it would be a franchise system and highlighted that the exclusive network of stores aims to “better customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP’s computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that sometimes can take up to two days."
“This system is designed specifically for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” Helena Herrero said.
Sabadell betting to steal a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Bank Sabadell's delegated counselor, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and vaticines the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it predicts a collapse of the interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with increases of commissions and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will be in force for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers – 700,000 if discounted those who can leave the bank – their great subject matter pending, since so far it had mimiced more to SMEs and companies than to retail customers.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet for productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction of costs as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks dare in these times to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has transtook all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his director plan Optima, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand a further year.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficile and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the passive war – which penalizes the margins – is decreasing, the price of the risk primes that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity are moving already to the price of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the grip, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of the differentials – see Five Days of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend of the bank is now "to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s director plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "there will be required greater sizes."
“The next year everything will move,” he said.
It states that the capital needs are "a lot rising" and does not disclose that some Spanish financial entity enters in red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supply the market in the capture of funds before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary shutdown of the markets, it remained important to what some banks vaticine as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which amortises the crisis.
The CECA discharges a second wave of mergers in the boxes
CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that a wave of savings boxes fusion will occur and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings boxes started, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that this new wave of operations will be produced.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Cívica Bank cannot be said to be a second round, what there are is adjustments."
"The majority is completely made; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have been done already and tuteled by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated so much as well," the directive said.
In statements during a breakfast from the Association of Directors and Executive Officials of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest speed possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to occur in the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Passing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion volumes of assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities to 62% so that they are much bigger to meet Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of quite unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said on Thursday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed those who put it in judgment a “knowledge deficiency”.
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic context, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of the financial entities and the savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "importantly" and that "go to the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank went out very well stop from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or deletion of the 426 euros of aid to unemployment, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has added criticism to Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Merkel’s position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which collides with that of keeping the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
In front of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible outputs to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, though now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a re-design of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigorousness, fines to the transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments for some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed it should be done (financial rigor and public finance stability plans), and what their European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel penosely extended the decision to save Greece.
It was then subject to fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published opinion were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the EU reform process that enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has traced a red line that doesn’t think to cross.
And it is telling us all that, although now it is necessary to take measures with which you may not agree very much, from that date the former functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare payments suspended and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply won’t tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we would make it wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they require is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences leave the way to greater tranquillity.
And let us take advantage of the opportunity window they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood so and his double manifest (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis that there is to be order at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has traced there is, and it doesn’t seem that they are going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too stumbled of less serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Treats like Alonso and Ramos before Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion urged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match disputed on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether such behavior is or not anti-sport and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As well known, in the absence of a few minutes to end the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when taking straight faults to provoke the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned with two matches the team's coach, José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the case related is due to the fact that it has been protagonized by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its hymn presumes nobleness and honor, and that in occasions passed has fines its players for analog acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate turns around whether that type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions it is committed fraud of law; since, in fact, they are actions respecting the sports regulation, but they seem to elude its meaning.
The question passes by examining the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that sports spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which it is highlighted with the clean game is to avoid the team of the infringing players to take advantage of the opposite team in an unfair way, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that he did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, since his violation of the rules was not made hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious to thus receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and pleasantly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders obtain in the intended faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to constate that the rival is not placed in a disadvantaged situation, nor is it gained in the same match, since obviously the result of the action implies leaving the team with less players.
And this is also not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, since the team can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this action the players meet a sanction match and pass to the second card cycle, in which the suspension by card accumulation occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it’s not so clear that it’s an advantage.
In the end, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In the case it occupies us, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without sorting the punishment or escaping from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and the way the transmission of the direction of provoking them was carried out.
The damage caused to the sports principles by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture group Christmas dinners at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the days 16 and 17.
They proliferate the self-trained celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turn and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that due to the crisis have plunged into an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To end complicating accounting, the calendar of this year (at falling the Christmas on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result until the date of an avalanche of dinner reserves for top days (the 16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As it has already happened since 2008, when the stages of smooth cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary issue.
To avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the counture, some and others require battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Gremi, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal, today, does not dare to vaticine how the celebrations of this month will be.
“People think about it a lot before booking.”
“He wants to go out but has the warnings on the issue of prices,” he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", adds, and reminds that customers tend to drop a staircase with the crisis, so that the gap around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments it is found the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded adapting their menus to the counture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more anticipated reservation, even from the beginning of November.
“We’ve done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
In AN Group, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, optimists remain after detecting a rise in the invoicing from the second half and good, although concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
The group's sources highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that pre-selebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that again invite their employees and the feeling that the group volume is somewhat greater.
By the patronal Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, confesses in starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that in conjunction the reserves are "animated", although the customers "go to the maximum".
That yes, the illusion for the celebrations has not gone down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises U.S. concerns
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
On the edge of the clarificing and juicy details they offer about the content of the conversations and the thoughts of American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than going to rise, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in case of an attack – is one of the main reasons for disappearance in Washington.
This is stated by Pakistani ambassador Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then National Security counselor James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear installations to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The elevated number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the U.S., but also by Russia, as a proliferant and reason to keep the guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The most novelty of the documentation filed by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly smaller cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high pace of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons production.
A office of the embassy in May, which quotes the communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", says: "Transparency is often inexistent; aid offers remain unresponse or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, constates that “although the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The chief of Wikileaks
Obama has appointed a senior responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new filters.
Interpol is issuing a red warning in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure about the facts.
Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
It’s not new, it’s on November 20th.
And it does not have to do with the last filtering of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Additionally, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens’ lawyer says that “the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.”
It was the 20th day when the international police body based in Lyon (France) dictated the order on request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called network notice free way to proceed to an arrest -- which must be carried out by the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed.
The movement has indigned Assange’s lawyers, who posted a letter yesterday denouncing the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has shown himself willing to answer by video conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“This looks like a hunting, not a legal persecution,” the mission says.
As the world seeks him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in an unknown, but not silent path.
On Monday, she gave from an indetermined place an interview to the director of the Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which she asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible to order U.S. diplomats to spy in the UN violating international treaties that the U.S. has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation petition “ridicle and absurd.”
“I’m not completely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents from fleeing.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to restore Assange’s importance contradicts opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the Congressman who will from January preside the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, has asked the State Department to study the possibility to include Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help.”
More far has yet gone Tom Flanagan, a counselor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government who filters the information is guilty of betrayal and whatever the execution would be a too kind punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guides to the affinity of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the enzyme internal rebellion in the ERC rows, without north for the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his thunder of resignation is insufficient for the affinity of ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can absolutely cause the head breaks he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the Left leader will try to win the new critics with guides that allow him to blind up until municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
by hand, not by hand lifted.
If the carodists want to vehicle a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of repressions.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as well as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without precising percentages, that it would not be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
The victims of Carod demand the president something more than put his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they don’t have enough majority to force demissions, they’ll try to agree with the executive a roadmap from here to May.
For this, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to vote of the National Council on the 18th day.
His intention is to advocate Puigcercós in exchange that he promises to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011, something the summit already gives by fact.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” damages stability and its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty traps from doors to the inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that conseller in functions Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació gave by fact that the leader will be refreshed "in exchange for various goals".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., to include new faces that come from the affinity sector to Carod.
The second can be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC once liquidates assemblyism as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, who has already battle in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion left the commission to the direction to review assemblyism at a specific congress on the reform of statutes.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal marriage of the last years did not advise to address the matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it can be a good time to restart it and try to close it forever.

According to the count of MILLENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILLENIO State of Mexico.

Chinains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country at the COP16 said that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and to re-convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, its country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work jointly with the international community on this issue.
He said China’s climate change strategy is divided into four rubles: dialogue; capacity building; institutions building and pilot program support.
In all those rubles there have been advances, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which collects the objectives set in terms of reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with state and local authorities to the energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction goals.
In addition, it has been abundant, they are in motion or have already concluded various multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government, and by governments from other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Program, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also ongoing, another for the change of incandescent focuses by savings and another for mitigation and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, said that China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he exposed, the emission per capita of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historic contribution to pollution.
Also, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and is expected to do another so much to the year 2020.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what his right entails.
The PAN national leader, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what his right complies.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken in the local area.
“This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission.”
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, where appropriate, via a claim to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it’s not time to think about 2012 and that it’s never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the next 4 and 5 December internal elections, in which he will have to choose his successor.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiation table, at least not for now, it was a approach for local elections that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The panist leader precised that the PAN supports 71 years of dialogue, so "we don't scare the internal competition; the counter "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, therefore he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
“I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to deliver the office of the party’s president.”
He predicted that the repentance that the party recorded in the past 4 July elections will be reflected in the upcoming disputes, although "it's not time yet to think in 2012."
“For now it’s about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.”
In this framework, he highlighted that the three governments emanated from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason of observation throughout the country, therefore that “many hopes, desires are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations.”
By being questioned about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of his four years of government, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the sexenies of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them begin to defend; let it go out of the closet," he said.
He said that the Federal Executive holder can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Audit, because in the country there is no murder or much less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act law is the appropriate thing, call your senators and staff to approve this legislation," Trump tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that approving the Dream Act is the appropriate thing, call your senators and instances to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” she says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the expansion of the Bush era tax cuts and government financing is approved.
Such blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects law, President's spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been solved, a schedule for the rest of the projects will be fixed.
“I think there’s a lot of time...”
“We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year.”
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "debat closing vote" for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, remained in the country over the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the parties require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, in moments when party organizations of the project are protagonizing an intense cabildeo to guarantee the approval of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the Dream Act supporters require to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to give back to the initiative.
Among the Republicans most cut off are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but have declared they won’t support it in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his posture at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Literature puts the finger on the wound.
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants made gala of the narrative.
"This of Sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected from me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitles of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "it puts us in press," the Argentine writer sweetly spectated the public, mostly of young people, who gave a quote at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where they participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would then define as a great tale, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the "lake" is, goes from physician to physician, from whom he does not get answers although yes clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist it comes convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it is my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that it is cry is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the cry is the real open, the symbolic is the scarring."
The protagonist suspired relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it doesn't exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the tricks of the language should go very overwhelmed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narration he titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a moment is discovered.
With bricks of magical realism, he tells a famous witch, who the same touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a damn, narration that turned to speak then America, the great novel to which he did not miss from the beginning his own chronists who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what the captains conquerors told.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made joke of the fictitious witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise it would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination to which it lacked until the pudding."
However, he highlighted "there are the crazy and the foolish who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It is called the “Cervantine Tradition”.
“Because of your inheritance, we are what is told.”
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero acclaimed and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL took place with her round table The Finger on the Wrath.
The Cuban-Puerto Rico pointed its way to the great wound of social violence that passes through its country – and shares Latin America – product of the disputes of trafficking and drug sale.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs will close a thin commitment that of course is not premeditated,” he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a “chemical reaction” of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "on that finger in the writer's committed wound".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that rounds in dogmatisms, forgetting “that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of reality we have to matise: and matise means many times putting the finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without matis and annoying also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had heights in his career, but has known to reach the decisive series in three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had heights in his career, but has known to reach the decisive series already in three occasions, although so far it has gone in white and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended consoling with the subcampeon medal, a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the Opening 2002 Tournament, when he carried the rides of Morelia with which he fell by global 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with global 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Now with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenary Tournament 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reverse, since his team ended 2-2 against the choricers after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty tanda he put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same luck, he seeks to take off the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to get champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affair to which I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," Timonel said when he questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
"The only teaching we can have is that until the arbitrator silbes the final we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the rail, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to go out running and I think that's a teaching, until the match is not finished we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shoots, something that doesn’t bother him, because he trusts his players: “One never seeks to get to the tanda of penalties, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there’s no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a badly played fate, sometimes for the nerves or anxiety of having the title in the hands, but it went us, that left us something for this final that we hope not to get to that instance.”
Roman has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion technician and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
I am changing the rules for visa.
People will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 the procedure for the processing of a visa in the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will be changed.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service (ASC) centers before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspirants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to concert the date, another payment to process the visa application and another more for the messaging service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for requested visa cases (including temporary workers visa) and $390 for traders and investors visa.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Office, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their footprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second date to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Also, those who apply for visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces extraterrestrial life discovery
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce a astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 in the NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citating the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will cause an impact on the search for alien life", which raised speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures alongside us and in hostile environments that thought themselves uninhabited, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbium that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an atmosphere that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that “yes there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will reveal the real scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
At the conference will participate the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the greatest moon of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, convergence and opposition 'block' pattern
With reforms to Congress' Organic Law, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when a opposition block emerged in Congress, headed by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' to the Chamber.
Before giving start to the installation session of the 60 Legislatura, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform to the Organic Law, since they excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it gives start to 'bipartidism', because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four Deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their character of vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms in an institutional way is the political marginality of part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they don’t have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition ended.
“From here it came (the opposition coalition), it’s what I look at, because we’re excluded, from any decision, nor want they to have the political deference of considering the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that the Congress after being monopoly, now be "duopoly."
“It’s not the spirit to the reform of the law that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
To begin, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and are talking with other colleagues and colleagues so that they are more.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'botin' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a match, now it is divided between two.”
Patrón Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiation tables.
“It’s not for cupular agreements, it’s left out to 5 that we’re probably going to make 9 members, it saves the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we’ve decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiation table, that’s the topic that in the reform they made they agreed, we’re out and we’re not agree with that reform.”
Selling $200,000 more for the "Supplier"
Pay the Municipality of Mazatlán another cheque to the questioned owner of the electric material company.
A cheque more by little more than 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electric material company, rises to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to pay".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been is the total that is still awarded and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been purchased, you’re simply paying what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as it is marked by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The above, after 25 July, Noroeste published a review of the checks that the City Council expands to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he charged checks for more than 3 million pesos.
We need to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Comerciants of the Golden Zone, recalled that in different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the disorder and take it back to the nearby.
“Politicians don’t know what it is to close a business one day and don’t have an idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise they’t do the works in this way in so much time and without the proper planning.”
Hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling only in the corrective," he said.
“We are looking forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area that must beined, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadite of Mazatlán.
“Today, for the tourist to come doesn’t just depend on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
"There has not been given proper attention and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, ordered and that be attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that you will have to order first, clean up and make us online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, proposed that the MPs assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A worthy and free labour legislation between parties and the state Executive demands the Mazatlán business sector, because there is a convulsion Sinaloa that faces big problems.
Since yesterday it has been installed the 60 legislature, integrated by seven political forces, 19 MPs of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Party New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partialism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly launched 40 members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Synaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is a custom that they make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival comparses of the rulers and the leaders of parliamentary fractions.”
Therefore he spoke that they must certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that take the Governor in turn forward.
“We want them to come to do a worthy job and above all committed to society and the sectors because they were the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow foster the generation of jobs.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he revises within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
“I have understood that it is the second secretariat in the state with a lower budget and it is incongruent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agro industry.”
In addition to that it is required to label resources to detonating tourist projects and that they help to give security to the state and in the updating to the Alcohols Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Wizard King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to satisfy their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chivo.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel don’t lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colony Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father has no fixed job.
“For sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn’t have chamba, but we sell mandarina and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
“He told me (José Alfredo), ‘I would like this monster,’ but I told him ‘we’ll see a son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be the ideal thing.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a couple of size five and a half or six would be of a lot of help.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Crowned Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se Se
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was carried out.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four pounds of hachis, money and production equipment have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the Sherbrooke court in the hours following their arrest.
They could face the accusations of Cannabis production, possession with the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted a year.
“It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the detentions,” said Mr. Ruel.
About 70 agents from the Quebec Strie Security Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department were involved in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration.
The conservative bill that, according to the government, should solve the problem of the carried patterns of clandestine migrants, will surely face a large opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I rely primarily on the letter.”
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you step," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the MPs after the weekly summit of the Caucus.
The liberals defend that the draft law in its current form, which would allow to arrest up to a year any person from a ship identified as the transport of clandestine immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he points to the wrong white.
“We are against and, as it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we’ll already see what the Government does,” Mr. Duceppe said.
NPD’s criticism on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticism that indicates that her party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
“Neodemocrats agree that measures will be taken against the prisoners of the clandestine fathers and that’s what we intend with another draft law, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprison children for a minimum of a year,” Chow explains.
The immigration minister, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of making case omission of the will of the Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell the MPs that they don’t tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a fool.”
“They expect Canada to take a firm measure,” Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has communicated to the QMI agency that the Government would request the celebration of a vote so that each Deputy to oppose will explain afterwards before its electors.
The new unity does not reach unanimity.
Although Jean Charest had announced the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, numerous observers continue to ask for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is a matter since January last year.
The Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Thus, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one.
It is worth saying that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services in Quebec held last October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of the joke” and as “a last-minute crazy solution.”
Minister Dutil, on his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ president, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest stands up to avoid the creation of this investigation committee, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a research committee is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead point, he suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general interventor to conduct an investigation on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the general interventor,” he concludes.
He also considers that Quebec could grant the interventor the same powers as a commissary, thus allowing him to force the persons to testify.
The creation of a permanent square is not the only project in charns in the Charest Government.
Quebec also asks Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it is better adapted to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Operation Spring 2001 related to moters groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored due to the strong rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon a earthquake occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two homes have been evacuated.
On the night, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road was flooded.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, various regions recorded a strong rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now to Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 mm of rain.
Since these precipitationes are added to the snowfall that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will break down.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall has led to some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, strong rain has dragged a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residents have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit continues to alert and watch the situation closely, security counselor Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, on its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the grown strengths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blamed Dupont
Quebec radio presentator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reverse before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements in relation to social assistance and about Haitians, as well as for his rough language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an indubidely negative representation of the Haitians and a gross language that should not be used in the broadcasts during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made on emissions spread between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
The presenters should communicate reliable and not cheating data.
In connection with the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the committee members have come to the conclusion that the message was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes discussed in 'Dupont le midi' have treated a delicate topic in an equitable and adequate way."
Therefore, any guilt has been dismissed.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had protagonized a media confrontation that had raised numerous reactions.
CHOI’s presentator said he had not done any donations to help the Haitians because he couldn’t know with certainty whether the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an indebidly negative representation of the Haitians.
“I’ve already completed my three-day suspension there up.”
“My file is clean for a year and a half,” the presentator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of gross language.
In any case, the radio chain CHOI-FM has collaborated “even more than required.”
The consequences will be minimal for the issuer, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of the highest hearing within three days.
King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, which stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box, runs to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fighting everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the ground game involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the company UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai box categories,” he explained.
“I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.”
“They will invite the athletes who have finished among the first four places in the last world championship in each category.”
“In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto.”
“In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended in eighth place.”
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition.”
“At this step, I’ll be the first this time or the next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fingers and feet, as well as throw the opponents to the ground.
The confrontations originally take place on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of fighting is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to keep a competition in his career, he will surely go to the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” the sympathetic boy explains.
“It’s like the equivalent to the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“He who has won me is a true professional,” he says.
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
“The winners of the semi-finals are faced in the final of their category.”
"After that, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
$450 million in non-contracts
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a previous public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the recourse to corporate consortiums raises a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition.”
“It is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly,” Quebec party member Sylvain Simard said in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question at the National Assembly because, as he says, he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that a collusion with this contract had occurred.
“I begin to get tired,” he protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a “dishonest” and “with lack of rigor.”
He said that the “minimum” would be that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without the competition being played; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the technical counseling sector is being undergoing an investigation in the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec market record allows you to identify more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, i.e. Dessau.
As regards the Energy Gerance consortium, the Minister Normandeau highlighted that “the James Bay territory responds to a particular work-hand dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s.”
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
“If you respond to an offer and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the sector’s players and tell them: we’ll negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.”
“But the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people,” Mr. Laporte said.
The contract granted to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between the year 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has achieved 22 contracts, Génivar has achieved 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they rise to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,1564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are “good-known of the Liberal Party of Quebec.”
The Minister Normandeau has laid down that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "financing it", before precising that it is rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. the "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer barely trusts the stakeholders of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse.The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even brings his commitment.
Even if it has increased consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products in 2010, Quebecs seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the ecologist advertising of the companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are “ecorresponsible,” the Barometer said.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecs take the politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information about responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently sustained by one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the lacunes and the doubtful character of the information make 46% of consumers desire this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Moreover, one-third of Quebecs say they are also confident in the alleged yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given priority to purchases in the shops of their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food products cultivated in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be of doors (from their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecs indicated that they had used public transport or shared car to defend their ecologist principles.
Moreover, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavior survey, which just completed its first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which they have asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were expecting a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex at the Saint-Laurent bulevar and return him their true cinéfila vocation, did not get what they asked.
The government has agreed to engage in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution in advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been reviewed to the bottom.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister of St-Pierre.
He received a recent report a decade ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely rejected.
Remember that the Association of owners of cinema and cinematic complexes in Quebec opposed a direct state investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, argumenting that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done it with other cinema rooms.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are calling for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has been carrying for ten years the charge of the film of author in its locals of the complex, after funding its own construction, which could justify a withdrawal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is patented in Montreal and eXcentris had known how to fidelize its clientela.
The company Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, push for a private financing campaign, hoping to gather $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project movies on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27, projecting the precious Xavier Beauvois film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini hasn’t contacted Le Devoir again and we don’t know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The Canadian wave is lifted up.
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers as the complex of the Canadians with respect to the Americans, but reflect at the same time the feeling of their superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think of the U.S.-Canadian relations when they’re going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details that really substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is, during a full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
“Maybe political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, instead of leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 campaign on free trade),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it.”
The ambassador has even more difficulties in understanding this “summing silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, I think, the ability of a candidate, of a party, and even more, of the leader of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting.”
This sense of importance can also be observed by the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion,” Mr. Breese writes.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from replacing the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to do energetic interrogations.
During his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
“The Secretary agreed to review the file.”
Finally, we can mention that the minds in relation to the WikiLeaks site have been heated.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the man responsible for this mass escape should be "assassinated."
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is being echo.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a renewal plan of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a amount that corresponds practically to one-third of the additional decrease that should be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the set of large concrete projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent lamps, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact lamps or, even better, by electroluminescent diodes lamps (DEL or "LED" in English), a large part of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GEI emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GEI emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, there should be a further decrease of 5 Gt of that amount to stabilize, before 2020, the temperature rise by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In the incandescent lamps, 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact lamps, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED lamps, the energy consumption is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact lamps last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED lamps, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume an 80% less energy than an incandescent lamp, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new lamps can also work with reostates and emit very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed their reservations in relation to fluocompact lamps, as they contain mercury and should be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emission on the planet are not the fluocompact lamps, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is broken with the incandescent lamps.
Only in the United States, these power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion dollars.
Costa de Marfil is looking forward to the announcement of the election results
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa del Marfil, as the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
He asks all the parties of Costa de Marfil and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
Around forty minutes before the deadline ended, the Chairman of the ICC had commented on television that the committee "continued working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the world has multiplied the demands that the ICC finally proclaims the name of the second round winner between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has the abolition by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebel of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Costa de Marfil, said the FN electors' intimidation maneuver in the north of the country had disguised the followers of the president coming out of going to vote.
All the election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
Now, the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "inacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that he has filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the lead to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class of Marfil Coast that they could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account the ultramar departments), as indicates the corrected data with the temporary variations (CVE) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
The data of the second quarter have been confirmed, a 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and a 9.7% with the DOMs.
In a year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, be or not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not work.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO direction.
On its part, a slight increase in unemployment among people of advanced age has been recorded, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points both in three months and in a year), i.e., 482.000 people over 50 years old, a figure that rises to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only an unemployment stability has been recorded among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with a 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and a 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has since 2006 not published the monthly unemployment rate, after a polemic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation on allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, malversation of funds and public goods, coverage, active corruption, influence trafficking and munition possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and will answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of repressible acts, another thing is to demonstrate them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his compare, a document to explain.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close persons, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his customer has done is to take care of the wheels he has to manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he doesn’t know anything about it, as writer Simon says.
In the framework of this file, he is being investigated as well since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for malversation of funds and complicity, but he has been left in conditional freedom and has prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
“My customer has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him.”
“The instructor’s magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has left him free,” his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin, said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "influence trafficking and passive corruption."
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "sustraction and malversation of public goods by a person devoted to public service" and "complicity in malversation of public funds", respectively.
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “encoverment of abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts that affected Cork.
The researchers suspect their societies are serving to whiten the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research is focused especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a wastehouse in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marsella (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syrian mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", has had in wave the public in France, has alerted the diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attentive look of the US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Eliseo has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “rehen” crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French young woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris has the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage the cases of imprisonment."
Eliseo’s strategic counselor, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk to the U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
The French method is explained.
They advise the Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained by force in Iran.
“Do noise,” they say, “continuely dissolve” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate liberation”.
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more frequently.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, “the silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory maneuveres.”
Mr. Richier added that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: the take of hostages for political chantage.”
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day he will refuge at the French Embassy) “will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money” (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, she points out that the Eliseo anticipates other prison crises, a phenomenon that “will increase”.
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
The following information is disclosed: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illegal traffic of delicate electronic materials to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks of procurement of material for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand’s dismissal is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Will Iran be free in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
The Eliseo, he says, not only "has been tremendously surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot cancel the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the “strict” surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Eliseo counselor marked a telephone number, hanged and, then, informed the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a building in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Eliseo does not escatima in efforts, uses communications and "flows" organized in the media to make it believed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions “the media ‘blitz’ of French officials.”
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr. Assad, the ambassador to Paris is questioned.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials confess in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document discusses the reasons that have led the Eliseo to give foot to this fiction.
The great efforts of communication “have the objective of validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which “in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, was just taught of premature and desmerited.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian paper,” Paris tries “to show Syria the praises that it can harvest if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The aim also consists in “setting the seed of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Naturally, we don't know if the Syrians have done something or not."
“But anyway, we’ve been grateful.”
“At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "de Cenicienta" that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to the Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, according to representatives from the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then it’s hard for them to study at school and take a normal life throughout the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement.
The government also proposes to ask companies to limit daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request it, he added.
In addition, it will put at the disposal of anyone requesting free computer programs that allow to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and the newspapers regularly report about various facts linked to an intense use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA executive committee designates the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups on Thursday, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to the primary over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that formed part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the head of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are on the game in a World Cup.
Transactions between backstage, therefore, may last until the last minute.
However, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American candidates (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the European Parliament (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, the fountain of football, which just hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added linen to the fire on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has shown evidence to three influential members of the European Parliament, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust the FIFA and shame the British officials, who have launched an intense lobbying over the past few weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the coup given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJOO.
Will this intense activity be enough to recover the brightness of England before the European Parliament?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strong points thanks to its stadium, already ready, its experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Copa de Europa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could throw down their ambitions.
The possible repressals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they get is to give points to Russia, becoming an outsider of weight despite the lagoons in their candidacy (stadios, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct alusion to the accusations of the British press against the members of the European Parliament.
“They’re pulling out their dirty traps, trying to commit them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The world’s first economic power and headquarters of FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to bring advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the grant of the 2026 World Cup to China, fiercely desired by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain unlikely for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be damaged by the weakness of TV payments (depending on the hour difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for the FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle really had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he had doubts.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less.
One mandate in Eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
to one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed he didn’t discard a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "in some point in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you deal with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked a certain revolt.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president just indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited to two the number of five-year mandates.
It simply transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he speaks of the presidential elections, with a joke tone, in meetings of this kind.
“In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,” he had released in July 2009.
In another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think what will come after."
His claims of yesterday don’t bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it’s not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
More than the opposite; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is obvious is what leads many people from the PS to claim that the battle will be organised earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad surveys.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46 percent against 44 percent), according to BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the topic," the Prime Minister's environment immediately and prudently reacted.
“If you think you can lose, you won’t be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
“He will always think he can win,” corrected Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to clarify the outcome modalities of the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy transactions that should be completed by the end of the year.
Due to the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt emission institution will surely not be allowed to be so perentory if it does not want to risk worsening a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
In a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the European state’s debt crisis.
He didn’t want to say if he considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. increasing his state bond purchase program.
“I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues.”
This evening, in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the Chairman of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the program for the purchase of State Letters in the secondary market “continued” and that “we will already see what we decided” during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled last week to reach around 1.350 million euros.
Moreover, according to the indiscret market operators, he would have bought Iranian and Portuguese securities again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities for a sum of €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt the minimum that they will follow the purchases (see page 29).
The economists also do not predict any significant changes in the direction.
Although more than three-month loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations under beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
“I don’t think I’m going to change your program considerably.”
"If not, it would run the risk of provoking new short-term tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that a progressive output is announced during the first quarter of 2011,” said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
by Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions on the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations so that the market remains stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the issuance institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that prevents a marked rise in revenues paid by the most fragile states,” a major bond manager said.
Because, if interest rates go over the clouds, the states will have even more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government is over.
After Italy had started the week in an annoying way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the 10-year bond rates.
The recovery of precarious calm.
At the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "indescifrable" and that a "imprevisible" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basic points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had shot up to 263 points, causing a certain revolt in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was greater than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, manifested "deep concern" about "the turbulences in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels have supposed a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (from 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (not 2.7%).
Therefore, the rumor that new budget provisions can be applied after the holidays, for a amount of €7 billion.
“In case necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted,” said Olli Rehn, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The bases of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short nor long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested to Italy are smaller than those requested to other countries,” says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem is political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be opened unfavourable to decision-making in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflects on Strengthening Crisis Mechanisms
Christine Lagarde said: “I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and day that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the bond rates of European states has driven the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a normalization principle.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent white in the current speculation.
“As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems,” the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
“The political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Conscious of this hatred and the dangers it hides, European countries intensify debates to strengthen the already existing outcome mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on a good way.
And this taking into account the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the column of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (FEEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it prepares the ground.
The first issuances of securities from the FEEF are expected to take place next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through an additional IMF direct commitment.
As for the countries in front line, Portugal and Spain, these are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are added to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both of them want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms they consider indispensable to sustainably increase confidence.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds propose the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the public bond markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get the portfolio back.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading actor in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around 100 billion euros would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, currently equipped with 60 billion euros.
A council that could undoubtedly examine the European capital in detail.
Especially if the market conditions are worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the strong snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although snow also slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers are expected between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Island of France and Lemosin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it is not conducted except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardía has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the traffic of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “insists all drivers to drive with the greatest prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the forecast snow.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: First Financial Wipes
Since the debate on the modernization of transportation on the island of France has reached its high point, billions of rains.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of €4 billion.
In theoretical terms, this amount will be the one that will later allow the SGP to obtain loans on the markets to fund a part of its double bucle.
Today we have the first accounts.
The 2010 rectificative financial law, examined at the National Assembly’s financial committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on the offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "in the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists “to modernize it, increase its product and destroy that increase to the Société du Grand Paris”.
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it is far from 4 billion.
“It is necessary that tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project advances,” we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this.
“After the moment in which income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain.”
"It will be registered in the budget and will be used according to the needs."
The SGP estimates that it will begin receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly burning parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avengers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that just looks like a scandal before the hypocrisy that governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes internationally and predicts a future dominated by the regression.
Let us go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service ( regardless of the country to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs just reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile takes a long time giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule according to which secret records should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templaries or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occultist texts don’t want to do unpublished research (or don’t know where to look for news about the inexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they’ve already learned.
This is Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informator is perish, just as it is perish (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same that the Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have these revelations caused such rebelliousness?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassy, at least since World War II and since the Chiefs of States can call themselves by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, have turned into spy centers.
Any spectator who sees research movies knows it perfectly, we just seem that we don’t know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the U.S. diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “verdugs”.
But we go into the true nature of what has happened.
Anciently, in the time of Orwell, he could conceive every power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has become reality since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken, the citizen became in this way a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypt of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the vendor of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power endure that can no longer keep his own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public scope; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means removing him all power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, the States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a full street poster.
But it also turns out that, with the current technologies, you cannot expect to keep confidential conversations by phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and has contacted one of the homologues.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the moment, my forecast is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelesca, but I imagine government agents that move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, hiding some data written in the stickers of their shoes.
That information was then stored, in a single copy, in closed boxes with key: at the end, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a cramp, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a cable telegraph.
The video (analogic) bands had allowed film researchers to study a step-by-step film, advancing and backward, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to advance or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the ships it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the normal that politics and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
A last comment.
Previously, the press sought to understand what was secretly transmitted in the embassy.
At present, it is the embassy that asks for confidential information to the press.
Climate: France's chapuses in its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (fast start or early) made by developed countries have been met.
The French cappuccino has been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union agreed to contribute €7.2 billion in three years and France €1.260 million (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to the fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation resulted appreciable and was appreciated for what really is worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right path towards the fulfilment of its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to the official development aid.
Unfortunately, there has not been an agreement on what it means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, each one chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international financing isined and 150 million in three years are added in the concept of fast-start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references as regards the year or the level of official development aid.
France, on the contrary, considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, it does not refer to the expenses of the previous years or the total level of the official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it claims that it respects its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another key element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain profitable investments (often projects related to emission reduction based on more efficient technologies), it is failed to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As much, it should only be calculated for your commitments the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e., the equivalent to a rate of interest).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros making a 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it by its own eyes.
It is the only country in the EU that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the shares in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million “new and additional”, as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has taken over the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue donating when they can simply borrow?) as well as in negotiations, since developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter of early financing is a thorough, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be a more sand grain in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We hope it is not so.
Whatever it is, it is indispensable to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the rest of the EU countries.
But, in particular, France could make the discussions on gambling bets in relation to long-term financing advance (an other essential chapter that is currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its attitude to become as progressive in this matter as it is with others.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new Environment Minister, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast starts and its vision of the “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance in negotiations.
Advertisements on pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child injects 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problematics treated,” acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that a 10-year-old child usually consumes in four meals and a tentempié a day.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the golosins, were examined in the laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancer agents and five are classified as safe cancer agents, as well as 37 are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
“While, in practically the whole of the cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially cancer-genic and/or PE contaminants is worrying,” the association says.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain by themselves more than a dozen possible cancer waste and three considered safe cancer agents, as well as about a dozen waste that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as tentempié for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green Jews in Kenya, including in food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian filet, lawn tuna and even the bread bar or chicle were adhered with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the grape, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chlorform.
At dinner, the salmon roll was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical waste detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these “contaminant cocktails” generate for the consumer “probably is underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its part, has proposed "from the severity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (AESA) indicated the presence of waste of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
