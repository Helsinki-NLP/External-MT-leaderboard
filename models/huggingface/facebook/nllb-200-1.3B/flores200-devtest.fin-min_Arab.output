This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also revealed things not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The researchers found that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed quarter called a feather, but they do have other feather features such as toughness and feathery rays, the researchers concluded that the feather is likely a later stage of evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for thermal adjustment or sound effects. Although the feathers were those of a young dinosaur, the researchers found that the sample came from the feather suit of an adult individual, not from the feathers of a young.
Although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers found that the specimen came from the feather suit of an adult, not from the fangs of a young.

below them are the medium-sized cats, who eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are much larger in number.
The secret to their success is what is called the ecological box, a concept that says that each cat has a special function that makes it uncompetitive.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.

Oselots prefer to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they catch them. Almost all the animals the oselot preys on are much smaller than it is.
Researchers believe that oselots track and find edible animals by sniffing the land they have been on.
Oselots are very good at seeing in the dark, thanks to their dim light, and they move very subtly, hunting by blending in with their surroundings and then rushing on to their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or across a river or to a new island, it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to its new environment, it gradually begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, each population will look so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
we call this process "species", which just means that we're creating a new species, and that's a necessary consequence of evolution, and a very important part of it.

Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100.

Then the name of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.


Self-employed farming is farming where enough food is produced to feed only the farmer and his family.
self-sustaining is a simple, often nature-based system whereby natural seeds are used in an eco-area in combination with co-farming or other relatively simple methods to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-employed farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel they are rejecting the norms of society and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may differ based on age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of members.


one of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use the example of the few unfortunate children who grew up without the socialization provided by adults either as a result of neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse.

others are said to be raised by animals, some said to live in their own nature.
If raised entirely by an animal other than man, the feral child behaves (within its physical limitations) almost exactly the same as its pet, for example, by showing a similar fear or indifference toward humans.

The ladder is not a learning method, but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of stick, but so is the little paper clip of Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, give suggestions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do without help.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do.
We're keeping the foster care system as a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a level playing field, and reliable health care.
The aim of placing children is to meet all the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
Internet is a combination of mass communication and human communication.
The specific features of the Internet mean additional dimensions in the case of the use-case theory.

Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new influencer perspectives when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recorders has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-images, or facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Especially has it been argued that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that certain animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, selection removes it from the store of variation that has occurred.
The divergence and recombination shift back and forth between these two stocks with each generation.
The human digestive system is similar to that of a primate, but it is difficult to obtain enough amino acids from plants available in the savannah.
And if we don't have them, we're going to have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources available would have been the proteins from leaves and peas, but for a handful of us, they are hard to digest without ripening.
The food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a rich supply of all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption means intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep a little later (after 1060 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively silent alarm clock, which restores consciousness but does not fully awaken.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, where you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which is when you have to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force is. It is possible for everyone to find complete peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. the only thing that's stopping us from achieving enlightenment is our own tension and negativity.

basically, tibetan buddhism is very simple. includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
undaliyogaundalienergy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, so the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war, clashes of systems, procedures and cultures led to the division of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war really took place, with proxy armies fighting on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Poland's defenses had already broken by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the ability of the enemy to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the United States tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.

Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat and wool.
The goats were usually reared as herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds, often children or juveniles, such as the more familiar shepherds. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they enabled the horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.

The practice became common, but the iron consumed more wooden wheels than the wagons.
Then wooden wheels were replaced with iron, and in 1767 the first full-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the evolution of Homo erectus.
Australopithecus, the species that preceded it, did not walk upright as consistently.
The specialization of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4.23.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is often the same as treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.

After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as Dunlap's Open Sheets.
John Nixon first read the document aloud in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
one of them was sent on july 6 to george washington who read it to his troops in new york city on july 9 and one copy arrived in london on august 10.
The 25 Dunlap Open Arches are the oldest known surviving copies of the document.

The internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent.
The best sign of internal poisoning is a visible, open medicine jar or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for the first aid instructions for the poison in question.
Entomologists use the term "lutes" for this particular group of insects.
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times, bedbugs were very common, and bedbugs are insects that are well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both beetles and slugs are nest-parrots, adapted to living in their host's nest or shell.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can, if they wish, make an adoption plan for their young child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, whereby the other couple can act as the child's parent.

Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As Greek language's knowledge of the West declined, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythm observed in many anatomical and behavioral processes is often very much dependent upon the existence of innate cycles and their being generated by biological clocks.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely for a certain period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hersey and Chase's study was one of the most important clues to the fact that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments either by marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or by radioactive breaking the phage protein.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the gene part is, and whether they affect the germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to the offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours and exploring the ecosystem.


In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car transport system.
Science now indicates that the huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, seldom do we hear as many complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they cheat every day? Is it just the inefficiency of the traffic planners? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Thanks to the relatively uniform behaviour of the drivers, traffic flows are generally moderately consistent and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been created between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, only the sunbird and the sunbird are insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with over eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at 6 miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The actual Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Though the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest state in the world in terms of population.
The Vatican State uses the Italian language in its legislation and in its official communications.

Total population of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.

Aristóteles, filosofo, teorizó que todo consisti en combinao de uno o más elementos que eran la tierra, agua, aire, fuego.
in the same order solid, liquid, gas and plasma but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.Don't forget that in a periodic system there are many elements.
Aluminium and potassium are considered to be metals, although there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metallic alloys with small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.

The atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit in the trillions of the final point of this sentence.
So for many, the pencil was a good friend when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing styles, the value and purpose of the pencil have been left as a mystery.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen, and the sharpener never needs to be sharpened.
You can only guess what happens to the keyboard once something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus, which is made up of many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, but if you split the core again, you release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to break down under little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The moon's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the visible side of the Earth and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side of the moon.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker up in the air.
The darker areas of the ocean may be more visible on the visible side because the crust is thinner. The slab was easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with what is behind people's behaviour or what attracts them.
Theories of the future suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as adults.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.

such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, keeping discipline, evaluating performance, sharing responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the individual is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between managers and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to be of the same quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than the regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.

An invisible team is a management team to which all members report. An invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process required to set up a learning organisation? One of the objectives of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be created.
The resulting process, where the organisation works together to overcome a barrier, can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.

The proliferation of new technologies is making it possible to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI is thought to be closely related to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent action.
examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and hand gesture, voice and face recognition.
have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and defence, just as it is embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution, virtual classroom tours, where students can view museum objects, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art from their desks.
The virtual sharing of a class trip is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
Students at the Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, plan a website for their trip to the state capital each year, and the website is updated every year, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of dictionary.

Canada is a country of millions of people.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians in Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and by nature the largest of the continents.

The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it had a lot of influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
Europeans began to influence and colonize the world in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
All female travellers, regardless of actual civil status, are encouraged to state that they are married.

Casablanca, the modern city, was founded in the tenth century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.

Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried underground most of its streets, especially in the city center.

The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, where you will also find some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trackers.

When combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.

It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by sand in the desert.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and Crocodile Lake to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature areas, each of which supports a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily protection and entrance fee, as in all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives you access to either part of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the Hong Kong territory and is a major destination for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering column plan, best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
Hong Kong can be seen to its best by leaving the island and heading for the opposite Kowloon harbour area.

This is the exact spot where the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for clues to the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian side of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves, however, but include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife refuge, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 elk.




The Oyapock River Bridge is a vertical bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], it is 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 3.5 meter [3.5 m] plates.
The bridge has a sub-traffic height of 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, at which time the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important of the indigenous groups that inhabited the territory of what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-pastoral hunters, but also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.

Paraguay, once known as the "Giant State of the Indies", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples of the country.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted 300 years.
