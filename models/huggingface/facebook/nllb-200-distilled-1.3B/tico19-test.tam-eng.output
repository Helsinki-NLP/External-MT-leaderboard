From 1 January to 15 March 2020, the rapidly increasing successive cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The gradual phenomenon of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has a different sequence depending on the country, is progressing rapidly in all countries, with similar trends in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Based on the experience gained from Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs, healthcare, especially those requiring intensive care, should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 cases.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the agent causing it is currently a novel strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
According to the available evidence to date, approximately 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 have had a mild illness, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these have a cure.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes the most severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops into a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the post-COVID-19 trends in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with the period 31 January - 15 March 2020 in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Following China, COVID-19 has spread more geographically and the current COVID-19 pandemic situation in the rest of the world is lagging behind that in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported Europe's first confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were those who returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. Thus, between 31 December 2019 and the date of the report, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths have been reported in Italy alone.
Follow-up figures and events are being received on COVID-19 cases.
Only official data on reported COVID-19 case numbers from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO in each country globally is updated daily at 8am.
The data were used to estimate the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and compare them to the trend in Italy.
In response to the area of disease per COVID-19 case, we calculated the 14-day rapid overall incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
As on 15th March 2020 at 8 am, we have also provided a staggered number of cases per country for the period 31st January - 15th March 2020 as compared to Italy.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trend of 14 day rapid overall cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (China) follows the trend of Hubei Province (Figure 1).
The gradual increase in the spread of COVID-19 across the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom started on 21 February and then accelerated on 28 February 2020 (subject matter).
This was largely achieved through a rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increasing trends in subsequent cases of COVID-19 (substance).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases available for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020 when compared to Italy and the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom.
As of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported cases in Italy, only 3 weeks earlier or earlier, in comparison.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Looking at the overall trend of COVID-19 related events, it appears that the pandemic is progressing relatively rapidly in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages of the disease, national public health practices differ, different definitions of prevalence are used in different countries and different procedures are followed, including rapid screening, to select patients for testing for COVID-19 confirmation.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 infection required intensive care, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had reached peak capacity.
Data on COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level at 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic fashion to support the ongoing surveillance data which focuses on the number of recorded cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 found that Europe has a large disparity in the availability of ICU and ICU beds, with rates of 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and intermediate care beds per 100,000 in 2010-11).
In the context of the healthcare capacity concentration level samples, the ECDC Rapid Critical Assessment on COVID-19 has been updated for the sixth time for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, where the risk of an increase in the number of patients in the ICU beds is estimated to be more than 90% higher among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
The EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have so far been the focal points of the disease outbreak in specific regions, and since hospitals and ICU units are typically serving the regional population, information on the number of cases and ICU beds should be made available in the border division naming system 2 (Nuts-2).
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs must therefore prepare themselves for the persistent community spread environment of SARS-CoV-2 and the increased number of COVID-19 cases, and for the need for healthcare, especially intensive care, that has emerged in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, shifting from mitigation to containment requires a proactive and all-inclusive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and if not implemented early, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases will not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, adapt and respond to the situation.
Rapid risk assessment lists the impact of the pandemic and public health measures that are not limited.
There is a small window of opportunity, and there are possibilities for countries to use it to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce the crisis on the healthcare sector, and further increase containment efforts.
Failure to do so could mean that healthcare systems in the EU/EEA countries facing fatigue could face a huge increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has so far killed 3,000 people in China and other parts of the world, infected 80,000, and caused a disaster for humans.
Like SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be spread from bats and can produce similar symptoms in a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive coverage of the rapidly evolving field of study.
We will look at the basics of epidemiology, disease origin, pathogenology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this research will help us understand the threat of the disease and eliminate it.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday season and for several weeks afterwards due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The pathogen's characteristics are consistent with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases has reached 80,000, of which 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is ""public enemy number one"" and that it is more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on the pathogenic sequence of various patients was published on 7th January 2020, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 related pathobiology, epidemiology, disease origin, diagnosis and treatment.
The survey seeks to summarise the progress of research on the new and rapidly evolving subject.
Whenever possible, we try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus diseases, including the Middle East Syndrome (outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far on disease prevention and prediction of disease impact, and the remaining pressing questions.
Since approximately 15% of coronaviruses are primarily responsible for the common cold, coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal organisms in humans.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly pathogenic human CVDs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began in the early stages in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and spread to many more countries, causing devastating disease outbreaks and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus in recorded human history.
The National Health Commission of China was first informed on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan about the occurrence of pneumonia of unknown origin affecting groups of people, as shown in Figure 1.1.
Seven days later, the sequence of the covid-19 was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and other countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers received reports of infection, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was completely closed and all its public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical review of the disease reported that of the 41 infected patients, only 21 had time-contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site where the unconfirmed animal outbreak began.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and nearly 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
The extent and severity of the latest outbreak is yet to be determined as the environment is changing rapidly.
In a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases as on 11 February 2020, newly reported cases of the epidemic have been published as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but the main victims are people aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years of age, with a very small number under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected individuals were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be more prevalent in males (0.27/100,000) than females (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in large numbers mainly in Hubei and surrounding areas.
Since the onset of COVID-19, it has taken an average of 5 (2-9) days to diagnose the disease.
The mean duration of the period of onset of symptoms is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproductive number (R.0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the modified R.0, 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases spread rapidly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among the confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Gender (men), age (60 and above) and acute pneumonia are the three major risk factors for COVID-19.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and single-stranded, sensory RNA-RNA-containing, enzyme-linked pathogens.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta. Alpha- and beta-CoVs have been shown to be infectious to humans.
The membrane spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and typeptidyl peptidase 4 (TPB4), respectively, for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, followed by membrane binding.
In the pathogen, the RNA is released into the nucleus; after the pathogen is copied, the enzyme glycoprotein and the protein-linked superbiotic subunit of the RNA form a clot containing the mature pathogen, which then fuses with the membrane to express the pathogen.
The first genome sequence of SARS-KV-2 was registered on 10th January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% among 10 sequential samples collected at the Huan'an Seafood Market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the M-scale of human airway ultraviolet.
Human ACE2 has been found to be receptive to both SARS-KV-2 and SARS-KV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 in humans, but weaker than SARS-CoV. This coincidentally coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease among patients than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a modern small protein encoded by ORF3.B and a secretory protein encoded by ORF8.
ORF3.B of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogenic potential of the pathogen and inhibit the expression of IFNbeta; however, ORF8 has no known sequence or target.
On 18 February 2020, Jow et al. recorded the hypothermal electron microscope structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution, in combination with the amino acid nomenclature P0.AT1.
The opening and closing exoskeleton linkage was integrated into a biphasic compound, and the ACE-2-B0AT1 linkage will combine two S proteins that can identify and be the source of infection with the COVID-19.
B0AT1 may be a potential target for drug surveillance to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Start and intermediate bearing
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing the evolutionary genetic pathways of other SARS-CoVs with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originally lived in bats. Because of the 96% similarity in patterns with two SARS-like CoVs from new pathogens bats, SARS-CoV-CoVZX45 (bat-SL-CoVZX45) and SARS-CoVZ21 (bat-SL-CoVZX21), the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.
However, it is not yet known what caused the virus to spread across the species barrier to humans, nor is the mode of transmission clear.
Gie and others have proposed that the pathogen may be transmitted from bats to humans by snakes due to similar recombination of their S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that ants, a species of ant-eating mammal with a long skin mask commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, may have been the carriers of SARS-CoV-2 because the coronavirus found in ants and SARS-CoV-2 are 99% genetically similar.
However, the 1% difference in the total spread between the two genomes is still a large difference, and we are still waiting for reliable results from the hard evidence (Fig. 33).
Little is known about the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to be active in dry environments for up to 48 hours and up to 5 days in an environment with a temperature of 20 °C and humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be susceptible to ultraviolet radiation and exposure to temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide, chloroform and other fatty solvents will actively deactivate the pathogen, but chlorhexidine does not.
The entire human population is immune to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore vulnerable to novel pathogens.
Currently, there are no reports of any extensive studies on the preventive effects of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only validate previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4) 4).
Generally, when a pathogen infects an infected person, it is first identified by the infected person's immune system by apparent recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, DAL-like receptors (DLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-like receptors (RLRs).
The pathogen induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of the lymphocytes, synthetic production of type 1 immunity proteins (IFNs) in various ways, which limits the spread of the pathogen and increases the way the pathogen is absorbed and destroyed by the blood cells of the pathogen's antibodies.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the pathogen escape immune responses.
Soon, the mutant immune response joins the fight against the pathogen.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play a key role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells excite B-molecules to produce other antibodies against the specific pathogen, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
To help the immune cells, T helper cells produce cytokines that are beneficial to inflammation.
However, the coronavirus may induce the spontaneous death of lymphocytes, inhibiting their function.
The immune system and other antibodies, including the byproducts C3.A and C5.A, are necessary to fight the pathogenic infection.
For example, other antibodies obtained from recovered patients disabled MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system will release a large number of endogenous molecules in the area due to overactivity, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, various organ dysfunction and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its group initiation elements, is more likely to affect older people with both diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to large numbers of pathogens or whose immune systems are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
For SARS-CoV-2, the time interval for onset of symptoms, with a minimum duration of 1-14 days and a maximum of 3-7 days, was estimated based on a study of 425 infected people in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients reported that the average time to onset of symptoms was 3 days and could range from 0 to 24 days.
In a more recent study, the time interval for onset of symptoms was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a population of 8,866 cases as described above.
The most important task for health authorities is to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the interval of onset of symptoms, so that people who are infected but asymptomatic can avoid spreading the pathogen to others.
As a general practice, individuals who are exposed to the pathogen or have been infected usually need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The major and early stage symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be asymptomatic or asymptomatic, or accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, body pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of infection, some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypokaliasis.
In severe cases, patients developed severe appetite disorder syndrome, toxic shock, metabolic acidosis and blood clot mutation.
Patients with flu and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if they do not have lung disorders, should be screened during early diagnosis.
A population survey conducted in late December 2019 showed that 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, 3% diarrhoea etc. were the percentages of symptoms; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Two recent studies have reported similar findings in a family group and a group that had transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a population study in 2012 found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, as MERS is more lethal than COVID-19, 80% of them require oxygen support, in addition to COVID-19 patients.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found among MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), indigestion (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms.
As of 14 February, the global number of confirmed cases was 66,576, while the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS was 10% of 8,096 cases in November 2002.
In Mersin, the death rate is 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a population survey conducted in June 2012.
Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2's R.0, was in the range of 2 to 4 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 and a higher R.0, of 6.47.
Comparisons of symptoms, mortality and R0 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the latter is less lethal than the other two.
Thus, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The incidence of gradual outbreaks occurs from time to time in the same household or in the same gathering or in vehicles such as luxury cruise ships.
Patients often have medical records such as having visited or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas, or having had contact with infected individuals or patients within two weeks of the outbreak.
However, there have been reports that people can carry the pathogen without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may be re-carriers of the pathogen, which sends a warning signal for extended quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially, lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymph nodes with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L, including a serum serum cell count of less than 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate amino transducer and superbugs were found.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and platelets in the blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive platelets and platelets in the blood.
In the critically ill patients, the blood had higher levels of the blood clotting agent T-ACE and a very low urine cell count.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormalities have been detected on chest radiography and there has been a translucent condition such as bilateral patches or rubbery in the lungs.
Patients have periodically developed abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
The activation of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the level of diffuse oxygen and increases the peripheral pressure, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, poor breast radiograph findings occasionally show the most severe nature of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 reported the proliferation of pneumocytes, epithelial formation and tissue interstitial infiltration. Furthermore, multiple sperm cells with multiple locations in the lungs of the deceased patient, as in SARS and MERS patients, reported a pathogenic infection and pathogenicity of ARDS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as an important command-line tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the false-negative rate, which can increase the infectious disease, hospital exposures in China on 13 February 2020 used diagnostic methods (not relying on RT-PCR alone).
A similar scenario was seen in the diagnosis of SARS.
However, information on pre-existing diseases, tissue exposures, laboratory tests and radiological findings are essential and mandatory for proper diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Shang team described a SARS-CoV-2 detection procedure using CRISPR-based technology, in which synthetic SARS-KV-2 RNA particles were collected from 20 × 10-18 microliters/litre to 200 × 10-18 microliters/litre (10-100 copies per microlitre per input) at depths of one hour, without the need for extensive instrumentation.
It is believed that if validated in clinical trials, the new technology could dramatically improve sensory performance and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoV, physicians are mainly providing supportive care to COVID-19 patients while seeking different types of treatments that have been previously used or proposed as treatment for other coronaviruses and other pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table (Table 2) 2).
Antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicines and psychological support are the current and effective treatments.
Plasma from recovered patients was proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly competing to develop other antimicrobials and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs primarily and may also affect other organs such as the pancreas and kidneys to a lesser extent, which release ACE2.
However, respiratory failure or shortness of breath is a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which will include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, permeable ventilation and permeable mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe ADD should be supported by ECMO, a modified cardiovascular reverse pathway technology used to treat life-threatening heart attacks or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintaining the balance of electromolecular activity, preventing and treating secondary infection and toxic shock, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine loop is a result of the overactive immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of block inflammatory booster that will release a sequence of cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFF-alpha, IFF-beta, IFF-gamma and MCB-1.
These activators stimulate the immune system to release more endogenous molecules, which are important for ARTS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential to treat cytokine strains, especially in the treatment of acutely ill patients.
Dacilzumab, a cell disease antigen that is anti-protein and IL-6, is used to treat cytokine storm.
Other therapies for immunosuppression include modification of the T-cell-mediated immune response; inhibition of IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF-α; JAK suppression, Blinodemop; inhibition of cytokine signaling 4; and inhibition of HTAC.
Steroids have been widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective due to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In response, they can cause serious side effects, especially bone tissue damage without blood flow, which can have a significant impact on prognosis.
However, it is recommended that the prophylactic dose be administered in a short-term, at least moderate dose, to life-threatening COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antimicrobial therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a citric acid-based sequence, has been found to have the desired effect in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new class of pathogen-destroying drug initially developed by Glyde to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, even remdesivir showed the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNAs (RNAs) in the uterus, including MERS and SARS pathogens.
Based on these, GILED has provided China with a composite to test on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parazidinib, interveron-alpha, lopinavir/retonavir and ribavirin are recommended as standard of care for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other undesirable effects may occur.
The interval between these treatments and other medicines given to patients should also be carefully monitored.
Plasma and other antibodies from cured patients.
The practice of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease and treating other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In other words, recovered patients have higher levels of antibodies in their blood compared to the pathogens.
Antibodies are the immune proteins (IGs) produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign organisms, which identify and directly deactivate unique molecules in the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma of blood collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 was injected into 10 patients who were in a very critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and there was a reduction in inflammation and pathogenic load, and an improvement in blood oxygen levels.
However, as specific treatments have not yet been developed, confirmation and clarification are needed before proposing this on a large scale.
In addition, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma should be carefully considered, even if there are therapeutic effects.
For example, other antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause a syndrome that releases cytokines, which can become life-threatening toxins.
The blood is usually low in antibodies and has a high plasma requirement for the treatment of life-threatening patients.
It is difficult to develop and manufacture specific antibodies that are specific enough to fight a global pandemic quickly.
Thus, extracting B-cells from recovered patients, detecting the genetic codes of beneficial antibodies or detecting beneficial antibodies against essential proteins of the pathogen becomes more necessary and practical.
In this way, we can increase the production of other products instantly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, the effects of a formula will depend on the combination of different components and will vary depending on the diagnosis based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the components that can be useful are unknown or unclear because it is difficult to isolate and confirm such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, as there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is the main alternative therapy for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe cases.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Shing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In China, several provinces have reported high recovery rates, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hanan (50%), where TCM was used on 87% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a very rough comparison as many more influencing factors such as number of cases and severity need to be exhausted in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Pseudo Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (WM) alone and the combination treatment of TCM with WM.
They found that the time required for thermoregulation, symptom resolution and hospitalization was less for the group given traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine than the group taking Western medicine alone.
Most strikingly, the rate of symptom worsening (aggravation from mild to severe) is significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%). Furthermore, the mortality rate is lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCMM will have to wait for larger studies in well controlled environments and more centers.
Describe the mechanistic properties of the processes and explain the beneficial components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combinations.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 often experience a greater fear of infectious or even fatal illnesses, and isolated people experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Additional anxiety and depression can be caused by the development of infection-related symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, cough and by adverse effects such as insomnia caused by cardinoids taken during treatment.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there were reports of widespread mental health impairments, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic episodes, symptoms of psychosis, delusions, and suicidal ideation.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, which is part of the public health measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may further cause people to feel anxious and guilty about the effects of the pandemic, isolation and the threat to their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having the disease and those in close contact with them, and the general public in need.
Mental health teams, which cover different fields, should have clear exchanges and treatment plans with continuous and accurate updates on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and psychological support should include the use of professional electronic tools and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to disrupt the chain of transmission of animal stability and infection from infected humans to others, and should be accompanied by antimicrobial therapy to control infectious disease caused by emerging pathogens.
Efforts are underway to develop S-protein-based vaccines that produce long-lasting and inactivating antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
A direct dose vaccine for SARS has been evaluated in animal models.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines on elderly and dying specimens and their protection against animal-derived pathogenic infections have yet to be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago, and since then there have been no new outbreaks.
In contrast, MERS continues to occur in the Middle East in groups and populations, and spreads to other areas due to the presence of animals in the affected areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated pathogens, DNA plasmids, microorganisms, nanoparticles, pathogen-like particles and hybrid protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and important task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, due to the long time needed to inject the vaccine (average of 18 months) and the systemic variants of the coronaviruses, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty.
As a brand new disease, COVID-19 has just started its entire medical journey with thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may recover gradually without the after effects of the infection.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is likely to cause higher morbidity and mortality rates in critically ill patients.
Therefore, developing a predictive model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the clinical studies documented to date, the following factors may influence or be relevant to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is a crucial factor in predicting SARS recovery, and the same is true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 people with the disease, COVID-19 was primarily observed in 47.7% of those aged 30-65 years and in the population aged 50 years and above.
Patients requiring intensive care already had both diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those not requiring such treatment (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a factor in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000) than females.
Two diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care may suffer from severe heart failure and anemia.
Heart attacks have been the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and can cause liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that there is a strong link between age and chronic diseases and that they can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The severity of tissue injury or tissue genome is reflected in the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood, and disease, response to treatment and ultimately recovery are proposed as predictive factors for disease progression.
A link between CRP level and COVID-19 severity and prognosis of recovery is proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHT), aspartate amino substitute (ASD), alanine amino substitute (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver disorders.
Major clinical signs: Temporary improvement of breast radiography and clinical signs, effects of COVID-19 and complications should be considered along with other issues of prognosis.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are anti-inflammatory agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of damage caused by inflammation during infectious diseases.
Since high doses of proton therapy have been widely used on severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from life-long disability and poor quality of life with hemolytic osteoporosis.
Thus, if necessary, short-term, low-dose steroids should be used for COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 outbreak experience unusual stress due to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessing the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential that these patients recover from mental freeze and return to normal life with psychological counselling and long-term support.
Population studies to date have shown that COVID-19 has different pathways of disease than SARS.
In addition to multiplying in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also multiplies efficiently in the respiratory tract and, like other coronaviruses that cause colds in the early stages of infection, it multiplies in the body with little or no symptoms.
Thus, infected patients may produce higher levels of pathogen during the early stages or the period of onset of symptoms, during daily activities, which can make it more difficult to control the spread of the infectious disease.
However, while most outbreaks do not occur in the early stages, the spread of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were in a state of severe decline.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is becoming more and more intense and is harder to contain than SARS.
In the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, special efforts have been made, including a lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantine of virtually the entire population.
While these activities have caused severe damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is contained.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the period of decline will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which is more transmissible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and others established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that two-thirds of the world's population would be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
A Canadian team has reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the spleen and throat of patients who recovered from the hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered pathogen may be circulating in a manner similar to that of the common cold.
However, there are promising signs in China based on the declining number of new infections, indicating that current strategies are working.
Initially, it was estimated that Ebola would infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to become less virulent and gradually disappear, or to become a low pathogenic pathogen that can be present in humans.
The comparison of SARS and MERS to COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted through cough and sneeze, and there is also the potential for transmission through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The pathogen has also been detected in feces, raising new possibilities of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 infected people found that 41% of the patients, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers, may have been infected by hospital disinfection.
Thus, special arrangements must be made to protect the people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients and even those who stand by the side of infected people.
Wearing face masks as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection, surgical masks and N.95 respirators (series # 1860S) can also help control the spread of the pathogen.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from passing from an infected person to others in an environment where airborne or surface pathogens can be transmitted.
However, only N.95 (series #1860S) masks provide protection from inhalation of small adult pathogens of 10 to 80 mm, of which only 5% of adult pathogens can fully penetrate; the level is similar to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), both at approximately 85 nm.
Since five surgical masks stacked together can be punctured and particles can pass through, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N-95 (Series # 1860S) masks instead of surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the pathogen.
Pathogens can also be transmitted through the eyes of individuals.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor, despite wearing an N.95 mask, became infected with SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear translucent masks or goggles when working with patients.
It is strongly recommended that all members of the general population in affected or potentially affected areas wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to self-isolate and stay indoors, and minimize contact with individuals who may have been exposed.
The distance of three feet is considered to be the proper distance to keep people safe from the patient.
These activities are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection while preventing the spread of pathogens.
Despite SARS-CoV-2's arrival in the human world as a new pathogen, its extreme structural similarity to SARS-CoV should have created a high level of concern in China, based on a deep recall of the 2003 SARS outbreak, according to data from 7 January 2020.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control had been reassuring citizens that the new pathogen was less contagious and spread more easily from person to person, and that prevention and control of the disease was not a problem.
The news eased public awareness, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, a crucial moment in which the disease was to be kept at a minimum in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China can take these hard lessons and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when issuing public announcements, as every word can be taken into account by citizens and change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and proactive to unusual information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) try to contain the epidemic at an early stage with more control rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) provide specific and rewarding training periodically to help increase public awareness of the epidemic and improve the testing of the community's pulmonary system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
The pathogen is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, which has created a sense of COVID-19 outbreak as a recurrence of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to control the spread of the infectious disease and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger individuals, men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older people than younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the pathogen even though they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients only transmit the pathogen if they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more rapidly and extensively than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, routine RNA tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 have shown negative results.
On the other hand, the test of recovered patients may again show pathogenic infection.
These findings could dramatically increase the risk of pathogen transmission.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several key issues remain unresolved.
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic consensus has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses, we still cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What intermediate animal species caused the pathogen to spread from the primitive bats to humans?
Without the answers to #1 and #2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the spread could start again at any time.
Molecular models and biochemical assessments have reported that ACE-2 binds to SARS-CoV-2. But how does the pathogen enter airway cells and cause the subsequent pathogenic mutations?
Does the pathogen bind to cells that release ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long can plague last?
How does a pathogen genetically mutate when it is transmitted from person to person?
Will it be a global epidemic, disappear like SARS, or appear periodically like the common cold?
This is necessary, but it takes a little longer to answer the above and many more questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the spread of this pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives, no matter the cost.
Animal transmission of the human coronaviruses (HCoV)
For thousands of years, co-evolution, genetic mutation and adaptation of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their derivatives, including humans, have been driven.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause moderate disease, such as the common cold.
The severe and sudden outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have revealed how devastating and life threatening the human coronavirus is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought renewed attention to coronaviruses and its high transmissibility but at the same time surprisingly low morbidity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The human coronaviruses are of animal origin and it is useful for us to understand the animal origin of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
Most human coronaviruses originated from bats, and in these, they do not cause disease.
Intermediate stable variants of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Studying the interactions between coronaviruses and organisms in animals may provide important insights into the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), focusing on their history of discovery and their animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in terms of pathogen evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this thread.
In addition, the requirements for successful organismal mutations and the effects of pathogenic evolution on disease severity are pointed out.
Coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family, which includes a group of freeze-dried, positively active, single-stranded RNA-like pathogens.
The pathogens, which have the largest genome of erythrocytic RNA (RNA) pathogens, with 26 to 32 kilobases, were called coronaviruses because of the crown-like shape visible under the electron microscope.
Structurally, coronaviruses have undivided lineages that share a similar structure.
In the genome, about two-thirds of the genes contain two large, overlapping bioframes (overlapping open reading frames (ORF1A, and ORF1B)), which are translated into 'replicase' polymorphisms, BPA1A and BPA1A.
These variants are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp 1-16 and nsp 16 is a non-structural protein.
The remainder of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins including spine (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The unique sub-proteins of each gene are encoded by different genetically-derived coronaviruses.
Based on protein sequence differences, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), which include most human coronaviruses in the beta-coronavirus strains, and are further divided into four inheritance pathways (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and bats serve as the genetic source of most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the main source of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continuously overcome genetic barriers, and some of them have evolved into important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus strains have been identified.
Among them, human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus NL63 are alpha-coronavirus.
The other five beta-coronavirus include human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) usually cause mild symptoms such as a cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection, which is more common in patients with relatively high severity respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and patients with non-pulmonary symptoms.
The first human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of people with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected on human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), both of which cause self-contained symptoms, through extensive studies.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infections caused by human coronaviruses were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS epidemic was one of the most devastating in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people and claiming the lives of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a series of outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread widely to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world must prepare for the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Seven types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are animal-derived due to their origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports that all human coronaviruses (HCoVs) evolved from bats, with pathogens that are well adapted and pathogenic but show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Detecting the animal origin of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) provides a framework for understanding natural history, motivation, and factors that control interspecies transmission.
This could guide or facilitate the search for stable, intermediate and multiplying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the general theme that the parent pathogens of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are generally pathogenic in their natural stagnant host but become pathogenic in new host after interspecies transmission.
We also review the evolutionary trajectory of the human coronavirus (HCoV), which shows that increased transmission leads to decreased morbidity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is being discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have only been known to exist since the late 1930s.
Before isolating the strain B814 of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) from the nasal mucus of patients infected with the common cold, different coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
A summary of the history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order (Table 1) is illustrative and informative.
The first human coronavirus strain - HCoV-229E - was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WUI-38 lung cell lines.
Typical cough symptoms of patients infected with the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) are headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough being observed in 10 ~ 20% of infections.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus pathogen-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was isolated from organ culture and pathways in the brains of mice.
The epidemiological features of human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are similar to those caused by human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), which are not distinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A and rhinopharyngitis in terms of symptoms.
Both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are globally prevalent and are transmitted in temperate climates during the winter season.
Generally, for these two pathogens, the time interval between onset of symptoms is less than a week, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) developed moderate levels of normal saliva.
Only a few immunocompromised patients were found to have severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "abnormal pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-infectious disease and SARS-CoV pathogen in human history, and the third HCoV detection.
The first SARS case was detected in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic has reported 8,096 infections with 774 deaths, and has spread to many countries and continents.
Except for super-spreads, each infection is estimated to result in approximately two secondary infections, with a symptomatic period of 4 to 7 days and a viral peak on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have muscle aches, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by respiratory distress, cough and respiratory distress as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests, and high levels of creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In SARS patients, extensive respiratory chamber damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increase in macrophages are seen.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be affected in these severe infections, usually accompanied by cytokine circulation, which can be especially dangerous for patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient at the Index Hospital who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, the greatest efforts have been devoted to human corona pathogen research.
The human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by the human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) include cholera, meningitis, fever and bronchitis.
Another independent study described the same pathogen being isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread globally.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses are caused by the human coronavirus pathogen-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and its peak incidence occurs in summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is associated with obstructive vocal folds inflammation, also known as spinal stenosis.
In the same year, the human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, the human coronavirus pathogen -HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is thought to be associated with an increased incidence of severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected globally, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are also well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to cause potentially infectious diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons, as is the rare occurrence of a highly aggressive subtype of the human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63), which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory infection in China.
Generally, when these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) acquire the ability to spread effectively and persist in humans, they become less severe or pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed infections originated from the Middle East, infections with secondary transmission that may occasionally be caused by close contact from outside have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
South Korea had another secondary outbreak in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients infected with MERS also developed severe renal failure, a condition so far unique to MERS alone among human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed infections have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive pathogens known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency of concern and has designated the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed globally, with acute infection mortality at 3.4%.
Notably, Hubei, China has 4.2% of the deaths, while outside it there are only 1.2% of the deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, including fever, cough and shortness of breath, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Some patients have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms, and it can quickly progress to severe respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower morbidity but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reports of patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2 without showing symptoms, which is likely to contribute to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals similarities and differences between them.
First, the time interval between onset of symptoms and the duration of the human coronavirus disease are both similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general course of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics commonly seen during community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoV) infections, including absence of significant, moderate or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of those severely affected by COVID-19 also have a similar outcome to SARS-CoV infection, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics of both the community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoV) and the SARS-CoV, which are interesting variants.
On the one hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is necessary to check whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans is gradually decreasing, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will clarify whether, at least in some circumstances, fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as it does with SARS-CoV.
It is very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will manifest itself in the same way as the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that have spread in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained transmission after entering humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
In another perspective, it may also be true that humans have lived well with these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of an ancient human coronavirus pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and in humans who have developed severe HCoV infections have been eliminated.
To do this, the human coronavirus (HCoV) must be replicated in humans in sufficient quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive gene mutations that resist organism control factors.
In this way, SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to become fully compatible with humans as it persists for a longer period of time and affects a larger population.
If it changes itself according to circumstances, it is difficult to prevent transmission to humans by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread in the human population, causing common cold in people with weakened immune systems.
These pathogens do not require animal hosts.
In contrast, the more virulent pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and therefore cannot extend their transmission within humans.
They must survive and reproduce in their animal habitats and have the opportunity to move to vulnerable human targets, perhaps via one or more intermediate and proliferating hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the community.
At least in the current scenario, it's as transmissible as the social-binding HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and become stable or spread to humans without intermediate animal organisms.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, nature, intermediate and multiplication of hosts of human coronaviruses.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that shares high similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence, an animal acts as an evolutionary host for an HCoV.
This ancestor virus usually mutates itself to fit this host and is not pathogenic to the host.
Similarly, the stagnant organisms (hosts) persist with the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the parasites are naturally infected and are natural parasites of the human coronavirus or its parent pathogen.
In contrast, if HCoV is introduced to humans before or around the time of introduction to a new intermediate host, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disease.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and can replicate the host by allowing the virus to replicate continuously, then transmit it to humans to multiply the human infection.
If an HCoV virus is unable to sustain its spread to an intermediate host, it will expose itself to end-stage infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can mutate with an intermediate host and cause long-term disease transmission.
In this, the intermediate organism becomes a natural static organism.
Epidemiological data backtested and revealed that the first known infection of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
During subsequent immunological studies, animal traders were shown to have higher SARS-CoV immunity protein than the general population.
The masked palm fern cats (Phagoma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first known to carry pathogens such as SARS-CoV, which is similar to SARS-CoV.
The fact that no further SARS infections were reported after killing all the fungi in the markets is an implicit.
However, masked palm cats from forests or farms with no direct contact to animal markets have been reported to be mostly negative for SARS-CoV. These masked palm cats may only act as intermediate multiplier hosts, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS.
In particular, since various animals in markets in Guangzhou have 80% antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be denied that many species of small mammals may have also acted as intermediate multiplier hosts of SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be end-stage hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal organism of SARS coronavirus revealed a closely related SARS-related rhinoceros warbler coronavirus known as HKU3 (Sars RRH-Wow coronavirus HKU3) in Chinese equine bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other cowpox coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity.
These studies have laid a foundation for a new idea that bats are the hosts of the emerging human pathogens.
Several coronaviruses (SL-CoV) such as SARS have also been identified from bats, but nothing other than a unique WIV1 can be isolated as a live pathogen.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a bat stool sample, was shown to be able to use the receptor for cell entry by the bat, the civet (cat cell) and human ACE2.
Interestingly, the lymph of terminally ill SARS patients is able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% saturated acid sequence similarity.
Despite the high similarity between the two pathogens, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental pathogen of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not immediate stable hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups suggest that MERS-CoV is similar to the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Both the HCoV-4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for pathogen entry.
The beta-coronaviruses in the cowbell identified from Europe and Africa are genetically closely related to the RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the cowpox coronavirus-HKU25, share only 87% saturated acid sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be immediate stagnant hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that camels of isolated origin are photosynthetically positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, similar to the pathogen found in humans, has been isolated from the nostrils of camels in isolation, suggesting that camels act as true hosts of MERS-CoV.
Experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV were found to have generally mild symptoms but high levels of pathogenic exposure.
Infected camels spread the pathogen not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is the main route of pathogen exchange in bats.
However, since many confirmed disease outbreaks of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, transmission from humans to humans or unidentified animal species that carry MERS-CoV are said to be unknown transmission routes.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% citric acid similarity with the rat coronaviruses RATG13 isolated from rhinolopus afinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is so great that it causes a parental relationship.
That is, until nearly identical bats coronaviruses are found in the future, bats cannot be immediate stable hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Indirectly, wildlife species sold and killed in Huang's seafood wholesale market must have had intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with which many early cases of COVID-19 are associated, an animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on alternative genomic sequencing have suggested that a group of dangerous small mammals known as ants (Manis javannica) may also carry SARS-CoV-2-related ancestor beta-coronaviruses.
The novel ant coronaviruses share 85-92% of the nucleic acid sequence alignment with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 with a mark of about 90% in the saturated acid sequence.
They belong to two sub-genotypes of SARS-CoV-2-like pathogens in the genome tree, one of which shares a highly similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are very different, albeit on a genome-wide scale with high levels of sequence similarity.
A previous study of infected ants reported detection of pathogenic contusions from lung samples, which are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different recruitment methods and genome sequencing to create a partial genome sequence comprising approximately 86.3% of the full-length pathogenic genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal organisms of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct ant-pathogenic origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and ant-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and ant-related beta-coronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, ants and other mammals is to be established.
The highest sequence similarity has been found in RPDs between SARS-CoV-2 and ant, while SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest sequence similarity at the genome level.
A stronger hypothesis is that the high degree of similarity between ant worm SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is driven by selective mediated convergent evolution.
A third ant species in the wild has a counter-scheme for recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination between beta-coronavirus pathogens is widespread.
The mediator has not yet been included in the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly virulent human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) has been studied.
Genetic evidence suggested that both human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) may have originated from the vulture coronaviruses, while the parent pathogens of human coronavirus OC43 and human coronavirus HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A cow corona virus identified in the North American frontal buffalo, Appalachian Ridge Corona Virus 2, has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is genetically related to another bats coronavirus known as Hipposideros/Canaquam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current data on animal origin of known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses throughout history.
A pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded in 1890 when the human coronavirus strain HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from domestic cattle to humans.
The history of interspecies transmission of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is unclear.
The alpha-coronavirus of the cow has been identified as closely related to the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E).
Among them is the tiny alpha-coronavirus.
Several sources show that the pathogen is transmitted directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not apes, are the only ones who can interact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with the dwarves.
Second, the human coronavirus alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) was found to be different and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-coronavirus caused respiratory illness in the infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-corona pathogen was not found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility of the infection of the human HCoV-229E-related alpha-coronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendrix.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs act as gene banks for HCoV-229E, while alpacas and dromedary camels may act as intermediate hosts for transmitting viruses to humans, similar to MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to monotremes and from monotremes to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since it was first identified, and has been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats act as a convenient storage bank for viral species for genetic isolation and animal transmission.
Longevity, dense groups, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are the favourable conditions for bats to be an effective 'pathogen transmitter'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to single-celled camels for decades.
The virus has adapted well in camels, transforming camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural stagnant host.
MERS-CoV causes very moderate disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its spread to humans is an accident, and humans are the ultimate hosts of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its spread.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, if ants have any role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it would be different.
In particular, ant beta-corona viruses are highly pathogenic in ants.
Fungi can be end-stage hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronavirus, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans (SARS-CoV-2) must be demonstrated or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats may be a stable carrier of SARS-CoV-2 related pathogens, which are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitats with bats through butchers or coal mines.
Second, ants may be one of the newly introduced intermediate multipliers (hosts) of the SARS-CoV-2 related pathogen.
Humans acquire the virus by eating meat from butchers and game animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Other antibodies require analysis on domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the re-fusion and adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in a third species, which came into contact with bats and ants.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal organisms (hosts), three major factors on the pathogen side help coronaviruses to overcome the breeding barriers.
First, they have relatively high rates of gene mutation in their RNA replication.
Compared to other single-isolated RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high", with the average mutation rate being approximately 4 in 10 mutations per year per site, which may vary for novel hosts depending on the stage of the CoV.
Coronaviruses have bug-positive exoribonuclease alpha-alises, and removing them results in a high degree of genetic mutation and degeneration or inactivity.
Interestingly, the citric acid analogue remdesivir is known to suppress the coronaviruses' pathogenicity by blocking this exoributal and RNA-dependent ribosomal polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the genetic mutation rates of coronaviruses are a million times higher than their parasites.
In addition, the rate of genetic mutation is often high when the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are not well matched with the omnivorous organism.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower mutation rate, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation to humans.
Indirectly, it has already been replaced with another host that is close to humans.
In addition, this is not only true for SARS-CoV-2, but also for MERS-CoV, which has adapted to camels in isolation.
In theory, the gene against SARS-CoV-2 would render vaccines and antibiotics ineffective.
Second, the large RNA in CoVs induces additional plasticity in the gene mutation for genetic mutations and rearrangement, thereby increasing the probability of coevolution of the gaps, which is favorable for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the gene.
Third, coronaviruses alter their preforms at random and frequently during RNA replication through a unique copy-selection technique.
In the host that acts as a mixer, strand switching often occurs during COVID RNA transcription.
Highly synchronous full-length and subcellular ribosomal RNAs (RNAs) may recombine to form novel coronaviruses.
Genetic evidence of natural rearrangement is found in both human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), as well as animal coronaviruses such as bats SARS-like coronavirus and bats HKU9.
Pathogen-organism interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the above three pathogenic factors, the pathogenic interaction with the organism receptor is another important factor influencing the interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a notable example, which reveals evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of human and feline SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with a receptor made by the organism and is actively selected by the host organism's immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RPD is present in the S1 segment at amino acids 318 to 510 and binds to human ACE2 and its central receptors for pathogen entry.
The RPD of SARS-CoV is capable of sensing ACE2 receptors in various animals including vultures, bats, mice and raccoons, thus making inter-species transmission of the pathogen possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are found to be distinct from human and civet pathogenic extracts in RPD, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding attribute for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Cvet SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the association of the spike protein's interactions with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both of these amino acid variants are likely to be important for the pathogen to adapt to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same RNA receptor with SARS-CoV by the same organisms.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the S1 unit of the S protein may have altered the binding affinity of its S protein to human ACE2 (ACE2).
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests a 10 to 20 times higher affinity in this binding than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptors are required for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Ironically, the human coronavirus NL63 binds to ACE2 but with a variant of S.
There are several human coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43).
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after animal transmission of their animal hosts.
The effect of cell-receptor migration, human coronavirus (HCoV) transmission, and other organism-dependent and control factors are also regulated.
The difference in these biomolecular proteins between humans and the natural hosts of the human coronavirus (HCoVs) - beetles, monotremes and rodents - may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) must capture probiotic factors and reduce probiotic control factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this critical area of pathogen-biotic interactions will be identified and classified.
The use of state-of-the-art CRISPR technology will result in an unbiased genome-wide test on the bioavailability and control factors for SARS-CoV-2.
Exposure to novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs): to reboot
The diversity of the novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) offers numerous opportunities for the development of novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
In this case, the bats CoVs act as the gene bank of the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and gene re-fusion drive the evolution of the human coronavirus (HCoV), and this activity serves as two critical stages.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter pathogenic patterns.
Among SARS-CoV subproteins, it is thought that adaptation of ORF8 to humans is important because SARS-CoV-related cowpox pathogens encode different ORF8 proteins even when isolated.
The 29-nucleotide deletion trait of SARS-CoVs is a strain isolated early in the human pandemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive gene mutation that promotes mutation of the host.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of re-fusion with alpha and gamma coronaviruses, in which numerous small re-fusion sites were identified in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Reconstitution sites were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, an infection of MERS-CoV has been found to be susceptible to cross-breeding between different strains, occurring in uncontacted camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have reverse fusion events, in which the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) fuse with other animal coronaviruses (CoVs) with their non-structural genes.
Be aware that artificial selection may contribute to unexpected mutations in pathogenic genes, often by releasing pathogens from selection pressures such as the immune system of the host organism.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in human coronavirus 229E strains due to bi-acid deletion.
Since non-resistant ORF4 is found in human coronavirus 229E-associated buffalo and camel pathogens, the alpha-coronavirus shows single-nucleic acid insertion, resulting in a framing transition.
One last thing, the evolution of novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is driven by selection pressure in their static organisms (hosts).
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms were found when bats were infected with coronaviruses, indicating an inter-adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pro-inflammatory response by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by anti-reactivity of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and this is due to a low level of exposure to class I molecules with major tissue polymerization.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats suppress corona pathogen replication and affect exorbitant endothelial validation, thus providing the pressure for the generation of more pathogenic pathogen mutations when introduced into a new organism.
Rearrangement can lead to the development of highly pathogenic coronaviruses mutations, which lead to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for organism adaptation.
Thus, the emergence of three novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the last two decades is no accident.
Coronaviruses are pathogen-free or cause moderate symptoms in their host organisms, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without stimulating the strong host's immune response.
Here are the secrets to why asymptomatic infections are seen and what causes severe infections in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by stimulation of the immune response and cytokine loop, in which if the immune response is strong, the lung infection is more severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic patients, the immune response is removed from the coronavirus response.
The same tactic of suppressing the immune response may be beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The antibacterial response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the injection of type I interferon in humans during the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection is beneficial.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is deficient.
Through this reasoning, it was known that inhibition of NLRP3 inflessom with MCC950 is effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common theme from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although it has been found that the beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide parity with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus that shares 96% nucleotide parity with SARS-CoV-2.
Pug cats and other animals in markets have been found to carry pathogens similar to SARS-CoV, however no immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Ant beta-coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, suggesting that ant may act as one of the ant intermediate hosts or that ant beta-coronavirus may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Recently, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has brought the coronaviruses back into the limelight.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our view of animal origin in human transmission and the importance of animal stagnation of human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
If SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and fungi in the market, closing meat markets and killing fungi could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Considering the discovery of multiple strains of ant beta-coronavirus pathogens closely related to SARS-CoV-2, and for the same reason, ant must be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future investigations will clarify how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by ants and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been isolated from camels for decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation and an important source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done at wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent further spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new strains of genes can emerge that can cause serious disease.
A variety of animal-borne CoVs are in circulation.
In particular, the animal-borne bawl coronaviruses are highly variable.
There is a high potential for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, resulting in new coronaviruses that will be more transmissible and/or dangerous to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned.
Along with testing for SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a well-prepared response plan.
In fact, many pathogens have been on the planet for a very long time.
They will remain in their own natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that are favorable for transmitting pathogens, knowledge of this can reduce the risk of contact with bats and other wildlife species.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural organisms (hosts), which can be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future infection.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the transmission of the pathogen is for humans to stay away from the ecological habitats of natural animal pathogens.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the animal-borne origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain to be discovered.
First, it will be interesting to see in which context bats and ants share the same ecological importance if bats transmit the ancestral pathogen of SARS-CoV-2 to ants.
Second, if bats are more directly involved in human transmission, we need to figure out how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is to act as a true intermediate organism, it must be clear how it interacts with various organisms including humans, bats and ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing infections should be conducted.
If it is a bat, an ant or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent pathogens are expected to be identified in its natural host in the future.
A series of reviews in this area clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 suspected case and confirmed case.
On 6 February 2020, our team published Rapid Advisory Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and this guidance provided our experience and developed a better reference for fighting this pandemic globally.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing through ongoing research and clinical practice experiences, and therefore, strategies and treatments for detecting the infection are continuously being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment in our guidance and provide new diagnostic protocols issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, and is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus is also named Severe Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a pandemic.
In the fight against SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our team has developed a Rapid Instructional Guidance which has been published on the website of the Army Medical Review on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing through ongoing research and clinical experience, and therefore, strategies and treatments for detecting the infection are constantly being updated.
For example, the Code of Conduct for the Detection and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) contains seven versions, some of which have significantly changed contexts.
Now, we have received feedback from Xu and others on our guidance and they have introduced a simple assessment scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and is a great source of information about the pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and express our gratitude.
However, their work should be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (Flow 7th edition) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to determine whether an infection has occurred, the infectious agent must be linked to two items of clinical exposure for the purpose of conducting a total-dose analysis, or, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, it must satisfy three items of clinical exposure.
History of outbreak: (1) travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other community areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed in the citric acid test); (3) contact with a patient with fever and respiratory problems from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other community areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) (confirmed contact with a group of people with fever and/or respiratory disease for 2 weeks in small areas such as a classroom, office, school, and/or community) and 2 high-confirm contacts with symptoms.
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) have the characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or low total white blood cell count or decreased salivary cell count at the onset of transmission.
The detection of a confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full genome sequencing of the virus showing high affinity for known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for serum test specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody with a mutation from negative to positive or ≥4 times the recovery phase in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for citric acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; subsequent urological evidence was included in the seventh edition.
These changes, based on researchers' continued work to find the optimal nucleic acid detection tool for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, increased the availability of different samples, and supported bringing the specific antibody to positive endpoints at confirmed parameters.
In addition, we have more evidence to be cautious with patients with different symptoms and asymptomatic.
"Therefore, the profile of Sue and others who classify people without clinical symptoms as ""low risk"" needs to be updated".
Scoring system should be checked in clinical practice and studies.
Finally, we hope to publish more direct evidence and invite readers to comment.
We recommend that the new guidelines imposed in their respective countries for screening of "suspected persons" and "confirmed persons" be identified and followed.
Our team will update our guidelines for providing assistance from time to time.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day, the highest daily death toll.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the number of infections recorded by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh includes 114 infections and 33 recoveries.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online press conference, IETCR Director, Dr. Mirzadi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman died in the accident.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two persons were over 60 years of age, two persons were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He said two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saiboor Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitreya Hospital.
Speaking in a live video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Gwadar shared information that public transport will be suspended until next Saturday for a longer period than originally planned.
The public transport shutdown was initially scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential goods - medicine, fuel and food - is still allowed.
On 8 March, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them,
As of March 19, the three have already returned.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
The total number of coronavirus infections with SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths will be caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection, meaning its first coronavirus-related death in Zambia.
North Korea said it was one of the few countries that was free of coronavirus infections as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization recorded 1,051,635 confirmed infections, including 79,332 new cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. on 4 April.
The United States has reported more than 244,000 coronavirus infections, which have been linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that the coronavirus had caused more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced drastic measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that the city's lockdown had been extended until May 1.
Looking at the national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days, and the law was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended a day-long curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; previously, the curfew was only in place from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dwayne has announced that the stay-at-home order has been extended through May 1.
Stores in Australia are reducing the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles introduced purchase controls at two and one packs per transaction, respectively, at all of their stores nationwide.
The ALTI on Monday introduced a one-pack per person restriction.
The restrictions were posted as news on the outlets' websites and on the chains' Facebook pages.
It is known that consumers are buying up items due to fear of COVID-19 when people self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one package per delivery.
The changes follow the four-package rate control for an earlier transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"Galls said in a March 8 press release that, with four-package controls in place, ""many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", calling the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected"".
"A spokesman for Woolworths said sales had risen "" sharply "" last week. "
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowable amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles not only issued a recall for larger packages from suppliers but also increased delivery times. Woolworths recalled additional stocks, while ALDI prepared stocks for a planned Wednesday special sale.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that when retailers are trying to raise stocks, restrictions imposed by the local board on the delivery times of the goods are making it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise as suppliers struggle to meet demand, as critical raw materials are scarce.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores will not be able to operate the special Wednesday following the early release of stock.
Reporting on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said stores were filling up stocks every night.
He said that toilet paper is a bulky commodity which leads to low stocks and then the feeling of scarcity is further reinforced when you see that after all is sold, the wide shelves are all empty.
"The idea behind the Coles and Woolworths is that if you have a lot of items on your shelf, like toilet paper and detergent, in a [affordable] quantity, you can reduce the risk of unfounded fear", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said it was running out of stock last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of CleanX toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, the maker of Sorbent, say they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, News.com.au reports.
The first auction in Melbourne was held in May, with a small number of bids being held as buyers were resting during the long Labor Day weekend, according to domain.com, a website for buying and selling real estate.
The Thursday edition of ND News, a daily print in Darwin, included an eight-page clip that can be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a press release from ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a high demand for other items including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the UK supermarket Okado Andrus on Sunday evening limited its purchase of toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared COVID-19, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, a pandemic.
"While the term 'pandemic' refers to how widespread a disease is, not how dangerous the specific diseases are, the World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore highlighted the need for governments to take action:"
"All countries can change the course of the pandemic now".
"Countries must identify, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their populations", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO).
"The spread and severity of the outbreak is of grave concern and the failure to act on it is of grave concern".
"According to Dr. Tom Freedman, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented""".
"In a February CNN article, he said, 'No respiratory pathogens other than the common cold have been tracked from emergence to a sustained international outbreak.'"
"Cebraeus expressed a similar opinion, saying, ""We have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before"."
"He said, 'We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.'"
The pandemic was given new status in January following the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""It's going to get worse, basically"."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide was 126,000, with 4,600 deaths as a result.
201920 coronavirus infection is the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is currently in the onset.
The disease was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. It was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 infection cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 have recovered.
The overall mortality rate is 4% in China, while internationally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Fever, cough and shortness of breath are common symptoms
Complications may include pneumonia and severe respiratory obstruction.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can also be two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antimicrobial treatment.
Initial treatment is symptomatic and tolerant. Preventive measures recommended include hand washing, covering one's mouth during both, maintaining social distancing, monitoring and self-isolation from persons suspected of having an infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control and workplace closures.
The pandemic has led to severe international socio-economic disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages due to tense buying and selling.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus is circulating online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against people from China, East and Southeast Asian regions and similar origins, and other regions with significant levels of exposure.
Air pollution and CO2 emissions have decreased as travel has decreased and heavy industry has been closed.
On 31 December 2019, health officials in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported that a large number of people had contracted pneumonia without a known cause, and that investigations into the disease had begun as early as January 2020.
These patients were mostly contacts of the Huan'an seafood wholesale market, so the pathogen is thought to have an animal-borne origin.
The pathogen known as SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered pathogen most closely related to the swallow corona virus, ant corona virus and SARS-CoV. The first person known to have developed symptoms was diagnosed with a medical condition on 1 December 2019 and it was later determined that the person had no apparent association with the meat market package.
In the initial batch of cases in December 2019, two-thirds were identified as having been exposed to the market.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 claimed that a 55-year-old patient from Hubei Province may have been the first patient and that it may have occurred on November 17, 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on February 26 that while new cases in China have declined, the number of new cases arriving for treatment outside China has exceeded the number arriving for treatment in China for the first time due to sudden increases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Significantly underreported infections, especially among people with mild symptoms, may be present.
As of 26 February, relatively few young cases have been reported, with only 2.4% of those worldwide aged 19 and under.Patrick Valens, Chief Scientific Adviser for the UK, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
These are the number of people tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be in compliance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have official policies not to test people with moderate symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of 23 January were undetected, and these undetected infections spread the disease to 79% of confirmed patients.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that there may be significantly higher infections in Italy than publicly reported.
The baseline estimates of baseline reproductive factor (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people affected by COVID-19 are recovering regularly.
For those who do not, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age and 75% of these patients had pre-existing conditions including heart disease and diabetes.Only confirmed cases of coronavirus disease and deaths are generally counted in the official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher as it may not include those who die without being tested - e.g. at home, nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official coronavirus death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""[the death toll] is known to be underestimated"", a statement confirmed by a small number of profile reports in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during epidemics, as was the case with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on 14 February.
Even before February 28, dozens of deaths were reported outside mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
The numbers vary over time depending on the region, and are determined by the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health from onset of disease to present. The patient count and mortality rate are obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of patients diagnosed in a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global case fatality rate as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the ratio between cases and deaths decreased from 17.3% (asymptomatic from 1 -10 January 2020) to 0.7% (asymptomatic after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the patient mortality rate (CFR-CFR), which reflects the percentage of confirmed cases of a disease that causes death, and the infection mortality rate (IFR-IFFR), which reflects the percentage of those who die from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These figures are not time-bound and the method of treatment is to follow a specific group of infected people.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the mortality rate from infection during the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and duration of outbreaks are uncertain and may vary by location.
"Maggie Bonney of Penn State University says that ""when unverified, infection usually reaches an unchanged peak, then the infectious organisms (hosts) begin to decline at the beta level"."
"But it is almost impossible to foresee any sensible plan at present as to when it will be".
"Zhang Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, suggested that if all countries could be mobilized to follow the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it would be completed by June"".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""is definitely going to be in circulation, and it will last for a year or two""".
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, ""physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (which may take 18 months or more)".
"I cannot imagine that the coronavirus will disappear completely because it is so easily transmitted", and it "may become a seasonal disease and return every year", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The severity of the outbreak will depend on the immunity of the population and the genetic diversity of the pathogen.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively undefined and those who have been infected may be symptomatic.
Both fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) are common symptoms.
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory cramps (irritability), loss of sensation of consumption, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, itching, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea or blueness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluing of the face or lips as symptoms of an emergency. Seeking immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Since some of the infected are asymptomatic and have no clinical symptoms and are confirmed to be infected according to the results of anal testing, the researchers have advised that those in close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and tested to ensure that they are free from infection.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic rate range is small, from 44% to 50%.
The typical incubation period (the interval between onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is usually five days. An example of uncertainty is that the estimated loss of facial sensation in COVID-19 patients was initially 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be transmitted primarily through close contact, small droplets of residue formed during coughing, sneezing or speaking, with close contact being between 1 and 2 metres (3 and 6 ft) apart.
Studies have shown that when the mouth is left unclosed, droplets of ash can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) away to as much as 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the small droplets that can be released during speech can be spread through air, as well. Although the pathogen is not usually airborne, respiratory droplets can be released during exhalation, including during speech.
Fluid droplets can pass into the mouth or nose of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can spray the bronchial glands, which can result in airborne transmission of the pathogen.
It can be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While concerns that it could spread through feces are raised, the likelihood of such a risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to spread from feces to the mouth. The infectivity of the virus is highest during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although pre- and post-contagious transmission is possible.
A few people have been confirmed to have been infected three days before the onset of symptoms, thus suggesting that the infection may have spread before the onset of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports have been lab-confirmed as asymptomatic infections, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified during contact tracing investigations by some countries.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although there is no clear information on how the disease is transmitted, we know that one person can usually spread the infection to two to three people.
In particular, the pathogen has been found to survive on polypropylene and 304 grade steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature. COVID-19 has been confirmed to affect pets and other animals as well.
Although there is no evidence that animals can transmit the pathogen to humans, British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals, as if infected people had touched them after contact with other surfaces.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2) is a novel pathogen that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia who came into contact with a group of patients with severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 occur naturally in the associated coronaviruses. The pathogen is killed by household soap as it dissolves its protective coatings outside the human body. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought that it may have originally spread from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the sarcophagus (gene B) within the genus of the corona virus, beta corona virus, is a common species with two fibers from bats.
This is 96% of the total genome of other bat coronaviruses (bat corona RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in specific regions of the genome sequence between pathogens derived from ants and pathogens transmitted to humans.
To date, the 92% similarity in shared genetic material between the ant coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome comparison is not sufficient to demonstrate that the ants are intermediate hosts.
The presence of a pathogenic infection can be tentatively detected by symptomatic means, but only by means of antigenic transcription multiplexing (ART-PCR) from infected tissue or CT scan.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to CT suggested that although many graphical aspects of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT can show results with significantly greater clarity than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CTs should not be used as a first-line test or screening test for the diagnosis of COVID-19""".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Test antigenic replication uses multi-modal enzyme transcription (RRT-PCR) in real time.
It can be tested on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Although a throat swab can also be used, in general, this test is performed on the nasal cavity. Several laboratories and companies are developing urological test methods to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be authorised for widespread use.
The spectroscopy test system developed by Selex is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories in the United States.
Characteristic features of radiographs and radiographic diagrams (CDs) on people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral glare opacities and non-bular fluids.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international web-based database of standard draft findings for confirmed infectious persons.
The use of normal drafting without PCR confirmation is particularly useful in identifying COVID-19 as it is associated with other infections such as adenocarcinoma.
A large-scale study in China has shown that comparing chest CT results with PCR is less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis of infection by the drawing method, but it is faster and shows immediate results, suggesting that CT can be considered a tool to determine the impact of infection.
Artificial intelligence-based transformative neural networks have been developed to detect the draft characteristics of the pathogen with both X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and performing actions such as coughing or sneezing on a tissue and placing that tissue directly in a garbage bin.
Those already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.Many governments have imposed travel bans to countries and regions affected by the disease and against all non-essential travel.
However, in most parts of the world, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission.
This means that the pathogen is spreading within communities and some community members may not know where or how they got the infection. It is recommended that regular precautions, such as contact precautions and eye protection, are taken when caring for people who may be infected. Contact monitoring is a key tool for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The use of location data provided by mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised controversies over privacy violations, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on the use of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, including logging user proximity with other mobile phones using Bluetooth, etc.
Users receive a text message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are being spread about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and mouth with a mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, various organizations are working on developing one.
Hand washing and rubbing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with a hand sanitizer and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or looking at dirty hands; before eating; after rinsing the nose; and after coughing or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the pathogen is killed by household soap, which breaks down its protective bubble.
The CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands properly.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a variety of solvents (within one minute of disinfecting the steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povitone-iodine.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in places where COVID-19 is suspected, or where there are confirmed cases, such as offices or day care centers, office areas, restrooms, common areas used by people with health issues, and common electronic devices such as mobile phones, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, cash machines, etc., be disinfected.
Health agencies recommend that people bend their elbows or cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people with infection as wearing a mask will limit the amount of water droplets released during exhalation, which are dispersed during speaking, sneezing and sneezing, and the distance travelled.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a pathologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask will reduce people's tendency to touch their face when lack of proper hand hygiene is a significant factor in the spread of infection"" and caregivers of people who may have been infected are also recommended to wear masks".
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-used medical face masks made of fabric.China has specifically recommended that healthy people use foldable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without wearing masks or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that everyone going to public places wear masks to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since March, has mandated that passengers on trains and intercity buses wear masks from 1 April.
Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory whenever going outdoors, while recommending that those who cannot afford a mask make a mask at home.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is the practice of limiting close contact between individuals to delay the spread of disease.
The measures include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, sports grounds, cinemas or shopping malls.
Individuals can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments mandate or recommend social distancing in areas with outbreaks.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was reduced from 250 (if a region is known to have no COVID-19 outbreak) to 50 and then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the confinement of more than two people in public spaces. The CDC advises that older people and people with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immunodeficiency, are at higher risk of serious health disorders and complications and that such people should stay indoors as much as possible in areas with community transmission. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations began using the term ""social distancing"" to describe ""social distancing"" for the homeless, or to describe the use of "social distancing"" to reduce contact with strangers, or to reduce contact with the same body, in a way that is understood by the general public".
The use of the phrase "social distancing" has led to the view that people should be completely isolated from society, rather than encouraging alternative ways of interacting with one another. Some authorities have even issued sexual health guidelines to be used during outbreaks.
These include the recommendation that if you live with a person who is not infected or has no symptoms of the disease, you should only have sex with them.
People who are positive for COVID-19 and suspected of being positive are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended that the entire population living in affected areas self-isolate.
Strong self-isolation guidelines have been issued for groups at high risk of transmission.
Those who are considered to have been in contact with someone who is likely to have COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a high prevalence of the disease are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their last exposure.
Control or suppression and mitigation are strategies to control the impact of disease.
Control measures are being taken in the early stages of the outbreak, aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, and introducing other measures to control the outbreak and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are reversed to mitigation: measures are taken to reduce the spread and mitigate its impact on the health system and society.
Prevention and mitigation can be combined.
More intensive efforts are needed in suppression of measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproductive count to less than 1. This is known as flattening the epidemic curve, an effort to reduce epidemic peak as part of managing the spread of infectious disease.
This reduces the risk of major outbreaks that cannot be addressed by health services and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the spread include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, mask-wearing and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also took various measures to contain the spread of the disease.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about moving infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who were affected and isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has also imposed fines for smuggling medical supplies that increase mask production.Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show major challenges in mitigation (preventing but not stopping the spread of cholera) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic).
Better prevention policies can reduce the demand for primary health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but they will result in tens of thousands of deaths and disruption of health systems.
Suppression can be a priority, but it must be maintained until the pathogen spreads in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), as a rapid re-spread can occur when measures are relaxed.
The long-term disruption to the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There is no specific antimicrobial drug against COVID-19 infection, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cough medications, drinking fluids and taking rest may help to limit symptoms.
Depending on the severity, life support, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can worsen the effects.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other pathogenic diseases are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that certain ""traditional and home remedies"" can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19. "
Capacity building and healthcare adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients are described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a basic response to the disease.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at multiple levels, including centralization of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, elimination of non-mandatory procedures as far as possible, isolation and quarantine of COVID-19 infected patients and increasing intensive care capacities through training of staff and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first infected person (known as Patient Zero) first became infected.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei had gradually increased.
These were often connected to the Huan'an seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the pathogen came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, that it was of animal origin. A pneumonia batch of unknown cause was diagnosed on December 26 and treated by Hubei Provincial Hospital doctor Zhang Jixian, who reported it to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC (CDC) on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization (WHO).
In early January, health authorities in Wuhan were notified of insufficient cases of undiagnosed pneumonia, enough to initiate investigations.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
With the help of migration and transportation during the Chinese New Year, and the fact that Wuhan is a major transportation hub and crossroads, the virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020.
On 20 January, China recorded almost 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms, according to later official data.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.9 As of April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
There was at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the massive spread of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement between them and have imposed border controls.
National responses include quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India under lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people were under some form of lockdown globally, a situation that increased to 2.6 billion two days later - a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Wuhan was on 1 December 2019; according to another unconfirmed report, the first confirmed case was on 17 November 2019.
Dr. Zhang Jixian diagnosed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26 and was notified to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC (CDC) on December 27 by the hospital where he worked.
Initial genetic analysis of samples from the patient on 27 December 2019 indicates the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on the same day.
"Once the announcements were made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan that they were 'spreading rumours' about the outbreak".
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially insisted that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched an aggressive campaign that was described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China, as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the pathogen".
"In what has been described as the 'biggest lockdown in human history,' a sanitary curfew was announced on January 23 to suspend travel in and out of Wuhan, affecting a total of 57 million people, including a total of 15 cities in Hubei".
The use of private transportation is banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The temporary hospital, HuoshenShan Hospital, was built in 10 days and completed, officials said.
Another hospital, Leishension Hospital, was built to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and sports stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices to travellers and extending the festival holiday in the spring.
Schools and universities across the country were closed.
Several activities were undertaken in the areas of Hong Kong and Macau, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working activities were established in many Chinese circles.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation has been reversed and museums across China are temporarily closed.
"With public movement restrictions imposed in many cities, it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) face some form of outdoor restrictions. Since the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken drastic measures to prevent the pathogen from ""importing"" from other countries".
For example, Beijing had imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travelers entering the city.On 23 March, only one case had been reported domestically in mainland China, up to five days earlier, and that was from a traveller traveling from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the disease had been contained domestically and that the spread in China was under control.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26 that entry permits for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28. No specific details were given on when the policy would expire.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged the reopening of businesses and factories, and provided cash incentive packages to those businesses. The State Council announced that it would begin a day of national mourning with a three-minute silence at 10:00 a.m. on 4 April, which was coordinated with the Qingming Festival.
The transmission of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The country's health agency said the number of confirmed cases had risen significantly on February 20, attributed to a clash in Daegu on behalf of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
It is suspected that Shincheonji pilgrims visiting Daegu from Wuhan will be exposed to the outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 people who follow that church, 1,261 or 13 percent have reported symptoms.South Korea issued a high-level alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been closed after three soldiers were confirmed to have been infected.
Flight schedules were also affected, so they were rescheduled.South Korea introduced what is considered the world's largest and best-organized program to detect the spread of the virus among the general population, isolate them if infected, and track down and isolate contacts.
Diagnostic measures include mandatory self-reporting of new international travellers with symptoms via mobile app, drive-through testing for pathogenic exposure based on the results of the next day and increasing testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
Although not isolating entire cities, South Korea's plan is considered successful in containing the spread. Initially, there were two conflicting opinions in South Korean society about President Moon Jae-in's actions in handling the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions praising Moon for his good performance or calling for his dismissal because of the government's mismanagement of the epidemic.
On 23 March, South Korea reported its lowest single-day infections in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.
According to media reports on 1 April, South Korea had received requests from 121 different countries for help in testing the virus.

Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani had said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to isolate the affected areas and only individuals would be quarantined.
Despite plans to limit inter-city travel announced as early as March, heavy inter-city traffic continued ahead of the Persian New Year's Eve.
Shia places of worship in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the epicenter of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the extent of the spread in Iran, more than a dozen countries had found their infections originating from Iran by 28 February, suggesting that this could be much higher than the 388 infections reported by Iran on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members were reportedly confirmed to have the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders jailed for peacefully protesting and to provisionally release all eligible prisoners.
The risk of spread of the pathogen is reported to be higher in enclosed areas in all directions where there is insufficient medical care, such as detention centres.
On March 15, the Iranian government said there were 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number reported since the outbreak began in the country.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, there were 50 new cases of coronavirus in Iran every hour and one death every ten minutes.
World Health Organization (WHO) officials believe that there may have been five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It is also said that Iran's financial capacity to contain the spread of the virus may have been affected by US sanctions on Iran.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The spread was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January after two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all air services with China and declare a state of emergency.
An uncontacted batch of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced new arbitration legislation to curb the spread, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
"Prime Minister Gusev Konte said that no entry and exit will be allowed in the outbreak areas".
"Working activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in those areas. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country as the country reached 100 deaths. ""
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all games were postponed for at least a month altogether.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies.The Italian College of Emotional Difficulty, Pain Relief, Cardiac Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) on 6 March issued medical protocols containing recommendations on how to treat the condition based on the severity of the infection.

As of 5 April, the number of confirmed cases in Italy stands at 128,948, with 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, most of which have occurred in the Lombardy region.
The CNN report indicated that Italy's high elderly population and the inability to test everyone with the virus to date may have contributed to the higher mortality rate.
The United Kingdom has been the most aggressive of the countries affected by the virus, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government has not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its lack of speed and intensity in addressing the concerns facing the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a notice advising against all non-essential travel and social interaction, recommending that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and cinemas.
On 20 March, the government announced that entertainment establishments such as restaurants and gyms should close as soon as possible and promised to provide 80 per cent of wages to workers up to £2,500 per month to avoid the unemployment crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister imposed strict social distancing measures and a ban on gatherings of more than two people, along with restrictions on travel and outdoor activities that are deemed necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the restrictions were enforced by the police through the imposition of fines and the dismissal of gatherings.
"Most other business establishments were ordered to close, except for businesses considered ""essential"", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and auto repair shops".

On January 28, 2020, the US government's leading public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control, announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States began testing slowly, which obscured the true extent of the infection at the time.
The test was marred by defective test kits produced by the Central Government in February, lack of Central approval for non-governmental test kits (via academia, institutions and hospitals) by the end of February and restrictive criteria for people to be eligible for testing until early March (after which a doctor's prescription was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
"On March 22, the Associated Press reported: ""Many with symptoms had to wait for hours or days for a doctor's prescription and testing"."

On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency assistance programs for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and control the spread of the disease.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted a major shift between the situation during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities kept the information secret and hampered prevention and control efforts, and the current situation. During the current crisis, the central government ""provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays"."
"On January 23, referring to the decision by central authorities to impose a curfew in Wuhan, WHO representative Gautan Kaleya said that while ""this is certainly not recommended by WHO"" it is "a very important sign of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the worst affected area". He added that "it is unprecedented in the history of public health". This is the first time since January 30, 2009, that the WHO has declared a pandemic of international public health concern (IPHEP) due to the increasing number of cases and the fact that human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in other countries outside China.
"The WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom" said that the PHEIC was "declared to be a risk for global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack strong health systems".
"Speaking about the travel restrictions being put in place, Tedros said that ""measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade are unnecessary"" and that ""the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend reducing trade and movement"".
"Deterring the urgent need to help countries that lack the systems to detect those infected even when it has emerged, the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed to the global community on 5 February for a contribution of $675 million in strategic preparedness funding in low-income countries".
Tedros also issued statements that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "try today or lose more later". On 11 February, WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease at a press conference.
"On the same day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he had agreed to provide 'the strength of the entire UN system to confront this.'"
"The result was the creation of a United Nations Crisis Management Panel, which would coordinate information provided by all UN agencies. This would help to focus on health information while other agencies provide their expertise to address the impact of the pandemic on broader social, economic and developmental efforts", the WHO said.
"On 14 February, a joint WHO-led task force was deployed with China to assist China in domestic management, to conduct workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions to assess ""the severity and transmission of the disease"" and to conduct field studies to assess ""the impact of containment measures at the provincial and state levels, including urban and rural settings"" to provide assistance to international and World Health Organization (WHO) experts in the field in China. On 25 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that ""the world must be prepared for the possible spread of the MENA virus"" and that countries must be in a ""precautionary phase"" before it can be called a pandemic, even if the country is still in a state of emergency".
"In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, a joint mission team was sent there by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials announced that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from ""high"" to ""very high"", the highest level of alert and risk assessment available".
"The executive director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergencies Programme, Mike Ryan, warned in a statement, ""This is a reality check for every government in the world: wake up".
"The virus could be coming, so you have to be prepared", he stressed, adding that the right containment measures would help the world avoid ""its worst part"".
"Ryan added that current data did not warrant a declaration by public health authorities that it was a global pandemic, saying that if it were, it would mean that ""we have accepted that every human being on the planet is susceptible to the disease""".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming inaction", the Director-General said. The WHO has faced significant criticism for what it considers to be inadequate response to the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the pathogen as a pandemic.
A petition that had 733,000 signatures as of April 6 calling for the resignation of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom, is part of the backlash.
On 26 March 2020, UN human rights experts called for the rights of every individual to be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Panel of Experts said that everyone has the right to life-saving measures and the Government has a duty to do so.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be seen as a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
The experts stressed that all individuals have a right to healthcare, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, those in detention, refugees and any other undefined group that may require government support.
Intergovernmental organizations have begun their work to address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy, to addressing the effects of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the Digital Hub includes a country policy observer and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has come under criticism for its handling of the outbreak, which began in China's Hubei province, by US, UK Cabinet Office Ambassador Michael Cove and Brazil's Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of President Jair Bolsonaro.
Several provincial-level CPC officials were fired for their handling of isolationist efforts in central China, seen as a sign of dissatisfaction with the measures taken by the party's administration in those regions to contain the spread.
Some critics believe the move was made to protect Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier acknowledgments that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favour of collaborative theories that the origin of COVID-19 may have come from the United States or Italy.
"The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus"" or ""the Wuhan virus"", saying that China's ""controls exaggerated a virus that has become a global pandemic"" and was criticized by some critics as racist and ""a diversion from his administration's failure to control the disease"".
"The Daily Beast received a US government report outlining a communications plan from the National Security Council, quoting the strategy that 'it's all about China.'"
"We are told that the message must reach us in some way, including through a press conference and a TV appearance. " "Publications such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg say China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda campaign aimed at global influence".
"The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that there is a geopolitical component, including a 'struggle for influence through manipulation and the politics of liberalism,'" he said.
"Unlike the United States, China is actively promoting its commitment to being a responsible and reliable partner", Borrell said.
China has called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to two countries that are lagging behind.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
US officials are also accused of diverting funds from other countries back to their own countries.
Discussions on mask use have been reported between countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators that were to be shipped to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU for its irresponsibility towards Italy, which was hit hard by the coronavirus.
"Italy's ambassador to the EU, Maurizio Mazzari, said China was the only country to respond in a bilateral action".
"Of course, this is not a good sign for European unity".
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
"Italy's La Stampa newspaper, citing an unnamed ""high-level political source"", said 80 percent of Russian aid was ""useless or of little use to Italy"".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" propaganda.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
"When we come forward to provide aid to our American counterparts, [Putin] believes that the Americans will return the same aid if necessary, when the production of medical equipment and supplies in the United States accelerates instead", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"The largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War, the Defender 2020 military exercise, will be conducted on a small scale in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states".
"Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary-General Kate Hudson has criticized Defender 2020 exercise: ""In the current public health crisis, it affects not only the lives of troops from the US and several European countries participating in the event, but also the lives of the people of the countries where the event takes place. The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament and fifteen current or former political figures infected".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter on 14 March 2020 asking international leaders for help, saying that his country was stumbling in its fight against the spread of the pandemic as a result of the US sanctions against Iran, which have left it unable to access international markets. The pandemic has reinforced calls for the US to adopt social policies commonly adopted in other wealthy countries, including health care, childcare for all, paid family leave and a large allocation of funds to public health.
Political analysts expect it to have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated.
"South Korea has criticized Japan's ""obscure and hostile isolation efforts"" following its announcement that people arriving from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites".
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's decisions to deal with the crisis.
Several Koreans signed petitions calling for a criminal investigation of Moon and praising his response, citing their claims that the government had mismanaged the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament has voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to be sworn in indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those deemed to have spread misinformation about the government's handling of the pandemic and crisis.
The coronavirus pandemic has caused a number of incidents including supply shortages, over-use of equipment to combat infection globally, over-purchases due to unjustified fear and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in the supply of products.
Many areas have been hit by panic buying and shortages of essential groceries such as food, toilet paper and putty water.
The tech sector had specifically warned that there would be a delay in the export of electronics.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a rise of up to twenty times the normal price and delayed the supply of medical supplies by four to six months.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization (WHO) warns could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for traders known as Tykov to sell Australian goods into China.
The activity was later banned by the Australian government due to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets.Despite the high impact of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food items, both regions survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against smuggling and illicit trade of critical products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with significant agricultural output, has not seen a major decline in production, but industry representatives expect prices to rise.
Even in Wuhan, food shelves were temporarily empty as Chinese government officials released pork stockpiles to ensure that the public had enough food to eat.
Italy also has laws requiring food manufacturers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, as a result of government measures to contain the spread of the virus, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As the Chinese mainland is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the spread of the pathogen is seen as the greatest threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agde Demirayes of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until the possible consequences are clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn caused by the current pandemic would be greater than the one caused by the SARS pandemic in 2002-2004.
An expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the impact on the global supply chain could be more than $300 billion in less than two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was put on the spot as oil prices plummeted due to a drop in Chinese purchasing demand.
Global stock markets plunged on 24 February as the number of COVID-19 infections outside mainland China increased significantly.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock market indices, including the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their fastest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three stocks fell by more than 10% over the weekend.
On 28 February, Scope, the certification company GmbH, confirmed China's sovereign currency rating but extended a negative forward perspective.
Stocks fell again due to the coronavirus scare, with the highest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people are predicting a recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Arian praised the timely and emergency measures taken by central banks and the Aras.
Central banks are acting much faster than they reacted during the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism sector has been one of the hardest hit by travel restrictions, closure of public places including travel destinations and advice from governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the UK's regional carrier Flybe has suffered a decline.
The cruise industry has been impacted in an unprecedented way.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Sun Yun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many events involving large gatherings, including annual New Year celebrations, were canceled by national and regional governments, and private companies have closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland independently.
Various New Year's Eve events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid crowds, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple sights in Beijing.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, advising most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong, which raised the epidemic response rate to its highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools and cancelled New Year's celebrations until March.The retail sector has been hit globally by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60% decline.
This is a decrease of 33-43% in the number of customers in the outlets in March compared to February.
Additional measures such as increased sanitation measures, installation of thermal scanners to test the temperature of shoppers and cancellation of events were taken by shopping mall operators around the world, with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimating that the pandemic-induced recession would put between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty compared to a situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
More than 300 million of China's suburban migrant workers are stuck at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could cause 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (daily wage earners) unemployed. An Angus Read survey found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of work experience.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers were claiming temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers were also applying under the Universal Credit scheme.
France and the UK follow Germany's short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, affecting the operations of companies and individuals - permanent and freelancers - globally.
Art and culture sector organisations have tried to perpetuate their (mostly publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and at various scales are cancelling or postponing and closing their exhibitions, events and performances indefinitely.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapid consequence of the outbreak is the cancellation of religious services, important sporting events, as well as other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome during the final week of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay safe at home rather than attend Sunday prayer meetings; some churches offer church services on radio, live broadcast or television, and some offer drive-in worship services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese closed its churches and other religious organizations such as churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and clergy have cancelled their services and restricted the gathering of the public following the expulsion of Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas, followed by the closure of mosques, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own citizens from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to the conduct of sporting events globally since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the IOC announced on 24 March that the event would be ""postponed to a date beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021""".Casinos and other sporting venues worldwide remain closed and live poker tournaments are postponed or cancelled".
This has led to many gamblers moving to the Internet, which has led to many online gambling sites significantly increasing their fees for new entrants. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many big theatres like Broadway have also suspended all shows.
"Some artists have found new ways to produce and share performances online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live-streamed concerts or creating web-based ""festival"" events for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, a number of coronavirus-themed internet memes have caused humor and distraction for many amid the instability.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, people of Chinese and East Asian heritage have been subjected to a high level of discrimination, xenophobia and ethnic bigotry against people in Europe, the United States and other countries most affected by the pandemic.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific regions.
Reports in February (with most of the impact in China alone) documented racist sentiments expressed against various groups of Chinese people around the world, such as the claim that you deserve to be pathogenic, or that this is a fair punishment.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many of the residents of Wuhan and Hubei have complained of discrimination based on their regional origin.
The affected areas received assistance from China both online and in person.
People from Italy, the first country to have an active COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, will also face suspicion and racism following the intensification of the spread to new tropical countries.Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese and other Asian nationals in the UK and US have reported increasing racist abuse and attacks against them.
"U.S. President Donald Trump's use of the term 'Chinese pathogen' for the coronavirus has been criticized as racist and anti-Chinese by critics".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from the North Eastern states of India, which share a border with China and are staying in other major cities of India, have reportedly been disrupted by the spread of the coronavirus.
"The Chinese have destroyed nature and 'God is taking revenge on them for it,'" said BJP West Bengal State Committee chairman Dilip Ghosh.
"These comments were later denounced as ""wrong"" by the Chinese Consulate General in Calcutta. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese has been exacerbated by an epidemic of "foreign junk" and "throwbacks" of foreigners living there".
Many newspapers have removed the subscriber-only display of electronic newsletters on their websites to provide partial or complete coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers on epidemiology available for anyone to read.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods to detect the presence of the pathogen and other antibodies produced in response to infection.
RT-PCR method for detecting RNA of coronavirus has confirmed the presence of the virus in samples.
The test is designed to detect only one specific and eripholipid (RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
Other antibody detection methods (photosensitivity) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Other antibody tests show how many people have been affected, including those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic.
The results of the trial will be able to determine the exact mortality rate and herd immunity from the disease in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the pathogenicity of their total population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests varies widely between countries.
This variant may significantly affect reported mortality rates, and is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Real-time retroscripting polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to test on respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal pancreatitis or colic sampling.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR, which is performed by swab sampling from the throat, can give reliable results only in the first week of the disease onset.
The pathogen then disappears into the throat, but it reaches the lungs and continues to multiply there.
During the second week of testing, patients may be tested with a suction tube from the airway or with a coughing cold (calamine) as an alternative sample.
One of the earliest PCR trials was developed in January 2020 at Saride in Berlin using the real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be deployed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had developed testing methods as of 23 January 2020. South Korean company CoGeneBiotech developed a PCR-based, clinical grade SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It targets the ""E"" genome shared by all beta coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp genome. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Pharmaceutical Administration of China to use PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing its 2019-nCoV-PCR-based real-time SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for public health through the International Health Regulatory Forum (IHRC) ".
Testing at the CDC in Atlanta was disrupted when one of three genetic tests in previous versions of the kits produced ambiguous results due to faulty test materials, resulting in an average of fewer than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, tests using the two components have not been determined to be reliable, and until then state and local laboratories have not been allowed to conduct tests.
The trial was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization and commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting trials in early March 2020.
As of 5th March 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing systems are available nationwide.
As on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics has facilitated nationwide COVID-19 testing.
No dose limits have been announced; sample collection and processing should be done in accordance with the conditions recommended by CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test system was developed and manufactured by the State Research Center for Toxicology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
The trial was registered on 11 February 2020 by the Service of the Surveillance Trust in Health Care.On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test system to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a test system that would perform the maximum test in 3.5 hours, meaning that a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test with Abbott's M2000 system; similar authorization has previously been granted to Hologic, LabCorp and ThermoFisher Scientific by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On March 21, 2020, Zepid received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a test procedure that takes 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal culture technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require alternating temperature cycles, the system can provide positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States, and Abbott is looking to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.A test system using a single-cylinder microchip specifically bonded with the novel coronavirus's endothelial protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan.Hopes have been raised that if successful, it could provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the rapid sputum test.
"A March 2020 review article commented that ""chest x-rays are less likely to diagnose in the early stages, while CT [CT-computed tomography] results may even show pre-symptom presentation"."
Common features in CT include bilateral polymorphism with external, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
When the disease progresses, there is a subclavian obstruction, a distended airway and stiffness.
A study comparing PCR to CT at the start of the current outbreak in Wuhan suggested that although many of the graphical features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT can show results with significantly greater clarity than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test or first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19""". As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of PCR for early testing".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to diagnose infection in people 7 or more days after onset of symptoms, determine immunity, and monitor populations. Evaluation can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or at points of care testing (PoCT-POCT).
These assessments can be performed by high-performance automated systems in many medical laboratories, but their availability depends on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLD, although series of samples may be used to mimic immune response.
For PoCT, a small hole is usually drilled into the skin and a sample of blood is taken.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-evaluation extraction is not required. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 26 March 2020 published the names of 29 companies that are currently certified to distribute their other antimicrobial tests, providing information to the agency as required.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.EuroImmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epidop Diagnostics, which develops test kits to detect antibodies to IgG and IgA from blood samples, received European approvals for their test kits in late March 2020.
It is capable of testing several hundred samples within a few hours and will provide results much faster than conventional PCR assay of pathogenic RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.They found in early April that none of the antibody testing kits purchased by the UK were suitable for use.
"Hong Kong has a programme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "spout a sample into a tube provided to the patient by the emergency department, and return it shortly afterwards to receive a test result. A programme of home testing of suspected patients is run by the British NHS to avoid the risk of infection to others if the patient arrives at the hospital or to reduce the activity of the disinfectant if a vector is used. A health professional who tests for COVID-19 for suspected patients uses the precautionary measures to collect samples".
Drive-through centers have greatly helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests of any country. The mobile system has the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day, with 10,700 tests conducted last week, the National Association of Forensic Physicians in Germany said on March 2,
The cost of a medical examination is covered by the health insurance company.
According to Robert Koch, CEO of the company, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, in-vehicle testing was provided in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted there is unknown as Germany reports only the number of confirmed test results.
"In the first laboratory study, researchers from Technion and Ram Ram Hospital in Israel developed and tested a system to simultaneously test samples from 64 patients, so that samples could be collected and tested only if they were combined positive. A laboratory lab temporarily located in Wuhan, China, on an area of 2000 square meters, with the name ""Hu-Yuan"" (Chinese: 火眼 or ""Beiji"" in English) could be designated as a "Base of Investigation" (BGI) on 10 000 samples in 2020".
The sample methods show that if the test system developed in 5 days under the direct supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian had not been implemented, the number of cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of dealing with the quarantine would have doubled.
Hu-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have been systematically imitating the operations of the Wuhan lab.
By March 4, 2020, the daily efficiency is 50,000 tests per day in total. Open source, multiplex designs published by Origami Evaluations have been released, which can test 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 evaluations. These standardized designs can be run in small labs without the need for robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, shortages of testing material and insufficient stockpiles had become a barrier to large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This led some creators to explore sample preparation protocols that require the release of RNA genomes to be heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to be tested. It was announced on 31 March that the UAE is testing its population more extensively than other countries and is on track to increase the testing volume with a view to testing a majority of its population.
"This is done through the purchase of a drive-through facility and a high-performance laboratory (based on the ""Hu-Yin"" emergency diagnostic laboratories in China) from Group 42 and BGI".
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory operating outside China with such capacity globally.
Different test procedures targeting different parts of the coronavirus genome profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO adopted the German formula to produce kits for sending to low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own.
The German follow-up process was released on 17 January 2020; testing in the US was delayed due to the lack of protocols developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of 28 January. The US and China had some issues with the reliability of testing kits in the early stages of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the testing and requirements required by health experts.
Instead, South Korea's large-scale testing has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, experts say.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up by the South Korean government over many years.
The World Health Organization advised on 16 March that speeding up testing programs was the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. Due to the need for high-volume testing due to the increasing spread of the pathogen, hundreds of thousands of tests were pending in private laboratories in the US, and the availability of bread and chemical test materials was difficult.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of its testing equipment.
"In the United States, testing kits developed by the CDC had ""defects"" and the government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but the results were found to be incorrect".
The company explained that the wrong results could have been the result of errors in sampling or in the correct use of the equipment.
The Spanish Ministry said it would recall the kits that had given incorrect results and provide a different test kit supplied by Shenzhen BioEC instead. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia from China were found to be inaccurate.
"Prime Minister Matovic recommended that they be thrown into the Danube. Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a ""high error rate"" and were ""unable to be put into service""", said Ate Kara, Minister of Health of Turkey. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but declared them unfit for use in early April 2020".
Testing and isolation process for tracing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and contacts has produced positive results.
Researchers from the Italian city of Vaud, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of tests at the site with a population of about 3,400, about ten days apart.
Half of the confirmed cases had no symptoms and all confirmed cases were isolated.
This eliminated new infections altogether, as travel to the municipal hall was restricted.
Despite the absence of strict restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus infection in Singapore has spread at a much slower pace than in other developed countries due to the intensity of contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
Several events have been cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began advising its residents to stay at home, but schools reopened in time after the holiday break on 23 March.
Several countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have adopted a low-intensity lockdown while actively managing the spread of the pandemic through contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
In a statistical study, the countries that tested the most had the lowest death rates compared to the death toll, because people in these countries could be found to be mild or asymptomatic.
WHO recommends that countries lacking adequate testing facilities and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their top five confirmed samples and top ten confirmed COVID-19 negative samples to one of the 16 recommended laboratories of the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmatory testing.
Out of 16 recommended laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the following chart, the column ""% confirmed on test basis"" is affected by a country's policy on testing methods".
Otherwise, the percentage of test-dependent confirmed cases is higher than in a country that tests only those admitted to hospital, compared to a country that tests all citizens regardless of whether people have symptoms or not.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of removing dirt, oil, germs, or other unwanted items from one's hands.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""critical moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread by feces and mouth".
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or the common cold. For example, they may become infected if they do not wash their hands before touching things such as their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the sinuses).
Five critical moments of a day when hand washing with soap is mandatory: before and after defecation, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child after using the toilet.
After you have run your nose, coughed or sneezed.
After touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic practices associated with medical practices.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical services can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections.
And reduce the mortality rate of home births.
A 2013 study suggests that improved handwashing routines among children under five can help to increase height slightly.
In developing countries, the rates of childhood mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea recurrences by a third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrheal recurrences can be attributed to handwashing with soap. As with automated behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Diarrhoea is a major cause of acute respiratory infections and is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming an estimated 1.8 million lives annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhoea deaths by almost half and deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other health promotion initiatives as part of Water, Sanitation and Sanitation (WASH) schemes.
Hand washing protects against the illnesses transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage as it dries out the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an irritable, irregular skin condition called scurvy or dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times to wash hands with soap to reduce the spread of disease in the fecal-oral route: after using the bathroom (drainage, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing clothes), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food/handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing techniques are needed to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after handling garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. In 2014, Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, the United States was in the middle with 77%, and China was the lowest at 23%. There are now many behavioral changes to encourage the practice of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The Essential Health Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an exemplary measure of the promotion of children's health and education.
The national programme focuses on disinfection twice a year, hand washing with soap and fluoride daily, and brushing teeth daily.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soaps or detergents to water improves the removal of germs from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility of solutions and increase their solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective skin cleanser because the fats and proteins that are the components of organic soil do not dissolve in water immediately.
However, purification is aided by adequate hydration.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria derived from previous uses.
A small number of studies that monitored the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible as the bacteria are carried by the foam.
The CDC still recommends liquid soap with 'hands-free' restrictions.
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted among the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that antimicrobial-resistant organisms are selective in nature due to the use of prescribed antibiotics or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of organisms' antibacterial agents.
Therefore, although antimicrobial strains are not selected in antibacterial soap powder, they may not be effective in the amounts claimed when they are marketed.
In addition to peripheral agents and skin-protective agents, advanced formulations may include pH regulating acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), benzoic acid, which acts as a microbicide, and skin processors (carrot, biofilms, green pepper, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health suggests that consumer tests containing triphosphonate may be as effective as antibacterial tests in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is convenient for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow most rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soap is more effective than cold soapy water in keeping away dirt and bacteria from the natural oil.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based non-toxic hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water alcohol hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) to form a gel or a moisturizer such as glycerin for simple application and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide to water further enhances antimicrobial activity. Cleansers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol-containing cleansers kill bacteria, including co-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE) and tuberculosis, and some pathogens (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinitis, vaccine, syphilis, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubbing detergents with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria on the hands within 30 seconds of use (a decrease of 3.5 in concentration, equivalent to a decrease of 35 decibels) and kill 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 in concentration) of bacteria within 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are best suited to act against bacteria and are less effective against some pathogens.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against norovirus (or norvac) type viruses, a common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The layers and tips of both hands and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
It is recommended to rub both palms and wash fingertips thoroughly, especially when hands are exposed to dirt.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their simplicity and rapid destructive action against microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
Dry skin can occur when alcohol-based hand sanitizers are used frequently, unless irritants and/or skin moisturizers are included in the formula.
The desiccant effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other laxatives to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergy-related dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or high skin resistance to alcohol or rare hand itching due to additives in alcohol.
The attraction is that it is less irritating and less likely to trigger skin inflammation from touch than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the organic matter on the hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers like soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many germs, as the germs still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on their ingredients and composition, and historically mainly alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers have been less effective.
More recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness due to repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions, compounding programs using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and overall antimicrobial activity after use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and instead use ashes or dirt.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microbes, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash acts as a disinfectant because when it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization recommends that soap be replaced by ash or sand when soap is unavailable.
The handwashing regimen recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes the following steps:
Wet your hands in hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended, as standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water will not make a difference.
Rub hands with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap than when using only water.
Press and rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, while long rubbing removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in a dish can make your hands dirty again.
Let dry with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands are prone to infection. The areas that are usually missed without proper cleaning are the thumb, wrist, inter-finger areas and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and particulate tattoos can accommodate microbes.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to avoid drying hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which increases the risk of spreading infection.
There are various low-cost options for handwashing in places where tap-water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a hanging flowerpot or a pot with a suitable drain and/or using ash if developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, "sand-pipes" and other low-cost options.
"A teapot is a simple technique that uses a jug suspended vertically by a rope and consists of a lever and soap bar operated by a foot to pour a small amount of water over the hands".
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about how to dry in public toilets.
Emerging research suggests that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London and sponsored by the Paper Towel Manufacturing Factory and the European Tissue Symposium, compared the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot-air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increases by 194% and the number on the palms by 254%.
Drying hands with an e-air dryer increases the number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing hands and wiping with paper towels, the total number of bacteria in the finger areas decreased on average by 76% and in the palms by 77%. Scientists conducted several tests to see if each type of drying method resulted in cross-infection due to other users in the bathroom and the environment of the room.
The jet-air dryer blows air out at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h;400 mph), which is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and tools and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads germs up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show significant microbial proliferation. A study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated different types of drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizers is an alternative when soap and water are not available during travel.
Alcohol based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
It was made mandatory after Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, discovered the effect of medical hand washing in preventing disease in a hospital setting (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
Medical hand washing is the practice of rubbing each area of the hands with plenty of soap and water or gel for at least 15 seconds.
Rub your hands together.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel as germs can be in the water on the hands.
After drying, use a paper towel to stop the water (which can also open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the re-contamination of hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to eliminate pathogens and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, hand washing is unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
A study shows that regular hand washing and other simple practices can reduce the rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a study paper demonstrating quality hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare settings.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene has been published on the website of the organization for public comment.
A corresponding study was conducted by Witby et al.
Commercial organisations can measure and assess hand hygiene if they need an explanation of how much compliance is with the regulation.
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are ""five moments"" to wash your hands:"
After exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
before work that requires infection prevention, and
After patient care. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap ("drug" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives hand washing fluid the ability to kill germs.
Such disinfection may be desired prior to surgery or in settings where antibiotic-resistant organisms are abundant. A surgery requires a water hose that can be opened and closed to 'wash' one's hands without touching. This can be done by hand, washing with some chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a stylus brush for wiping and another stylus tool for cleaning under fingernails, etc.
All the jewelry must be removed.
The procedure involves washing the hands and forehead to the elbow for usually 2 to 6 minutes.
No need for long scrap times (10 minutes).
The water in the forearm should not be allowed to spill back into the hands.
After hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands before and after visiting an ill person or to use hand sanitizer.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit from hand hygiene was obtained from the first 20% of washing, and the smallest additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap was more than three times as likely to cause foodborne bacterial infection as washing with antibacterial soap. Hand rubbing with an alcohol-based solution was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% compared to hand washing with antibacterial soap.
Soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes in reducing H1N1 influenza A pathogen and clostridium difficile from hands. Obstacles to improving hand hygiene in healthcare settings include educating employees about hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand washes, and providing written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as an inexpensive and essential tool for achieving good health and good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is challenging achieving universal hand washing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing faucets are scarce near private or public toilets despite affordable possibilities to build handwashing facilities.
However, less hand washing may be due to habit rather than to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of handwashing with soap will influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in people.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential to make it work better.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches to increasing handwashing in LMICs were effective, while campaigns through social media were less effective. An example is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", a program to promote handwashing in schools, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum grades are achieved, schools can go from one to three star status.
The establishment of hand washing stations is part of the hand washing promotion campaigns to reduce disease and infant mortality.
Another example of a campaign to raise awareness that seeks to achieve behavioural change is Global Handwashing Day. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have found that the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with DALI was negligible.
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly less costly than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers who give birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis Wije, of Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English ""founder of modern nursing""".
Most people at the time believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called miasma.
After foodborne illness and health-related infections in 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention actively promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 outbreak of swine flu and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters on ""proper hand washing techniques"" are hung near hand washing tanks in public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets in Germany".
"The phrase 'wash one's hands of something' means to declare one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or to share in it".
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate hand washes the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with much wider use in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth frantically begins to wash her hands while trying to clean up a fictional stain, which she believes represents guilt over the crimes she committed and the crimes that prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others after recalling or thinking about immoral acts, and they place a higher value on handwashing equipment.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after this kind of thinking are less likely to engage in other "sanitation" activities such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water, but no soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual hand washing performed in many religions, including the Baha'i faith in Judaism, the Devit and Netalit Yadaim in Hinduism, the Lawab in Christianity, and the Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate that people wash their hands after using the toilet.
Furthermore, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam have made it mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 workplace risk restrictions
Occupational safety and health measures for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are workplace risk controls that are COVID-19 dependent.
The systematic workplace risk controls are based on the workplace and the workplace, sources of risk, severity of disease in the community and risk factors of individual workers who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure hazardous occupations have low levels of work-related contact with the public and other colleagues. Basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to isolate at home if they are sick, following proper respiratory practices, maintaining hygiene in the work environment, and continuing to perform disinfection, are recommended.
Medium risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are likely to be affected, unknown or suspected, such as COVID-19 patients or those who have travelled internationally, due to the current community spread.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, high density work environments and some high volume retail establishments.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include better ventilation using high-performance air filters, sneezing preventers and personal protective equipment that can be worn in case of contact with an affected person of COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high risk of infection. Personnel who are in a position to develop a droplet or who are involved in collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 person are at very high risk of infection.
The optimum risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and appropriate personal protective equipment for the work situation.
COVID-19 infection can have many effects in the workplace.
Workers may miss work due to health problems, caring for others, or fear of infection.
The patterns of business may change due to changes in the goods demanded and the means of procuring them (going to buy goods during off-peak hours or getting them through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, the export of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. An Epidemic Preparedness and Counteraction Plan may be used to guide precautionary measures.
The plans identify the risk levels associated with various workstations and work activities, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community settings and risk factors associated with older persons or individual workers with chronic illness.
They outline the controls needed to avoid risks and the cost-effective outlook for situations that may result from the disease outbreak.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or instructional recommendations.
Goals for responding to infection include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk with serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other companies in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response received.
A hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in the health and safety sectors to group risk controls by performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, engineering controls followed by administrative controls and finally the use of personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Engineering controls include isolating workers from work-related hazards rather than relying solely on the behavior of workers, which is a very cost effective solution.
Management controls are changes in the processes or policies that require the employee or employer to act.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE-PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and management controls, but these can help prevent certain risk-involving situations.
PPE should be selected based on the potential risk to workers, be appropriately fitted (e.g. respirators), similarly, be worn properly, periodically inspected, maintained and replaced if necessary, and properly disposed of, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid sanitary defects.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have low levels of occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
Frequent and proper hand washing, encouraging workers to isolate at home if they are ill, breathing regulations including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, installation of tissue and garbage bins, managing remote working or intermittent working hours if necessary, encouraging workers to avoid using other people's tools and equipment, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment are recommended basic prevention measures for all workplaces.
The early identification and isolation of susceptible persons in a workplace is an important step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, flu-like symptoms, or any other symptoms after not taking medications that reduce fever or relieve other symptoms for at least 24 hours. Medical leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for an ill family member, and informing employees about these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), due to the current community spread around the business area, work that requires frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of a person who is likely, unknown or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as COVID-19 patients or an individual who has recently traveled internationally to an area with a high COVID-19 outbreak is considered a moderate-risk work.
These include workers who have contact with the general public in places such as high-density workplaces and crowded retail establishments. The engineering restrictions that are put in place for such high-risk work groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as colourless dust barriers and installing window-to-window service to provide customer service, including the installation of safety equipment, protective equipment for schools and other high-risk groups, encouraging isolation of ill workers at home, providing information on how to communicate with the public instead of face-to-face contact, setting up a network of information and resources for workers to avoid face-to-face contact, and providing information and resources to workers on how to avoid workplace hazards, such as working with COVID-19, training on how to wear safety equipment, and other measures to prevent illness and/or workplace hazards, such as setting up a network of contact information and/or contact information for workers to avoid workplace hazards, and providing training and/or information about how to use safety equipment, such as hand-helds and/or safety equipment, to protect workers from COVID-19.
Workers in this high-risk group rarely require a ventilator.
If a person becomes ill on the flight, formal measures to protect workers and other passengers, including keeping the sick person 6 feet apart from others, appointing a crew member to serve the sick person, and providing a mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue when vomiting or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear single-use medical gloves when attending to an ill passenger or when touching body fluids or surfaces likely to be infected. Additional personal protective equipment should also be worn if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be stored and disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Risk controls to be taken on commercial ships, including luxury cruise ships and other passenger vessels, include postponing travel and self-isolation if ill and promptly notifying the on-board medical centre if fever or other symptoms occur while on board.
Generally, a person who is quarantined in a room should be screened there.For schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that, regardless of community transmission status, if an infected person was in a school building, the area be closed for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection.
In the case of moderate or low social spread, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as field trips, cancellation of meetings and large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or serving food in a restaurant, increasing the distance between tables, intermittent visit and dismissal times, controlling unwanted visitors and using separate health office space for children with symptoms such as fever.
Extended school closures may be considered a strategy when there is significant spread at the local community level, in addition to social distancing strategies.For law enforcement personnel who understand routine daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the level of immediate health risk to be low.
Law enforcement officials who are in contact with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are also advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during seizure, workwear and clothing should be cleaned and disinfected with household cleaning spray or wipe before use, and general procedures for the allocation and disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE), clothing allocation and washing should be followed.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies some health and morgue workers as either high or very high risk.
Healthcare providers, support, laboratory providers and medical transport workers for known or suspected COVID-19 patients are among those who perform work at high risk of infection.
A high-risk situation is considered if the personnel are engaged in activities such as collecting or handling samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Possible stages of droplets include tubing into the trachea, cough induction procedures, pulmonary exams, certain dental procedures and sample collection by examination or piercing.
High-risk morgue work, including workers involved in preparing bodies of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these become very high exposure risks if autopsy is performed. Additional engineering restrictions for these risk groups include quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be optimal in some health and morgue settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly arrived patients be kept in isolated waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 patients.OSHA recommends that people who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are less than 6 feet away from the person who is being treated wear respirators, in addition to PPE, in cases where there is a risk of infection.
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtered face-face respirators or better are to be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes qualification-testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide greater protection and be more comfortable for staff to wear.The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend full vests as COVID-19 is not a respiratory disease but is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that surgical masks be worn only by personnel working at the point of entry or exit.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, gown and gloves for those collecting, caring for or carrying respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures.
In cases where there is a risk of droplets, N95 or FFP2 respirators are used instead of the surgical mask.
Due to insufficient universal supply of PPE, the WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, allowing only those directly involved in care to enter the room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, and encouraging asymptomatic persons not to use face masks.
This is a great article.

Subject: [COVID-19] Easing workload and preparing for the future
The date/time of the release: 14th March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the interconnectedness of humanity on a global scale and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We have no model for these challenges, but we know that the best response is to work with global empathy, cooperation and community building at the heart of this institution.
The friendliness and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and chats is a remarkable testament to the fact that we have been fortunate to work with such amazing people.
I have nothing to be proud of and thankful for but to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
He reminded me of how important it is that the world is now turning to Wikipedia for information, and that keeping these critical resources online and accessible to all is a powerful sign.
Whatever you've done, whether it's keeping the platforms up and running or giving our colleagues money or helping our communities stay safe, it's your work that makes it possible.
The information that Wikipedia provides is more vital to the world today than ever before.
It's time not only to act, but to do it in a way that makes a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this task and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work together starting this week.
We can also make changes in our work and plans.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the coming days and months.
We discussed what we considered to be the most appropriate response to the situation we faced and the best way to sustain the company at this time.
We were very keen to take the stress off and support our work in the long term.
If you want to reduce the intensity, do it.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
It is our daily work expectation whether it is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you want to work overtime, the job will take full advantage of you.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and you may want to support your loved ones, go grocery shopping or go to the doctor, but your well-being is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
We say it, even though it should not be said.
No need for medical leave or PTO - Help your team edit calendars and action plans and report back to your manager to ensure that the focus is on the key parts of the job.
(If you are confirmed to be affected by COVID-19, please inform Praia in T&C Ops, which will help T&C provide you with the necessary supports and ensure that your condition receives proper attention from the administration.)
Full payment will be given to those who work by the hour.
As we have said before, we refuse to honour our promise to our contractors and employees to pay them according to their working hours.
All employees will be paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal working conditions.
This includes when you are ill and unable to work because of it.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress caused by the world around us.
The work we do, especially in times like these, can have unexpected results.
Again, this is about your own safety.
Our request is that you contact your manager so that we can know what to expect and then adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising groups (among others) perform critical tasks that require additional support.
We will start a process with all sectors to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential for our work.
We all have a lot of work to do and we will all focus on the most essential projects at the moment.
Delaying now will have less impact later.
"We do not plan to work as ""double time to catch up"" once the pandemic period is over".
There is no expectation of working overtime to meet the unrealistic deadline.
We accept that the environment has changed and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What is an APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to new practices and daily working hours expectations, we have proposed to reset the deadline for implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
Our aim is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 Schedule, which will give more time for the next few weeks for employees to plan prioritizing critical work, self-care and care for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or prefer a reduced schedule.
This extension of the deadline significantly reduces the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organisation.
We will present our plan to the Executive Committee next week and update the delegates and teams on next steps once we have the confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead.
Office situation, opportunity for illness and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco was exposed to the COVID-19 pathogen.
However, as a precautionary measure, we cleaned all surfaces in the San Francisco office with an antimicrobial cleaning team to disinfect them.
They used a hospital-grade pathogen-prevention compound to disinfect surfaces, the front room and the electrolytes that accessed our site.
The building maintains a code of ethical or legal obligation to use products that ensure the safety of its residents.
We are relieved to know that the office will be ready for us when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located on a weWork and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC staff.
As of last week, our DC office has fully switched to remote system in line with the shared guidance with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we are also discussing the possibility of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know this is a fix, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hour increments at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how they can be broken down into sessions of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, develop an action plan, and send in advance the items to be studied.
Use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make the live link and link easier.
One to organize meetings in advance, one to monitor questions that arise during the chat and one to track the list of speakers and one to help take notes (or collective note-taking).
If you need a convenient headset, email technical support.
Use the allowance you have been given to buy snacks.
Join the #RemoteTips channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed jobs
The HR Working Group is taking steps to provide webinar based workflow guidance to support the increased level of shared work across the organisation.
Last week, we asked all community funders to cancel public events such as the Wikimedia-funded editathons until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the pandemic over.
We informed them that we understood that they were unable to complete the grant measures they had agreed to based on our request for cancellation and other restrictions and that no penalty would be imposed on anyone for any delay or change in the achievement of those targets.
This week we will follow more guidelines on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
For the global community, instead of helping with clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and others, it is becoming clear that this disorder has generally created tragedy.
CRT is working on setting up a page on Meta-Wiki for the community to help them track the impact and follow our communications, keeping in mind the future.
Keeping up with COVID-19 issues
On next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, we will send out an invitation to your calendars to attend a special staff meeting.
You can use this time to share more updates, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We are ready to help you in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can get some information from this email and all essential COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages periodically to ensure all information is available in one place.
We are also maintaining regular communication with staff in countries with significant levels of infection.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major job category or insurance related challenge or need assistance, please do not hesitate to inform CRT or work with them.
We are here to provide the necessary support and cooperation.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email Brian Judon, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our mission and responsibility.
Rather, they are a recognition that we are at a time when we need to change our work and our commitments in ways that have never been done before.
We consider these steps necessary to support each other to continue our work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to provide the service that the world is looking for.
The tasks we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and get to the important work that's coming in a few weeks or possibly months.

P'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2-ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE-2 counters the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising target drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE-2 acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc metallic enzyme located on the inner membrane and other cell surfaces.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 site and the C-terminal collectorin renal amino acid transport site.
ACE2 is the first membrane protein to cross a boundary, where its enzyme-activated region is expressed on the surface of cells in the lung and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane domain by another enzyme called sheathase, which results in the soluble protein being mixed into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is present in most organs: Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, endorocytes of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the artery and vein, and smooth muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
ACE2 messenger mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, spinal cord and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasconstrict angiotensin II, which is a hormone that is produced by the liver.
ACE2 cleaved the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzed it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), also known as H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
ACE2 may also cause cleavage between [des-ARG9]-pradiquinine, epinephrine, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin, among many other peptides.
ACE2 also regulates the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6.A19, which is responsible for the distribution of proteins and large molecules in cells. This has been confirmed in a rare form of amino acid-dependent demyelinating disease called cardiac arrest.
As a membrane protein, it serves as a major entry pathway for cells for some coronaviruses, including ACE2, human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), SARS-CoV-SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19.
More specifically, the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells, inducing endocytosis and displacement of both the pathogen and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry step requires the subduction of the S protein by the donor's serum protein degradant DMPRSS2, which is currently being studied to see if suppression can be therapeutically effective. This has led to the hypothesis that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with standard ACE inhibitor and ARP therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significantly 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls""".
"In addition, ""treatment with ACE inhibitors has also reduced the risk of pneumonia among patients at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with a history of stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors reduces pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia""
Reflux human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for severe lung injury and appeared to improve pulmonary hematuria and bioavailability in piglets with severe fatty acid-induced respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the time to onset of activity is 30 minutes, with an additional 24 hours (time span) of benefit.
Several findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in circulating angiotensin II-enhanced diseases. Injection of RHACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory syndrome.
"P'COVID-19 Apps are a mobile phone software application designed to help identify contacts during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected individual".
A number of apps have been developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks for developing contact tracing applications have been improved.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alibaba, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 cases.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceDogether is used.
"The app was developed by the local IT community and will be released for free and handed over to the government. The Bluetooth-based app ""Stop Corona!"" was launched by Western Macedonia, which detects the exposure of infected persons and provides quick information to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be released within a few weeks, and that a similar app was planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TrustGather app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to keep infected people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of defence engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems in application-based systems, including false positives and the fact that taking up an application would be less effective if it was limited to a small fraction of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only ""official"" or reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the implications of engaging in mass surveillance using the Coronavirus App, in particular, questioning whether the surveillance infrastructure, which was created to combat the coronavirus pandemic, would be removed once the threat of disease was brought under control.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The companies announced eight conditions for government schemes:
The monitoring shall be legal, necessary and proportionate;
Monitoring and extension of monitoring shall have sunset rules;
The use of data should be for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data protection and anonymity must be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent the increase in discrimination and exclusion;
Sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
Citizens should have the right to defend themselves against and to respond to the interference;
"Meaningful participation of all ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health professionals and marginalized groups will be required. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter One Grensen) (RSF) also published checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple plan seeks to solve the problem of continuous tracking by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems if the tracking mechanism is no longer required.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to bypass tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance was authorized.
Network-based solutions that can access raw location data have significant potential for privacy concerns.
However, not all organizations with central servers need access to private location information; many privacy-protecting organizations have been created that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to identify people who may have been in contact with the infected person.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combines this information and sends it to vulnerable people via text messages.
The information is used to alert potential contacts, and the government has also made location information available to the public, thanks to the massive changes in privacy laws in the country since MERS began to spread.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considered to use both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6th April 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracing is a well-established concept that has been in the research literature since around 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as sending user proximity statuses to other handsets using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has centralized and decentralized approaches, not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include protocols for detecting potential connections in decentralized privacy-protecting proximity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (DCN, FKA contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact detection algorithms (PACD), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches take place on the device itself.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafeBots, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path interference information to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the white paper ""Research: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic published in March 2020 by App Con Rock"". Another similar initiative is the Safe Safe Trace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, a lab originally founded by MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the Global DCN-Alliance, a group of united teams with a common approach and often overlapping protocols, was established with the aim of slowing down the slowdown and enabling a global platform for detecting and alerting applications, a key element in achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government unveiled its official government application, the BlueTree protocol.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the operators of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an effort to identify a contact based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-protecting cryptography, which they said would be done in a way that protects privacy.
They also released specifications of key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be released in three phases:
Official Secret: Tools developed to help governments develop an app to detect potential contacts to protect against the coronavirus.
Google plans to integrate this functionality directly with iOS, Android and Apple, first by taking the system through operating system updates and distributing them to address persistent monitoring issues, and then removing it in the same way once the threat passes.
B' Drug re-use (also known as drug re-use, re-description, re-work or treatment change) is the re-use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than the one originally developed.
It will be part of scientific research and is currently being used to continuously develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine and lymphatic transfusion to eliminate the disease. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug proteins, each with multiple muscle-fibre binding sites.
Studying these binding sites provides a reasonable framework for developing effective antibodies against the COVID-19 protein.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papane-like proteases, RNA-based RNA polymerases, helicases, S protein and ATP ribophosphate.
Hussain AA, et al. examined several study compounds and then optimized their basic similarity with approved drugs with the highest approval. This is being done to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) drug in his preclinical study for recommendation in a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the combined clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and glucoquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Organization (EUO).
The treatment is not approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorized under the European Union (EUA) to be used only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the "vaccination or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
"There is no other way", the doctors said, "and they are taking this medicine".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine vaccine use.
"Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen said the drug favipravir showed ""clear benefits"".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients were confirmed as free of infection in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients had a period of 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan, half of the 240 patients with pneumonia received favipravir and half received umifenovir.

On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its presence and use the military to supply the drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug.Given the severe infection, the drug may be less effective, with the virus already on the rise.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Calestra) concluded that the combination of the antibiotics lopinavir and ritonavir ""provided no benefit""".
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of University of Colorado researchers is trying to change drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.Criticism is within the scientific community about directing resources to the reuse of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ridonavir in an international cohort trial.
Remdecivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and morbidity and mortality. Gilead Sciences later found that remdecivir has objective anti-pathogenic activity against several phyllo-, nemo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
The development of resistance through complex mutations in immunotherapy can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir may have a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for moderate disease and one for severe disease.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C, which is administered intravenously to hospitalized people seriously ill with COVID-19, are underway; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.

A phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is being conducted on 200 patients selected from hospitalised patients with severe impairment in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, included 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and were not admitted to hospital with mild symptoms.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not have an effective contraceptive method are ineligible.
Many blood clot-busting drugs are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian Medicines Agency has issued guidelines on its use.
A multi-patient study of 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April, which examined the use of anoxafarin sodium at doses required for prevention and treatment.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen, much scientific attention has been focused on the re-development of approved anti-pathogenic drugs developed for previously unexpected diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: According to the 7th Chinese study, Ribavirin was prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19.
Umifenovir: According to the 7th China Review, umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Some of the antibiotics identified as being reusable for COVID-19 treatment include:
Docilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Trials also in Italy and China. and Docilizumab#COVID-19.
Beta A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was not expected to be available for 18 months.
In April, five vaccines were selected for the first phase of safety trials.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A severe measles outbreak occurred worldwide in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are using already released genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI noted that speed, manufacturing capacity, large scale implementation and universal access are essential in vaccine discovery initiatives.
In April, CEPI scientists said that 10 different technological research sites and progress were underway in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main basic objectives of the Phase I safety studies are:
In vitro (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 developers and vaccine study: Moderna, messenger erythropoietic in vitro (mRNA-1273))
Microbial carrier (stage I developer and vaccine: Cancino Biologics, adenocarcinoma type 5 carrier)
As announced by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 active projects have been confirmed (79 according to Milken Institute data), and 37 have made announcements, but little public information is available (thought to be in planning or design).
Phase I-II trial is a generally randomized, non-prescription drug-controlled and multi-site, early safety and immunoassay that determines the most accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including a control group, and include testing the effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent disease, while also monitoring adverse effects from the optimal dose of the drug.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human evaluation studies (still in ""preclinical"" research)".
In Australia, on 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clump vaccine that would genetically modify pathogenic proteins to stimulate an immune response.

In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Product Innovation (CEPI), a coalition of COVID-19 vaccine research consortia including Pasteur University, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, announced an investment of US$4.9 million.
Moderna, CureVac, Inovayo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, University of Queensland are the other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal trials of six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccines were developed within 14 days of receiving the communication from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine discovery initiatives at Canadian institutions and universities, including Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At roughly the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which it plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" that will include several new vaccines that can be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported that they had tested a potential COVID-19 vaccine called Bitcovac in mice and stated that ""the RNA-induced SARS-CoV-2 S1 adjunct vaccine exhibits antibody effects [in mice] that are resistant to a potent specific immunoassay and begin to become apparent 2 weeks after immunization"."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy announced that it was developing a DNA-based vaccine nasal spray.
Using microorganisms, this DNA is engineered to create harmless pathogen-like particles within human bacteria that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in collaboration with Amazon, Microsoft and Google on cloud computing, mobilized resources from the US government, industry and three universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can reap benefits beyond the disease they can prevent.
Further randomized trials in Australia are seeking to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development are likely to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using coronavirus COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-mutant mice, other laboratory animals and non-human animals suggests the need for biosecurity level 3 control measures and international coordination to ensure standardized safety practices for handling direct pathogens.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
While MERS was widely practiced, it is believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more are underway, all of which are pathogen-pathogenic vaccines, two adenobacterial-pathogenic (ChAdOx1-MERS, PVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-pathogenic (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories that the pathogen behind COVID-19 has been identified and a vaccine for it already exists.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other strains of the coronavirus, such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
It usually takes five days from the onset of the first symptoms but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most infections cause mild symptoms, there is some progress in pathogenic pneumonia and multiple sclerosis.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of the disease have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly transmitted through close human contact, usually through small droplets in cough, sneeze, or speech.
These warts are formed when the breath is expelled, and they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than being contagious over long distances.
Human infection can be transmitted by contact with eyes, nose or mouth after contact with an infected surface.
The pathogen can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear and during the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China were initially limited to asthma and pneumonia.
In some patients, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the onset period (the time interval during which symptoms appear).
The incubation period of COVID-19 (the period of onset of symptoms), is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all those infected will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully understood; preliminary evidence suggests that they may also contribute to disease transmission.
The proportion of people who are asymptomatic despite being infected is currently unknown and is under investigation, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed patients were asymptomatic when admitted to hospital.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily infection count on 1 April; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mosquitoes and saliva carry high levels of viruses.
Talking out loud is more likely to result in bankruptcies than speaking normally.
Studies have shown that when the mouth is left open, droplets of skin can travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually learned to spread, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bio-aerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hall outside public rooms have yielded positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can spray the bronchial glands, which can spread the toxin through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, says that one person typically infects two to three people, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours to several days.
In particular, pathogen survival was found to be up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on resin (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this will vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Even soap and detergent can be effective if used correctly; soap products break down the fat protective layer of the pathogen and inactivate it, as well as freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission to hospital.
For five of the six patients, the first sample showed more virus, and the sixth patient showed more virus on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory cluster disease in Wuhan.
All the features of natural coronaviruses are also present in the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which causes its defense bubble to burst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The organs most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus accesses host cells via an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The pathogen uses a unique exocrine glycoprotein called a peplomer to communicate with ACE2 and enter another cell.
In Wuhan, China, severe heart failure was diagnosed in 12% of hospitalized patients, and is frequently seen in severe cases.
There are higher rates of cardiac symptoms due to organ-mediated anti-inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but severe cardiac failure may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A higher incidence of venous thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombophobia (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a poor prognosis.Autopsies of those who died due to COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD-DAD), and inflammatory infiltrations with lymphocytes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an induction affinity for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of organ-specific hyperinflammation.
In particular, T-cell secretory pathogen GM-CSF has been shown to be associated with the development of single-cell secretory IL-6 inflammation and acute pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy has reported infiltration of lymph cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several test guidelines for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Usually the test is performed on breath samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a colic swab may also be used.
Usually results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have only a small amount of immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a variant of the coronavirus and released its genetic sequence, so laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to diagnose the infection caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect existing infections and determine whether a person has had infection in the past) were in progress but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experimental experience shows that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhangnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommended methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polymorphism with outward, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is common in early infection.
There may be pleural dominance, transverse respiratory syndrome (thickening of the interosseous membrane with varying cavity fillers), and strengthening during disease progression.
There is some information available about microulcers and the pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Physical examination: pneumonia, heart attack, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary inflammation, lymphocytic hyperplasia, large variation of lymphocytes, secondary inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multi-nuclear giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Transmissible alveolar leakage with transmissible alveolar damage (DAT).
TAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoglycemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: system of leaks in alveolar cavities and pulmonary intermediate fibrosis
Blood: widespread blood clotting (DIC); white blood cell surge reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, observing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Maintaining proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
To control transmission by asymptomatic individuals, the CDC recommends the use of cloth masks in public places.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include that people should keep at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No drug is effective in preventing COVID-19. The key to managing COVID-19 is to slow the peak of the pandemic, which is known as "curve-flattening", as a vaccine cannot be expected until 2021 although as soon as possible.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating, and after rubbing one's nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial seeds in alcohol; it is ""not an active ingredient for hand antiseptics""".
Added by glaciers as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, resuscitation, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECMO), has been used to address the problem of respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Complementary therapies are effective for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the infection.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
The U.S. Urology and Pulmonology community has compiled treatment recommendations from a variety of organizations on the free resource IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the pathogen, especially during procedures where health systems may release droplets, such as tubing or using a hand-operated ventilator.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that a person be kept in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended Equipment: PPE, respirator or mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Respirators (instead of a mask) are recommended if available.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological agent for an unauthorized use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of masks or, lastly, home-made masks.
Most COVID-19 patients do not have a severe enough condition to require artificial respiration or replacements, but a small percentage do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory disorder is being actively studied with some evidence that inhalation with a high-flow nasal cannula or two-stage positive airway pressure may be avoided for those in hospital.
It is not known whether the two have the same benefit in those with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer perforated mechanical ventilation when available, as this technology limits the spread of particulate matter compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Acute infection is most commonly seen in older people (over 60 years of age, and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds for individuals, which limits the ability of health systems to handle the sudden rise in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of people were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized end up in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as severe respiratory tract syndrome (ARTS) develops in COVID-19 and oxidation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure management systems and high PEEP-efficient respirators are required to reduce the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pneumothorax and increase oxygen supply.
The old ventilators may not have high PEEP.
The study of potential treatments began in January 2020, and various antimicrobials are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be very promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antibiotics may be tried in severe cases.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted provisional approval for the use of disinfected feces as experimental therapy in cases where a person's life is critically or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical trials to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect close contact with surveillance data and thus detect the possibility of infection.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation if a potential risk is detected, but also alerts local health authorities. Cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone location tracking and artificial intelligence help to identify infected people and who they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of individuals suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared aggregated phone location data with Robert Koch, a German federal government agency dedicated to researching and preventing the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said he was told by mobile phone service providers that ""40% of people are constantly on the go""".
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Galijulaiðū has called for a global solution to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience pain from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
BBC's Rory O'Connor pointed out that increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are the perfect storm that can harm people's mental and physical health.
The disease may take a moderate course with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Moderate lesions usually resolve within two weeks, while those with already severe or complex disease may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 are limited.In some individuals, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, neurological trauma or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal clotting and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Abnormal clots, particularly increased prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of these patients have abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people arriving with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, of which five days are spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have an average of seven days between admission to hospital and death.
In the early-onset study, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
The study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of autopsy lung samples show tooth damage that can be transmitted with cellular fibromycoid leakage in both lungs.
Pathogenic mutations were found in the pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
According to the National Health Commission of China, heart failure, including heart attack, was observed, with increased levels of troponin and heart attack accounting for 11.8% of deaths.
According to March data from the US, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing medical conditions.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomy of a region can also affect mortality.
Because of those regional differences, but also due to systemic issues, mortality estimates differ from this condition.
Failure to take into account the number of mild cases would make the mortality rate exaggerated.
However, the fact that there are deaths as a result of past outbreaks may indicate an underestimation of the current mortality rate.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require acute treatment or die compared to nonsmokers.Concerns have been raised about the long-term continuation of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that some recovered patients had a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity, and pulmonary x-rays suggested that the organ was damaged.
This can lead to post-acute diagnosis following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether it provides effective and long-lasting immunity to people recovering from past infections.
Immunity is seen to be possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have been reported to have subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus.
These patients are believed to have a worsening of chronic infection rather than recurrent infection.
The pathogen is natural and is thought to have originated from animals through direct infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the disease was almost entirely human-to-human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed the initial date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the World Health Organization (WHO) found early symptoms on 8 December 2019.
There are several methods used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and are influenced by testing volumes, quality of health system, treatment choices, time since initial infection, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes as U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The ratio between death and disease infection reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases detected over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.9% (1,53,822/2,24,0191) as on 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease that will die, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected who will die from a disease (identified and undiagnosed).
These figures are not time-bound and follow a specific group of people who have been immunocompromised.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, the small village of Castiglione di Ada, 4,60,080 (1.7%) people have already died.
In Genkelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths were formally classified.
And the German healthcare system is not very good.
In the Netherlands, an estimate of 3% of people who donate blood may have immunity.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate is different for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that men are more likely to die.
For men, the risk is highest when they're in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only close to 90.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender-differentiation are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immune disparities, lower smoking rates in women, and the development of medical conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age in men may be more likely to cause death in men than in women.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died with COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the US government did not monitor data on sexual transmission of COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
"The official name of the disease is ""COVID-19"" as announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, T stands for Disease, and 19 stands for 31 December 2019, when the outbreak was first identified.
The name is named after the International Recommendation for the Prevention of Naming with the Purpose of Stigmatisation, to avoid referring to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), fauna or group of people. The most severe respiratory syndrome causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2.
"WHO additionally uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications".
Both disease and pathogen are commonly referred to as coronaviruses.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the pathogen and disease were commonly referred to as the coronavirus and the Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the interim names 2019-Enkove and 2019-Enkove severe respiratory disease for this pathogen and disease in accordance with its 2015 Guidelines against the use of place names for disease and pathogens.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in common supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health products such as nasal swabs and respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight after the supplier was unable to deliver in the required amount of time.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans seem to be capable of spreading the pathogen to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of transcription of the pathogen in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a ""cohesion trial"" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four well-functioning antibiotics based on existing efficacy".
There are no vaccines at present, but various companies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
The earlier work of SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccine strategies are being explored.
First, researchers aim to develop a complete pathogen vaccine.
The use of such pathogen, whether it is inactive or dead, is aimed at demonstrating the human body's immune system against novel infections of COVID-19.
The second strategic, sub-phase vaccines, aim to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subgroups of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccines, a modern technology for vaccine manufacturing).
The experimental vaccines derived from any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the pathogen that causes the disease.Immunobased development has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials are evaluating treatments for malaria that have already been approved, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese studies have mostly included alternative-use antibiotics, and results from nine Phase III trials on remdicivir are expected by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was in place as of April 2020. Existing antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ridonavir and ritonavir in combination with lopinavir/interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients receiving unapproved remdecivir therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China with initial results in February 2020.
However, there are calls for a co-authored re-evaluation of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Pathology notes that while the recommended daily dose is one gram, it is twice that amount and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to objectively prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Further nitasoxanide was recommended in the Vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that early pin protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin are subject to a high limit and the medical world would not accept them without further studies.Oceltamyvir does not objectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-resistant storm properties. Docilizumab is included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China based on the results of a small study.
It is undergoing a nationwide Phase 2 non-randomized trial in Italy after showing positive results in severely ill patients.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, it is thought to counteract some of these developments, which are thought to be responsible for the deaths of some victims.
In 2017, the FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor based on studies of retrospective infection for the treatment of a different cause-driven steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome called CART cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilisumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of alternative immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with infinite results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antiprotein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms such as antiprotein-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or baccytosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of manufactured borderline antibodies, are in progress.
The production of fluid from blood taken from recovered patients and pathogenic serum with specific antibodies to this pathogen can be increased for rapid use.
Coronary disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
