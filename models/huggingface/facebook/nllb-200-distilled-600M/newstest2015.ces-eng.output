Peter Čech: The last minute transition?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day you can still jump the transfer window and make a big move.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently Chelsea's substitute goalkeeper, is not currently on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Smyków, talking to Czech journalists and preparing for the Czech national team's qualifying match against the Americans and then the Euro 2016 qualifying match against the Netherlands.
In the new season, Thibaut Courtois is promoted to the Premier League as Chelsea's goalkeeper.
There was speculation a while ago that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atlético at the start of the season and failed to make the league when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He's been out of the French league for the season with two wins and two draws, shooting St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
The most pressing shoe is the AS Monaco.
He's 1-1-2 in the league so far and broke up with Lille a little bit at 1:1 over the weekend.
There were reports on the English tabloids today that the Czech Republic might want to join Queens Park Rangers.
But according to English bookmakers, the Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is unlikely.
Skype put a 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your shirt in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but in football, nothing is ever 100%.
Maybe in the course of the day, an offer you can't refuse.
What would an offer like that look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be turned down actually looks like.
It would have to be a consensus of all parties. It would depend on Chelsea's position, whether or not the club would accept any offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a move now that you're in Prague?
Wouldn't you need to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
I didn't think about it.
But in that situation, there are a lot of players out there, they're all in the squad meetings, and there's definitely a lot of transfers going to be closed today.
So it would be somehow feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing for a departure?
The situation where I missed the first three games of the season is new to me after 15 years of career.
But there's no reason to panic, pack up and go away.
I want to continue to be in the Chelsea goalkeeper's fight and it's up to the coach to decide who to make the decision over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
The sporting aspect is important to me, of course, but I also look at it from a personal perspective, which is of course part of the family's needs.
Is it possible you could catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at a meeting in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since winning the May election to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
The list is primarily concerned with plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the report, India also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Karata police arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it was driving 125 km/h in a maximum speed zone and into a ditch to escape the police.
A traffic police patrol in Karrath tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the border this morning when they noticed it was going 125 km/h from the gas station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the driver didn't stop and continued down Burgess Road and then went into a ditch, so the police lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person who matched the driver's description were then spotted at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karrath police have charged a 20-year-old man with disrespecting a call for a halt and reckless driving.
The trial in Karata will be on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster accused of raping a hotel in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man is to be brought to trial on charges of raping women at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was introduced to the prosecution during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
According to Webster, she was attacked while she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.
Webster is also charged with the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Justice Lady Rae has set the date for her trial at the Edinburgh High Court on 17 November.
A renewal of the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that protects union organizing as a civil right.
"The way unions work, the way jobs work for the middle class", says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who co-chairs the Congressional Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to introduce a law that strengthens the status of employees, along with the occasional rights model John Lewis.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organizing unions as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-union forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination to join unions to stand trial in civil court - and to award compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers are proposing is to re-engage with the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country was one breath, promoting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toya's military autocracy was replaced by democracy.
They believed that workers and their unions were playing a role in shaping a new Japan, they included language in them and they openly recognized that the right of workers to assemble, negotiate and act collectively was guaranteed.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans, aware that workers would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, included a clause that openly states: The right to form associations that would secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Any agreement which restricts or seeks to infringe this right shall be annulled.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a universal treaty, the proponents and Roosevelt's guarantee that everyone has the right to form and join trade unions as part of protecting their interests included it.
Americans have been embracing the basic premise for generations that labor rights are human rights.
When countries advised other countries on how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and advocate in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that elevated America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
A bill signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is set to go into effect on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must in the meantime obtain that permit.
The proposed party will be able to carry on its activities legally and in the meantime obtain a permit, says the decision of Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get a permit.
"Today's ruling ensures women in Louisiana are safe from a deceptive law that is meant to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued three of the five clinics to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics who were not among the applicants and who also applied for such authorisation.
Louisiana is one of 11 states to pass similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such provisions unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge Friday.
Women's rights activists, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a permit places medical requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion have opposed the measures by saying that they aim to protect women's health, and some have also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed down because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that only one abortion doctor is licensed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities in response said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while they wait for the rights application to be processed.
Because of late diagnosis and poor treatment availability, ovarian cancer is killing more people in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent lived five years after their diagnosis.
Susan Jordan, the study's lead author at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
A small study: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rates were found in older women who had been diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"Gynaecologists who usually live in larger cities are the best at treating the disease", she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help by strengthening transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people who are being treated far from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother, Elisha Neave, from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the decline in homeownership
According to a study by HTA published by the Financial Times, the decline in the extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that by the time today's younger generation of consumers reach the age group of gardeners, garden centres will lose up to 10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend on their gardens, on average, 55 percent of the amount spent by people living in their own homes.
Other threats to the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, include the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of flooring instead of the precincts used as parking space and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on garden products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that rental housing or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "The tenants are very fond of growing plants in flowerbeds - when they move, they can take the plants with them.
The HTA report revealed that the golden age of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher rainfall this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the dictator of the East preaches democracy.
After Putin robbed the youth organization, which reminds me of Hitler Youth, of nuclear weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can control both the suppressed nationalism and the complex of inferiority, and they can transform it into imperialist tastes.
Time seems to be different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought the era of wars over dominance over Europe was long gone, the Eastern world thought they had been neglected for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930's, just before the Nazi takeover, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the whole cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that's pretty much the same thing.
Vladimir Putin and most Russians probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half trembled before them.
Maybe Western politicians were to blame, maybe a few of them were shoulder-to-shoulder with Vladimir, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, maybe they underestimated him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He cleaned up his house, pretended he didn't want to go anywhere, and he was stabbing his house.
Now he's decided to take back the position he lost.
It's going to start slowly. It's time.
He's a leader for life, so what's the hurry?
He's trampled the Caucasians, now he's trampled the Ukrainians, then the dwarves from the Baltics.
You've been spitting Russian bears in your skin for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, which is kind of jumping too high and is definitely making a long-distance trip.
And the Germans of Vladimir are pretty pissed off about how well they're doing, too, and we put them up their asses at 45.
How about we make a new Novosibirsk in Charles Vare.
It's a base, and there's a lot of us there, and they're crushing them up there, and they're trying to take out every one of them.
Our veterans still remember what they were like in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister, Mr. Sabotka, he's so soft, he can be robbed like an onion and eat their whole EU.
That would make them jump on the big Russia.
We need to remind them where their place is.
And as explosives, we'll use our personal computers that live on their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when you say they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we're not gonna leave them alone, we're gonna protect them.
And then again, the Russian will rule, for what he was born to do.
Europe is only as good as a cover for proud Ivan to dance the Cossacks.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the country's highest-ranking US diplomat to explain a report on US and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish officials were in talks on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst suggested that Turkey was a priority target for US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states were monitoring each other.
An earlier report, which also claimed that the German intelligence service targeted Ankara, provoked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones has introduced another trick of the fourth series
Game of Thrones creators are currently filming episodes of the fifth season of the cult series.
They also boasted about the fourth-rate tricks.
Most visible are computer-generated adaptations of the series setting and mass scenes where the sound of soldiers turns into a giant army of famous Daenerys.
Magalfu police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police and civil servants of the municipality of Calvia to the Office of the Prosecutor of the State of Mallorca.
The police chief of Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, was arrested after allegations were made by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Magaluf party district.
Inspector General José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magalufu's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the Internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police and civil servants to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Office in the municipality of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for alleged corruption and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying that the public sector's incentives have a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival", one of the businessmen told the court.
Don't play games with our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after an 18-year-old British tourist gave oral sex to 24 men on a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep tabs on the drunk and rioters at the crowds of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious bar tours of alcohol.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex incident took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the Carnage club's tour organizers, to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-related accidents, including a fashion wave known as balconing in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
First day of spring marked by rain and storms that affected flight at Adelaide Airport
THE spring of South Australia brought an ice storm, heavy rain, and strong winds that hit Adelaide's airport.
Another 5 mm of rainfall is expected in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with several short overflows associated with the storm and the wind gusts that began before 8 p.m. and brought almost 4 mm of rain in about ten minutes.
After several early spring doses came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8 degrees Celsius on Monday.
The storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delay of Virgin Airlines' flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m. but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at the time reached ground speeds of about 50 km/h.
Flight data showed that the plane had to take off from the second landing and finally arrived at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight subsequently caused further delays including Emirates' flight from Dubai and Qantas' flight from Sydney.
The weather forecast for Adelaide is that it will reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two extremes may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summers in anti-bomb shelters, while their homes were hit by rockets and mortars during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of a school that was hit by a rocket removed the debris from the wall and are slowly waiting for the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Saad kibu and a local English teacher.
Many children in this area really need to get back to their routines.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that it's a little strange to go back to school all at once.
"We had a few rough times and we never left the house", she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, has been visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian minefield shot and killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still had not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study hard, adding: "We will provide you with education and security".
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite peace.
The ceasefire, while leading to an immediate cessation of hostilities, did not address key issues such as Hamas' demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians have died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radical groups from Gaza have fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities, mainly in the south.
The Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and an estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools that were turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
'I hope they open the school soon so that we can finish our education like Jewish children and other children in the world,' said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm standing behind you.
And the laffat is hot
The Czech national football team met in Prague today before the Wednesday qualifying match against the USA and the opening match of the European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 crew, the Spartan attacker David Lafat is in trouble, suffering from heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's probably still having some of those problems.
But we want him here and he's okay as soon as possible", said Pavel Vrba.
"Whether it will be two or three days, or tomorrow, he will be fit, will depend on his health condition, as our doctor decides", he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has a little pain, but it's not like they can't train or go to the match on Wednesday against the USA", the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called Spartan defender Lucas Vaz as the last player.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, as other midpoles thought.
I decided based on the fact that Lucas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it", said Vrba to Vách.
What the fuck?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that in case of health problems the nomination may be changed.
For example, the weekend was a great one for the Liberian Josef Shural, who scored a hat trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafat does.
In case he is not available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot nominate any of the players who have taken part in the Czech league", Vrba said.
The team's training is scheduled for this afternoon in Strahov, followed by a classic pre-season training on Tuesday before the USA Summer Duel, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph ceremony.
The fight against the Americans is on Wednesday from 8:15 p.m. and the national team will be striving for a premiership victory at Wraca.
In the previous three pre-season matches, he has played two draws and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9th at 8:45pm.
Walking on foot to the Netherlands to Italy
The wrestler is happy to have more time to train than the previous ones.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them on things we might not have had that much time to do before.
Now we can only focus on preparing ourselves as best we can for the Netherlands", said Vrba.
The Dutch will perform in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the match will be personally watched by former interim coach Josef Pesic.
He'll give us the information they're from the match.
But it's not just about him, we'll have a game on tape and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there are going to be", Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to highly tracked statistics, winter home prices have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the Australian Capital Territory's Data CoreLogic Index, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase of 4,2% in June, July and August, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase increased to 10,9%, more than doubling in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data's research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne were the market leaders.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose 11.7%.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising by an average of five to six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was hit by the state-mandated spending cuts and where prices rose only by 1,4%.
Lawless said that as spring now begins, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a real test for the market.
Given the persistently high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase further over the next three months,he said.
My father never took me.
He never told me I love you
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through a series of therapy sessions and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: "Stop making that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were adults -- went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer bottle or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I've never spoken to him like that.
For most of my life, he's been a serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Henry recently visited the Dudley distillery, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he gained a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and smoke.
Dad always went into the bathroom and just lay there, and then you could hear him slowly start singing for himself because he was washing the dishwasher off.
As I passed, I realized that he had been working for years to feed his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
No one took my dad away, no one said I love you.
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying I like you?
Don't hold me like that!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She 's a great mom .
He and French, to whom he's been married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and I was starting to show symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change".
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat a carrot alone.
The change in direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
Then came the Comedy of Errors and the Auguste Wilson Fence.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television".
He learned to walk.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn to make fun jokes, to be a star, and to be on television between 1975 and 1985, and that was really hard.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, a comedy show in which actors dressed in black, Henry ended up performing his comedy for five years.
My family was already a mess.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stage and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was for years the most acclaimed British television product, but also a grotesque parody of blacks.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, introducing characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known for his role as Chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!.
He's taken decades off from commercials, documentaries, TV shows and movies, but after his LennyHenry.tv show aired on the BBC in 2008, he thought, "So what are you gonna do now, Len, because it's kind of like you're stuck somewhere or you're getting a little out of the way?"
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him well in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try this".
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had 20 lines of Othell's closing speech for the document and he was already doing it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for a break, which didn't happen.
He soon started acting in a comedy full of mistakes.
I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed".
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for capturing the audience.
A voice in my head said, "Before they fix the computer, you have to talk to them for ten minutes now".
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me was saying, "Hmm, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
You play, stay in the role.
Henry in the Plotech at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the plot was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a god sign saying, "You should do this".
Of course, he says it in a normal voice.
So I'm staying on it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the test room.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain -- interrupting our conversation with humorous performances all the time, when he enters and outs the role of a performer.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you could end up in a dead end.
Sometimes I do Live at the Apollo when I want to, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked if he'd ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director helping outline the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think you did.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love the stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to look for non-existent employees
Kenya has started biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who fail to register for the next two weeks will no longer be paid.
The government believes that thousands of people are getting paid even after they leave public service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
This year's audit showed that the state is losing at least one million dollars (£700,000) a month in salaries of non-existent employees and other abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after an employee dies or after an employee leaves government, said Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear within the next two weeks at the identification centres where their data will be recorded biometrically, the government statement said.
He also says that anyone who does not arrive without an apology will be removed from the payroll.
By identifying actual public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its economy and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of nonexistent employees said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for plotting against the government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of conspiracy against the government.
The police department has not commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of an action by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jaceynuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he is determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools have a traditional September 1 ceremony.
Not all Ukraine is at peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that the children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing sewn shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rhona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found a boss for a tough time.
He carries a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circle of the Conservative Party.
She's got some frontline experience.
She began her career at Bain and Co. and then moved on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons in the media world.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when her younger colleague took over the top position at Pearson's parent company.
They say her pension was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former BP director, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became a government consultant.
Her husband is a former city councilman.
In May, I described the director's job as poisoned cups.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the center of public life, but there is also an inner paradox within its structure.
The corporation is moving in two directions: inside the top tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also out to the public at times of turmoil when things don't work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
But who would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and losing his job?
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would love to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
As the competition circle expands and new technology challenges old assurances, immediate negotiations on concession fees are a major danger for the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is certainly the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96 percent of households, and it costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, BBC fanbase is clearly on the rise: 53% of fans, up from 31% ten years ago.
The BBC's usage patterns have changed: Today, I get headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the offensive tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was posted on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another tweet was posted to Perry's account that distanced itself from the previous one.
There was a tweet that went off my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I have removed it", he wrote in a post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to the questionnaire reports immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for its administration.
A previous tweet posted a rude, humorous picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry declined to pay the funds for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The description in the tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times the blood alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for holding me responsible".
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The investigation into Perry was not led by the Lehmberg office.
It was headed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to drop the charges because using the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended a $7.5 million payment from the state's public interest defense department, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint by a left-wing civil rights group.
Perry's official account is active, and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might already be finishing by tweeting a photo of himself running by the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal.
One of London's leading developer companies warned that the housing market in south-east England had returned to normal.
Housing in the capital was in high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble led the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley challenging client development company, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013. He adds that this provides a stable environment for operation.
London's housing market was doing well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded the capital.
According to the Census Bureau, prices in the city rose by 18.5% last year alone, far exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound has made London's real estate market less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and the talk of a possible 'residential tax' that politicians came up with ahead of the parliamentary elections next May.
London real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market review, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has reduced its prediction of London property prices to 3% in 2015 as home prices have already begun to fall.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has declined by a quarter each year, according to real estate firm WA Ellis.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital city was a boon to Berkeley, as it raised the cash for the forward sale to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and forward sales have been maintained.
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, revenue by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of the annual meeting of Pidgley, he said that Berkeley's annual revenues are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley stood at £23.96 this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a list of hundreds of other star-studded actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and criticized the hacker for "apparent privacy violations".
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly acquired the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, through a crack in Apple's iCloud Internet storage system.
It's unclear how many photos are authentic, but film star Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world Winstead also tweeted criticism of the act.
"I hope those of you who view photos of me and my husband years ago in a private home are happy with themselves", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for her appearances on Nickelodeon's cable TV series iCarly and Victorious, denied the photos were real, but tweeted: "These alleged nude photos of me are a P.O.V.R.H., people.
Better to stick it in the mud.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that pop star Ariana Grande's spokesman denied the alleged photos were true.
An extraordinary example of Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter J
They broke up, that's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrating like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, some woman told him he was too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and maybe a little impulsive.
And then she shake his hand.
He admitted it later.
He could fuck like a heron, yeah.
The final victim of his ability was a love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of the boredom of his lonely life and perhaps even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild warm hair and a flying heart from a village on the north island that was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben.
To the south came an older society, which Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, aptly, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, the vans were dead spiders, the snails were signing their hands on the windows as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was full of grass, and the weed looked like huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a little boy's story hut, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel J is on the shortlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The narrow selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in a long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, in their absence setting up a public station that provided the area with comforting music and reassuring messages, when the sight of her brown crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian whose roles his father loved to hear.
You got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they stopped playing songs like that on the radio.
They weren't banned -- there was nothing actually banned -- they just didn't play.
They helped them get to desuetudo, as did the word itself.
Folk taste has done what regulations and outlaw status can never do, and just as people in books choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, the cook and the romance novel, so in music, ballads are chosen.
Cavern let himself be pulled down by the day and began to play the imaginary piano and sing a serena to Aileen's big feet in a rough, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller", he said, and he automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to squeeze the letter "j" out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word starting with a "J", it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.
He just knew it was what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn's never heard of any.
Even jazz, even if it wasn't directly outlawed, didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one place in life once.
When she started playing the melodies, people wanted to know where she would end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got people nervous.
And jazz was a humorous expression of song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Jr. until he was 10, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-classical collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to tell me that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when the most popular singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure.
A free society is one in which each part of it, gratefully - gratefully to those who were fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were good for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if they were born with a gift for electronics, took responsibility for ensuring that no family would be without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were dishwashers.
Those in the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly while THAT WAS happening, if it was happening - fearing being accused of being set on fire, actually fearing that the fire would consume them the next time - opened restaurants selling labneh and smoking water fumes, ignoring themselves and being inactive slowly eating them.
Each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how music could be made out of the stupid words Kavern was singing to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really stupid", Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
There was no word that could escape from the sound sheet.
Ailinn was still not understanding.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put his two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny", he said at last.
She unfaithfully shook her head and obscured Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing was seen but the curls of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
If you think so, she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Am I too big for my legs?
He looked again.
Not the feet.
Maybe a little ankle...
You're saying you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her I love you, but it was too soon.
I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now.
I'm a little prone to it.
It didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to curb the cruelty that was lurking in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of bed, put down the radio and spilled some uneducated wine.
It's a wine without a syringe, so it wasn't worth the drinking.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
I'm just so attracted to you being a jerk, she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her abusive words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up to him.
She thought she was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide, icy ocean was shaking for them.
The same crazy men, then, what happened, even more unconcerned and angry than their ancestors, smugglers and cashiers, raged from pub to pub, ready to shake hands with any woman who dared refuse or laugh at them.
What the fuck?
If she's not careful, they'll give her their fists!
First, anointing her - anointing became the most common expression of erotic arousal between a man and a woman: the counterpart to the faint ballads about love that the radio was chanting - first, anointing her, then killing her.
In Kevern's view, over-cultivation, because petting was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons has been implying to him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt frozen, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from a window on the second floor - a man who had been caught up in what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was heavy for him and for all the men in general, no matter how few of them killed her.
The man turned away, shoulders bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
Some 20 years after the events, Esme Nussbaum, a brilliant and enthusiastic 23-year-old researcher at Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, wrote a short article about the persistence of light and medium-severe violence in areas of the country where it is most expected to be mitigated or stopped if enough money and energy is put into its elimination.
"Much has been done and much still needs to be done", she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of the people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the secluded, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tops of the church towers that rise above the living fences, the breath of human kindness has historically rarely been seen".
But some things are irreplaceable.
It may seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents are eager to hear sentimental ballads, swallow up unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality persist in rural areas as harshly as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance is emerging at home, at work, on the road, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too floral", her superior said.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer that", Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again backed up her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask why", Rabinowitz finally said, "I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudice in this workplace.
We serve a society that is not connected.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity that is itself perfectly acceptable and commendable can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown.
You're obviously predisposed to the church yourself - things you call cruel and brutal that others might interpret as expressions of natural power and energy.
Continuing to deal with what happened, if it happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, preparing the earth with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
His head was flashing pink on the light board with the recommendations Ofnow had sent out to the world for the last quarter century or so.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, a word sung is better than a written one, but there is nothing better than love.
"I understand your objections", answered Esme Nussbaum quietly, knowing that her superior was dead, "and I can no longer say that the wound did not heal as we believe it did.
My concern is that unless we are warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAS happened, if it has happened.
But this time, we're not going to vent our anger and distrust on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the tips of his fingers.
That was supposed to be endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "when you describe the steps your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You're going too far in talking about how they vented their anger and distrust into others.
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present we're not talking about ourselves and others.
There were no "we" and there were no "oni".
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
During which, if we're honest with each other, Esma has taken courage, none of us are innocent.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing more to say - we're all in this together.
And just as there is no guilt that can be blamed on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what's the use of the past for other than to learn from it?
The past exists to forget it.
If I can add anything to that...
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected the tips of his fingers.
"I will take your report into account", he said and released her.
The day she was on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle rider who hit her on the sidewalk in a way that passersby described as "brutal and furious".
Accidents happen, you know.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup is planned - the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied that they have staged a coup to overthrow the government, and claim that they have been acting against the police on suspicion of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country, saying the army has surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
After declaring death threats, the prime minister and his family fled to neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that the coup was not a coup, but the army's response to the threat of political fanatics that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the Kingdom of Lesotho's defence command acted after receiving several reports from the intelligence services that there were several groups in the police ranks planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were about to launch a crackdown in the country", "The Voice of America" said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be a coup d'état", he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to internal disputes, tensions have reigned in Lesotho.
He said that despite the contrary, he did not undermine the government's actions.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to a 13-month low, according to a closely monitored survey in August.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 represents expansion.
The loss of new orders and factories has damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will demand a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to the one the UK and US joined during the financial crisis.
"While at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of growing economies and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is increasingly visible", said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy in the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is a concern about France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force behind growth in key industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring, said Dobson.
The industry slowdown is likely to fuel analysts looking to implement further monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57,3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production overview of purchasing managers for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.
He added: "The current situation of euro area producers is very complex, as the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This growing trade uncertainty has evidently affected - and in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially those of high value.
He said that it was more likely that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, although we expect it to be limited.
Ten years of hell for the Beslan survivors: Ten years after the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were taken hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children
We returned to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific Beslan school invasion, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night, survivors of the warnings warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists kidnapped and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united East and West, leading to negotiations and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What's their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov, wearing only her underwear, trying to get back into the bombed-out school gym after the bomb exploded inside.
Confused Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't", said Aida at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
I've got some shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people like the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it", she said determinedly.
It just happened to me, and it's not gonna change.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jerry Gapoe, were killed there.
When we were kids, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the capture, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture of myself on the Internet climbing out of a school window, I think to myself that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rains of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and he survived a three-day siege of school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand".
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Flee".
He was afraid she was dead, ran away, and on the way he saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother is dead".
He says, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was on the run and lying in the hospital with a leg wound, thinking her son was dead.
When they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the now-defunct News of the World) where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are fading.
I remember throwing all my guns at the game right after that.
But I can play computer games today that shoot, and I have no problem with that.
I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't come out.
We'll never say they were killed or they died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember well on the trip to London, especially how I could pick anything I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he's suffering from war just as much as he and his friends have.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel sorry for anyone who has to go through such a terrible ordeal", says Damir, who volunteered at the convent last week.
I want to help you so badly.
I want to work for the police one day and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children anywhere that would scream and run, and that silence lasted for months.
He remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said, "I still don't think the world has changed for the better in the last ten years.
There's a war in Ukraine now, people are dying every day, and I think there were and many more children killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a nice, quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about this.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he's very close to six of his classmates and he goes to the gym every now and then and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his guns or other weapons to play with.
I can hardly believe I spent hours convinced he was dead and never to see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up, I looked around and I saw hell, pieces of human bodies lying all over the place.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
I remember yelling, "Damire, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran.
So our lives go on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivor of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was poured into his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the Atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my boy was alone there for three days", she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Gregory survived.
As the date approaches, it's harder and harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments come back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Recurring memories: A picture of Gregory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day when Gregory was so excited about going to school, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Gregory crying in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like to look at that picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that this image makes people all over the world know what pain we're feeling.
Today, Gregory says, "It's important that this never happens again.
I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
They're investigating the crash of a Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
I don't understand why this is happening because if you ask people, nobody wants war, as much as possible?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years of nightmares, but then things got better.
Then, when I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, as September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladivostok.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
The first is the "Gregory Farniyev", 20.
A boy who survived despite being held by a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us like it was yesterday", said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but couldn't because of the injuries he sustained in the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind my head.
Now that I'm older, they say that kids can handle bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
I went to see a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, a year later, that was the first and last time I ever went back to the gym.
I passed out.
I'm never going back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit on that famous picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his picture taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health goes, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But still, because of health reasons, I couldn't get into and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to veterinary school.
I finished my second year there.
They're learning how to treat all animals from kittens to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about it.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "The pain will be here forever.
He's in there and he's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'm going to attend the memorial service.
I know Gregory's not coming.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God for giving it back.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown man now, but he's carrying on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several operations, can walk, but can't exercise.
I'd say I've overcome the horror by about 50%, but you can't overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience with us will always be there.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed in the attack, and the pain only gets worse.
I've lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm hurt by the loss of the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is coming on our country now, which I can hardly believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could just get all these rebels and throw them away, we could go as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A child taken to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyon Tskayev is being taken to safety by Russian Special Forces (left).
She 's ten now (right) and she doesn 't remember the tragedy at all
The world was in a state of shock in 2004 when a Russian policeman carried Alyona out of a prisoner's cell in his arms.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara in captivity at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and they and their new wife Svetlana have a little girl, named Kristina, after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, now 10, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said they're a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.
Ruslan is a great father and he wants to keep his kids away from the memories that his tenth birthday brings.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you're interested in photography or underwater photography, you have a wide range of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact one like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party, a couple of cameras, all of them cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to getting the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly sealed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a stage or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, figure out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only set within 5 feet, others within 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof applications.
Always take a few shots - not many of them will work.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you make photos, but outdoor cameras don't.
Even if you have a LCD, underwater visibility will be poor and the composition of the image unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of images with slightly different exposure scattering, use that.
Stay close to the surface.
With the deeper depth, the light is significantly reduced.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you see.
Get close to the object being photographed.
That's great advice if you're shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you're shooting with an outdoor camera: These devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in an organization as huge as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the sick of pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that paralyzed him.
Lawson realized that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the vast majority of treated patients are interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel my skin", he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was experiencing flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet was being blamed.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later".
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague did a chest X-ray.
He skied in the French Alps two weeks before.
X-ray results are back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the colon or the lung lining.
In most cancers, it's hard to tell what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is due to exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was once called miraculous but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even at the time of asbestos use, only certain groups of people, such as insulators, builders, carpenters, and shipbuilders, came into close contact with it.
Toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that kind of self-righteousness is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the UK is currently at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
The death rate from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease each year are twice the number of car crash victims.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we're only feeling its effects now, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all forms of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The mesothelioma epidemic is not just for construction veterans.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
So the mesothelioma has no respect for social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged backyards from London's department stores to public schools are no refuge.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the warehouses of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement halls of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice", he wrote.
- All the students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who practiced at Guy's Hospital and who have had mesothelioma in the last five years, "he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive.
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17th of that year.
Surviving this diagnosis for so long is not uncommon.
Fifty-five percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of their diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us have the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them nowadays have no idea that they're going to die this way.
Asbestos mining in Quebec, Canada
A simple look at court records, where disabilities often come and demand compensation, shows how widespread the mesothelioma disaster has been.
For example, in June, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligent exposure of asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw two clothing department stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship store, Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She has two children now in their 20s.
"Before it happened", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed it would be anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
Asbestos is not actually a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
He got his name because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and tenderness.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is most often found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and WHO consider it a 'high health risk' that can cause death.
But the most dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocodilite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that there is "convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]".
A Marsk & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store on Oxford Street in London .
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that a significant proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.
A significant part of this exposure is due to the regular use and ventilation of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people in the central government may not have any idea that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that said the service lifts and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fiber of which could be broken by something as harmless as a "strong airflow".
Ministers are often accused of being self-interested, but in this case the opposite may be true.
While the Parliamentary Services Directorate insisted on getting the Palace of Westminster a thorough medical certificate, it now expects that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to thoroughly inspect Parliament, modernize electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 election MPs will sit on the green benches rather than the green benches in Westminster in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations.
There's no telling if this disagreement will cost lives.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who never could tell when they had exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital where asbestos was proven", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers a day in early December of 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45, it was the evening, and he was in the middle of the operation.
I was shaken up.
It came out of nowhere.
I was so sick.
I thought I wasn't going home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that pain came from the colon, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, she had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
The confused doctors took an X-ray of his chest and put a chest catheter in to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent to the chest.
They still haven't made a diagnosis.
His condition gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between his chest cavity and his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take too much, he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results came in between Christmas and New Year's Day: "They told me it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with the sisters at the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
Asbestos has been found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to experience disease.
So, mesothelioma is now starting to affect younger people who don't have a high-risk profession.
The most dangerous asbestos heat-insulated pipes in hospitals were found in the basement, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who passed through the basement hallways (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were quite certain to come into contact with the toxin.
As it now turns out, for several decades after the war, hospitals were places where patients could be saved, but also places where the lives of the doctors who treated them could be endangered.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Bunsen's students were building their kahan on asbestos pads.
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its excellent insulation and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
We've created websites that address asbestos in schools.
Harmless items, such as floor tiles or rooftops, on the tools in our homes typically contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a large number of homes", notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact of asbestos a woman with mesothelioma could remember was during a garden house drilling in the 1970s.
So watch your backyard house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to get over it", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was moving from a doctor to a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all of this", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to make it another Christmas.
That's it.
Mesothelioma is especially destructive because the very mechanism that keeps us alive -- the very breathing -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is a tiny fiber.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can settle into the colon, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the esophagus and can cause cell mutations.
The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers, explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was exposed to asbestos, and which is paradoxically a leading center in mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who may have been exposed to asbestos during their hospital practice.
Asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Treasure says, and the breath itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
It's been invasive in nature from the start.
In mesothelioma, the common treatment options used in other cancers do not take as much.
For example, the effectiveness of surgery is hotly debated.
Some say it's worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the diaphragm", he says.
You're not gonna get a scalpel around her.
Cancer is not very responsive to chemotherapy, which has some effect but does not cure it.
"Sometimes there's someone who survives lung cancer", Treasure says.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After the diagnosis of mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to people with similar disabilities.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself, "Good morning, you called the cancer center".
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, likely extending his life by only a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was about to give up.
Lawson, however, was able to put things in a more optimistic light.
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdusky of the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they searched me", admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a petition and have to approve his payment.
To get the best treatment available, money is key for mesothelioma patients.
But when treatment fails, many patients face another financial challenge - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson has contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
However, in the 1960's, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, Guy's Hospital confirmed that asbestos in the incinerated basement was removed in the 1990s.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Lethal exposure to asbestos at one company or workplace - usually decades after that - has proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed hands or gone bankrupt.
The insurance records are missing.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly don't.
In response to this, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve that is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled receive 80% of the amount normally allocated to them by the court as compensation - approximately £120,000.
Each year, 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks £350m is a good job.
It's a contract signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if the time hadn't come and people with mesothelioma would have been able to reach out to former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had gaps.
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People are suffering too much and need help now", Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunsky recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
Following the operation, radiation and chemotherapy followed - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"It's not the most important thing, of course", says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
He completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy in late August.
The controls showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had a few stains of cancer in my chest.
My 50th birthday was coming up.
It's not life threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott went through six more cycles of chemotherapy.
There are no signs of tumors in his body at this time.
It's a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You need to think about practical things-- financial security when I die, or showing a woman how a boiler alarm clock works.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 and Tamsin's father, 14 are not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
These are the kinds of conversations that all cancer patients have to face.
But in mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not a sign of hopelessness or a sign of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought with it Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "The dead are not in danger of death".
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibres are used to harden cooking pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
A fabric was invented that doesn't burn.
I saw the towels made of it that glow in the fireplace at the banquets.
Asbestos is beginning to appear in Italy for commercial use, used in the production of paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening up in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it's an excellent insulator in steam engines and turbines.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential's statistics show that people who work with asbestos have higher mortality rates and are then denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs were undoubtedly the cause of her death.
This is the first case of its kind.
The Kershaw employees, Turner Bros. Asbestos, are not liable.
He's not paying any compensation.
During World War II, ships were built intensively, and work in shipyards posed the greatest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4 213 000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The UK's Health and Safety Executive requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
In the UK, all forms of asbestos are prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act comes into force.
A $350 million compensation program is in place.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production is at two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite mounting debate on democratic reform, the Chinese parliament on Sunday decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
The move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists have started organizing and preparing for the announcement just hours after.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to expel any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were upset", said Democratic Party Speaker Emily Lau.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lying.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership election would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, citizens will be able to vote for the executive power.
Chinese leaders have described Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also clearly shows that Chinese leaders are firmly in control of the committee nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who love the country and Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months of some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
Most pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are being led by the Occupy Central movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would begin waves of protests in the coming weeks.
But they gave no further details, apparently to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said the movement considered the occupation of the Central Office only as a last step in the event that all options for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice was left.
We regret to announce that today all dialogue options have been exhausted and the occupation of Central is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, they increased security at the government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Many Hong Kongers say that the unrest is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values like democracy and freedom of speech are being skewed by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten the Hong Kong lifeboat trade.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people are attending and for how long", says Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
That perception could hurt the investment.
Chinese state media have also in recent days come up with reports that depict Hong Kong's democratic activists as West-led subversive agents.
In the summer, activists organized an informal voting rights referendum, which attracted 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The campaign?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
A small excavation is being conducted in the town of Highland by about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is renamed the Southern League.
It was named after a movement that is running for municipal elections in October.
Ten of his candidates is also the head of the little kidnapped Jan Mráka in Jihlava.
"There was a great crowd where there was no problem", said the Cloud.
The situation surrounding the first minor league was already being addressed by the lawyers of the city hall and they recommended a change in the system of allocation of grants.
The little girl got about a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, it's hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, a small-scale procedure is not contrary to the law or the directives of the magistrates.
The situation is a motivation for the Office to adjust the rules for grant and grant allocation", said Radek Tulis, spokesman for the Magistrates' Court.
To draw the city's subsidy and at the same time express a little kick-ass support for one political party's election, that's probably not going to work anymore.
There has been no such demand from politicians for high-level football.
That the CFSP should be a regional unit, an ODS division or a KDU-CFSP 1.
And class and all that?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to have sponsors from a number of companies turn to us", noted the president of the regional football association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the little football other party and the movement in the league name will not let
According to the players, the small-scale sport in Jihlava deserves its own arena with six fields, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the stadium on the steps is not ours, we are renting it out", warned Ondrej Lapeš of Starlet Jihlava.
The best location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical ski area, which is about fifty in Jihlava", warned the Cloud.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small mine is using artificial grass playing fields in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupá, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a stadium that's going to be used to its full potential.
We're planning to upgrade or build sports facilities at the schools that will be open in the afternoon.
I think a huge step forward has been made for a small excavation in recent years", he added.
The other political parties in the league's name will not appear, according to Jan Mraz.
We have limitations.
If someone from one industry joins us, we will not be joining the other industry", he explained.
"A political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step", said Karel Voldán, a member of the city's sports commission.
"But let voters assess whether Mr. Cloud is using the Little South Kicking Association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not", he added.
American tradition is breaking into college life - freshmen can fly jet planes
We are pleased to meet the demand by launching the first luxury student travel service in Britain.
To make the best impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security page.
The service is ideal for students who would otherwise have to tow their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We're excited to be using our VIFs this year to ensure students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that as the services have only just been launched, they have no reservations yet, but added: Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "This project is unattainable for most students.
Many students entering university this month must deal with the financial crisis before they spend thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting to college, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is not keeping pace with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists stand up against racism and police behaviour after the events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer killed an unarmed young man in Ferguson, Missouri.
The crowd waiting for the funeral shouts with their hands up: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed youth Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noted a shift in online discussion of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex to race.
With the rising tensions in the Midwest, which have drawn national media attention, Peres has noticed that the white man's reaction is 100 percent race-focused.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines like "White Woman's Mindset on Ferguson" or "Feminism is Not Just About Women's Oppression" appeared relatively late.
But Peres believes this represents a major change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at that level", she said.
People felt they had to speak out about what happened.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're facing because [the Ferguson situation] is so racially biased that they had to warn us.
According to Coretta Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson highlighted the problems African Americans face every day that are not perceived as women's issues in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 characters from around the world", Mitchell said.
When I write about people of color being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk about relationships in public but not about security in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have been dealing with the issues of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
She said that black women could not afford to share these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for almost all white rape cases, Hattery said.
You needed white cooperation to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the divide between whites and blacks came when suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony explored the landscape in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could vote.
"They decided to bet on women's suffrage and black people's right to vote later", Hattery explained.
And when we realize that, we get an important insight into why women of color don't believe in white people.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for the Southern Women's Association to organize against lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
Mitchell said the response of white feminists to the issues that were taking place in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflected a time when white feminists had to address issues that black women faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?" Mitchell continued.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot in a Facebook attack, publishing a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, calling for white Americans to protest more openly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ widely in public opinion polls - will strive for change", wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on race in America confuse some people.
Christina Sommers, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Ferguson's comments are facing criticism that she has drawn earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic women, it sparked outrage among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only issue that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest this year, the issue of immigration reform has re-emerged - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to make the issue a necessity for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves", says Mercad.
Since most work permits are issued to men, the women who come with them are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations", she said.
Pig housing in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
A single-room detached house for sale for £120,000 is on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room where he rested with his head on a pig's couch.
The real estate firm Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was found there by mistake, and has since been removed", the office spokesman said.
In the property information, the real estate firm Connells described the former prayer hall as a single, single-room house.
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey City in the southwest has a new millionaire.
The lottery player at Harvey's wins a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, a lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery.
Harvey's traffic was lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was a $1 million winner.
But the lucky winner has to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole city in southwest Perth is talking about winning.
It's the main theme, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was worth it.
The eight winners in Western Australia last month split one win, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, the Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires of August, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th single winner of the Western Australian lottery this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains do not leave tonight.
The drivers want higher wages
GDL in a press release described the protest as a warning strike for which it deliberately chose off-peak traffic.
The GDL takes into account the number of people who return by train from the weekend only during the first working day.
We also think of people who come to work during the day", the union said in a press release announcing the strike on Monday morning.
'Our first strike should mainly affect freight, less passengers,' added GDL.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail links, including those with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent pay rise for engineers and a two-hour weekly reduction in working hours.
Currently, the average salary of engineers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on years worked.
DB's engineers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept wage increases in the event of shorter working hours.
They stress that the assessment of the wages of the engineers must be developed in the same way as for other railway staff for whom DB does not count on the completion of the working week.
There was a danger that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at Barum Rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a malfunction.
The car was brand new, so I never thought anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we went straight there, yes.
But we had two more ercetes to go, and we couldn't.
It's a high temperature, and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed tests at full speed.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a teenager.
We were quick, and I didn't go over the vine.
It was all because we were working on the car for over six months to get it to some level.
The race showed we did it.
You've got him so pissed you could have really thought of winning.
I prepared myself and the car so we really had a win.
The work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the outcome we could have imagined did not come.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only top-ranked player to withdraw early from the championship fight.
It also featured foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have dropped out?
- I did.
It was a shame for the audience, especially, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromir Tarabus, who you're going to be driving, has been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for flying off the track and taking a nearly two-minute break.
How was your satisfaction with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the winning streak.
He was driving the first two hours.
But Mira confirmed that we had the car ready.
He was driving really fast.
You announced your career ending just a year ago, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling about driving make you a regular rally driver again?
I'm sure not right now.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to drive it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if I get another chance next year, I'm probably gonna go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people got to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started it because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumca?
The team is moving on.
Next week we're going to Vishkov, where Robert Adolf is racing.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
Besides, he wants to borrow the fables of Honz Sykor from us for this race.
Me and Mira are in the European double in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Can you give me any indication?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you finished fifth in the series.
Isn't he tempting you to try the route again?
He's not lying.
Oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been issued a medical certificate of incapacity to work, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
You didn't immediately notify the employer of your absence.
It was subsequently agreed that the days would be registered as holidays, but the agreement was only oral.
Although the Labour Code does not require the employer to confirm in writing his consent to take leave, this has proved to be a good practice.
If only oral agreement is reached, you do not have confirmation of agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence from work may be considered as a long-term absence without excuse, thus giving rise to the immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a court dispute concerning an agreement with an employer, you lack proof.
However, your employment relationship with you has not been terminated under section 53, only that you have the dates listed in the bill as an unforgivable absence.
The absence of an unjustified statement of accounts does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of obtaining unemployment benefits), but it does make it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit your doctor again and have a written confirmation that you have actually had an accident that has left you unable to work (this is not a "disease", it is just a doctor's document).
When you are looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification of the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
You're avoiding any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track.
Back on track was the end of Tony Stewart's career just halfway down the track at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the game for the second time after his right front tyre broke in round 172 and the race was over for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car into the garage, didn't speak to reporters, and left.
His team boss, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which is next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better finish", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hoping we can do better.
Stewart hit a game for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Bush that required repair of the right side of his car.
"We've put our hopes for a good finish into today's race", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to go.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to clinch a spot on the podium.
He returned to the race during an investigation into the tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died driving Stewart into the road during the race.
The authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident will take at least another two weeks.
It's not clear yet whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started 12th, worked his way up to 10th, then even to fourth.
Then, at the start of the 122nd lap, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, went off the second turn, hit Stewart's, sending both cars into gear.
Stewart continued, but dropped to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi stand manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new manager of the taxi service.
He earns about 12.3 million crowns a year for 103 parking garages.
Until recently, the same places for taxi drivers were collected at a rate of 150 thousand crowns a year.
This was reported by Councilman Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
The city used to draw the votes to select the trustees.
The winner then received a flat rent of 1,000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
He's currently deciding the bid size.
'A year after the termination of the original leases and the opening of the tendering procedure, the new lease system has proved to be far more favourable and fairer for Prague overall,' the councillor claims.
The most expensive place is in Pershyn .
The highest price was offered to the applicants for a position on Na Perštyna Street.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Town Hall or in Václav Square.
The new rules for renting taxi cabs were adopted by the City Council in the autumn of 2012 and the original leases were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection process took place over four waves and the new manager found 29 seats.
This is the second time we've had to clean a well this year.
We'd run it all out every time, creating practically a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo in.
That is an incredible blow!
Our well in the basement always shed enough beautiful scented water.
And it wasn't as skilled as it was, Grandpa made it out of his own pocket.
It's been a long time.
She was just like three screws and totally sober, like everything else in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until next year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
After being there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we still felt that the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if something had fallen.
The place where the pump was going through, it was a bit of luck, the board wasn't quite there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we released her again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised sealing around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a pack of some bones on the floor.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a rat.
By the ceiling, in the places where the winds blow, Grandpa's invention, there were fish remains!
And the hard ones!
Our basement is also very clean.
Some would say that Grandpa just broke into the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just smothered sand, only the ceiling is broken.
They're mostly ships.
And the wheels.
And a beach couch.
The door with wide gaps was usually open as someone walked in one piece.
There are several airways on the ceiling.
No net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the tracks.
There's no point in mentioning mice.
Grandpa wanted it to float, and it did.
But now the Luft didn't help either.
The whole basement stank.
So we cleaned up the whole basement.
Especially the strawfish was nutritious!
We also threw away the things that were around: boards, heraldic plates, and so on.
Our remote cabin greeted passersby with a disinfectant.
We were wondering who might have dragged those disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She wouldn't have come to our place for lunch.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite all right.
If he didn't just blow that Franta's nasty shit out of our system?
He's been here for almost a year, having some stupid ideas.
We decided to keep an eye on the basement and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, only for washing and laundry before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest fountain is not something I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our foe.
My mother looked from the balcony and saw a long, strong black pipe in the grass next to the porch.
The red one jumped over her and whistled like crazy.
My mom made it up because she thought Reza was digging a garbage hose out of the sink.
But then the tube partially stuck in the club and partially straightened.
There's a stitch on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The caterpillar, a long, over a meter and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant frog, and Réza prevented it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the frog or eat it herself, but it didn't matter.
When the weasel saw the overwhelming force of our entire family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and elegantly went through the air into the cellar.
We flew to see her.
She jumped over the well like lightning.
By the way, we just noticed another stinking package on her plate.
I think it smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a fuss.
And we locked that cellar up all day.
That he would...
We went out and we each craved a breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's a shame behind the well.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on the neck appeared.
Then a whole lot of junk came up to the well.
She rolled around the pump and started to get inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought the company laptops and sold them
A disgraced employee bought computers from the company after his discharge and then sold them.
He spent the money he made before the police were arrested.
In a short time, a man has bought a total of 16 computers in 12 cases for more than 200,000 crowns.
"After taking the notebooks, he ventured to Olomouca, where he sold them in bazaars", said Rostislav Brückner, the high commissioner of the police for smuggling.
The motive for the fraud was to avenge the employer for firing and also to gain money.
"At the time of the interview, he said he used the money to pay off loans", Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in psychiatric hospitals.
Money could also end up in slot machines or video slot machines.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money in his house", said the Commissioner.
A con man who was once convicted of theft now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaars that bought and sold their notebooks at a discount are also subject to sanctions.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious", the Commissioner noted.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged so far.
Come on, a little bit longer, you can handle it or like I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a few changes for us.
The biggest change was the route that brought the target to the tide instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to greet our readers personally at the booth, where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my vision from the other side, I took on the role of personal guide.
Just before the start, my friend Katy and I obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We said hi to our friends who were walking around in the fast runner's section.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sports tester, countdown and start!
The cries of the horn, but instead of a quick start, there was a cupping to the starting line.
Five minutes later, we'll be at the gate, turn on the gauge, and we'll be running at 10 o'clock.
We're going to be with the yellow snake runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly setting sun in the sky gives the view of the Great Plains a nearly buzzing stench.
The pulsating flesh stretching along the shore looks like Prague is running through here.
On the shore between the Great Lakes and the National Theatre, traditionally, it's a showcase of who has the power.
A light hill on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or to walk.
Just before we head to the theater, I see a police escort and right behind it, the Pavlisht Vítek is flying at an incredible speed to the target.
I hear the wonderful, puffed up sights of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, encourage him, he's about to hit me, but just before that my leg will snap and our hands will fall apart.
Running down Theatre Street gives you a chance to rest and breathe.
It's necessary, there are places in front of us where the views can take my breath away.
The curve on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all its beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe and my legs carry me almost alone.
The first snack is a moment of truth.
As she crosses the road, Katya crashes into the ridge and makes a jump.
I'm gonna see if she needs help, and I'm gonna start a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
We're going up and down Goat Street, one of the steepest places on the track, and at this stage of the race, there's no rush, but we still need to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I don't know if the term "smallest place" will come to its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, we are frantically encouraged by tourists and fellow runners.
I try to applaud everyone who offers a hand, and I recommend that, too, because ten applause from fans is like half a power bar.
It's working, we're accelerating again, and while we've fallen pretty badly, the chase is now underway.
We're outnumbered, and when I pass someone who's particularly tired, I try to encourage them with a few words, "Come on, you can do this".
We're not getting ahead of anyone for the last snack. We're speeding up.
So far, we've been running for an hour and a half, adding, there's nothing to look forward to.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but we really need to make a move.
The sun is already setting, and the day ending symbolically ends the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight to the finish line.
The pace we're running at, I wonder where that girl is going?
"Come on, we're going under thirteen, we're making!" I call.
We try, we sprint, and here's the target.
One hour, 13 seconds.
Well, what can be done?
Coach set the 20-hour limit.
So seven minutes to the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just in time for Katya's leg break, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well-done performance.
I'll be taking her out of target area slowly after a while.
Euphoria doesn't make us think about the pressure in the locker room corridors.
You can see that Goat Street wasn't the hottest place.
That's right here behind the tide, which is under the pressure of almost 10,000 runners packed to the brink.
If someone doesn't like crowds, this isn't the place for them.
I, too, lose my mind after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route than the previous years were worth what's happening on the target.
I know from experience that running a race is not fun.
If 10,000 people are added, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire Prague transport centre is a huge challenge.
This year's change of course has shown the runners many interesting places, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The great atmosphere pumped out in the Yellow Baths was passed on to the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators graded it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, running the historic city centre has to face obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place bounded by walls on one side and a river on the other to be the best solution.
If I say the race ended in a goal, I'd say he was very good.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end, everything worked out fine.
Write us a note, if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the destination.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria attended a national protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demand for the restoration of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov, includes higher wages.
The month's watchmen symbolically protested the new hours and demanded a return to their original 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' unions and the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, reported Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The proceedings are still ongoing", said BNR Director General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Internal Affairs Employees' Trade Unions are also expected to join the prison service workers' protests.
Why can the universe be more than one dimension and we can't see it?
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit the black in 1999.
His book, The Elegant Universe, became the most accessible way for lay people to penetrate the troublesome pile of problems that many theoretical physicists are now dealing with - a quest to unite two greatly functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the search for a unified physical theory, it's not a boring story.
The fundamental problem of physics between the two key theories (for at this point our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved so imaginatively that it is worth telling even to the laity.
Greene also dealt with the complex material so freshly and engagingly that it is hard to say how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object if his book were to become obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It's quite likely that in the coming years, there will be a bit more activity in this area after all (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go full gas), and so it's a good time to enter the Green, the nonviolently open door of the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe may have more than three dimensions of space may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our gaze away from the universe as a whole to something more earthly, specifically the long, thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you are pulling a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other, and you are watching the entire landscape from a half-mile away (as shown in the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily see a long, horizontal hose, but if you're not suffering from a sharp blink, you can barely tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the pipe, you would think that the ant forced to live on the pipe has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the pipe.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the time, you can answer with one simple answer: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the tube.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile away, a long piece of pipe looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the pipe is thick.
If we magnify everything, we suddenly see another dimension - a circle shaped like a tube that rolls.
From this magnification, it is clear that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the tube, but also in the 'size in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands', around the circle diameter of the snake.
You're starting to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far away is the end of the tube and where is the looping tube on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the pipe is two-dimensional (experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of the string.
The non-disease aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the pipe is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circle, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The diameter along the pipe is long and easily visible.
The diameter of the tube's rolling circuit is short, "sweaty" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to study the pipes in much better resolution.
The above example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be either large, broad, and therefore directly visible, or small, convex and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we're not just going to jump to reveal the "scattered" dimension of the tube's thickness.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help.
But if the tube were thinner - like a hair or capillary - we would only reveal the dirty dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his paper, in which he produced the stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions we all know.
Kaluz argued his radical claim that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework within which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be drawn into a single, unified conceptual structure.
It immediately begs the question of how this Kaluz observation fits with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines, and which was clearly stated and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that just like the dimensions of the length of a tube, our universe has three dimensions, big, wide and easily visible, that we are aware of at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, rigidly wrapped in space so small that they have been hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus to date.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay with the pipeline for a while.
Imagine that we draw a fairly dense series of circles in black on the circuit of the tube.
The pipes still look like a thin one-dimensional line.
Now with the telescope, we can see the dirty dimension even more easily with the drawing, because we can see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the pipe is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so four spatial dimensions together.
It's hard to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little bit, let's look at the illustration in Figure 3. It shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In this image, we magnify the view of the geometry of space just like we magnified the surface of a pipe.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they're confined to a sufficiently small space; that explains why we haven't directly observed them yet.
The quadrangle represents the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circles represent a new, tiny, dirty dimension.
Just like the strings of thread in a tightly woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of normal size - just for the sake of clarity, we've only drawn them into the intersections of a square grid.
The background of Figure 4 shows the common structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in common scales such as meters, illustrated by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following images, we'll focus on a small area of the previous image; we'll enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
But as we move on to the microscopic properties of space geometry - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circular, swollen dimension, similar to the loop of thread in a thickly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, just as a pipe has a circular circle at every point in its length.
For clarity, we've only drawn the circle size at a few regularly placed points.
Figure 4 summarizes the idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space by Kaluz and Klein.
The similarities with the hose are obvious, although we note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spacetime dimensions (of which we've drawn only two), whereas the tube has only one large dimension.
The even more important difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our tube.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular curved dimension is extremely small, it is much harder to recognize it - as is the circular circumference of a pipe - than to observe the apparent, large, and expansive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most advanced magnification tools.
Most importantly, however, the extra dimension is not just a round pile inside normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of the three common extended dimensions.
It's a dimension in the remaining three dimensions independent just as the top-down, left-right and front-back dimensions are independent (and rectangular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four figures, in addition to the usual three still positions in the circular dimension; if we count time, then the figures five, in any case, one more than we would normally expect.

The price of an e-book is $149.
To our surprise, though, we find that although we are aware of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional curved dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe may well be more than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technology can detect structures of the size of a billion-billion-metre.
We can barely see the smaller lead dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimensions could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the discernibility of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice on the electric guitar: Part 5.
The whole essence of the "twelve" is in a twelve-act harmonic form, which you can repeat at any time.
If you're into music theory, you'll find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
Educated as a puppet and puppet rider, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic designer since graduating 20 years ago.
He's the guitarist of the Wohnout band, which he's not supposed to leave.
He's a guitarist after his father, like his brother Mattei, the leader of the Wohnuts.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is for you, you can think of anything, then you just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve", advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen to Honz, see what you can do with a twelve-string harmonica, and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can now flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for a change in pitch, Honza warns in the video.
Next time Honza comes back to the pentatonic, you're gonna try and put her together with the 12th.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you'll find out in an interview with Jan Homola at his school's first electric guitar lessons here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, the courtman admits.
We're taking the point, and we're happy for it.
"We had a better chance in the first half, we had a better chance in the second half", said the striker, who scored from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he played, but there was a huge whistle?
I didn't notice it in particular, although I think it would have been worse on the other gate, where there are home fans.
You tied the penalty in half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty in less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We were asleep at first, we were passive, we were born from that horn and then the penalty.
You got up after that, and in the first half, you were a better team, with a better chance.
Why did things change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree, we played well until the break after the goal was scored.
We were in the cabin and we thought we'd keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also probably true that the housewives said something about their game about the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You've only scored your first goal on the field, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more about us how we deal with it.
We started well at the gate, but then it was bad for us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
You've been waiting for four games to score, weren't you worried that after last game, it might be the same?
Maybe not, but of course we're glad we don't have to listen to the talk of waiting for a goal since last game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which isn't even close to being a big celebration.
- Iceland's lava flows from a mile away crater.
A hunting bird flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flowing through an underground tunnel from a kilometre away crater.
It's under the ice, as is part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now the most disturbing to scientists...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still comes out of the crack with about the same amount of lava.
However, its quantity is lower than the original estimates, not 1000 m3, but 'only' 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, and at the same intensity as the current eruptions, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsa a Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
A strong smell of sulfur is felt around the eruption, clouds of steam and gas rising from the crack.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also much more gases", says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
But the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with the area almost windless in the early hours.
The trail of the sandstorm was washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the rank of orange (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askju is applicable.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
It's a flying day in Cheba.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 introduced the flight acrobat Peggy Walentin, who flew from the cockpit to the stern on the top wing of the twin-engine and also between the wings.
There, it's only based on muscle strength.
Cheba Flight Day was already in its fifth year, and the organizers have again managed to prepare some interesting pieces of flight.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only a "walk on the wings" by German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shiny demeanor.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to do so.
But because of the high number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
But today, he's slowly returning to the flight schedule.
Peggy will be out of the cockpit on the top wing after launch.
He's doing a lot of exercises there.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues", Luděk Matěček of the Chebsky Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day described.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cake cherry.
The legendary fighter played the Czech Army Grippena in the curtain on the field.
This is the first time a fan of the airline in the Czech Republic has seen such a set.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavsky then showed everyone a breath-taking aerobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
It was made during the war, but he probably never participated.
He was in the Army Reserves.
He's been in the civil service since 1963.
Even as a race plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the Munich Airport.
In the same place is another pearl of Cheberian aviation, the two-engined Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no big machine at the airport to overlook.
His polished aluminum coat shone in the distance.
The admirer also got the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force.
A small transport plane jumped over a discarded Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Germany's Hof for the flight day.
The German neighbors were performing in Cheb with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of twin-engined Bücker Jungmann.
A dramatic comeback on camera!
Lucie Borhy has traded parental responsibilities for work, at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was doing well on the moderated TV news, as if she hadn't stopped seeing him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since a blonde finished sixth, when women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
But Lucie will not be appearing regularly on TV Nova's main newscast yet.
She's not expected to return for a month, according to Blesk.cz.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs her more than a TV audience now.
Lucie Borhy came back on the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
The exhibition next year in Prague?
The hall would sell, he's planning a farewell
It would be dignified if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it matters how the union stands", he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Game, where the stunning Nagaan team met again.
And the players who took part in the golden hat trick.
Players would like to, wouldn't they?
I'm sure you will.
It would be nice to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think there's a couple days during the tournament where there's a full day off and where to put a game like that.
We'll tell Gum or Béda Scherban who'll take over...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I fly in...
You don't want to play for the national team.
Or did the headline meeting change your mind?
Representation and an exhibition match are two different things, and in representation, there are decisive performances.
One thing is, people would love to see me there, but performance is crucial, especially for the world championship.
It's where the players who are good enough should be, not because they have a good reputation.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagans meeting?
Just meeting the players was great.
You brought the stories to life and you had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was to honor Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir the Pink and Petr the Chechman on the alternate.
You still remember your first national team game?
You never forget that kind of thing.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we got into a threesome.
It was the first national team start for all of them.
Well, you can't say we're dominating in any way.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hashek was caught a long time ago.
What did you say about his performance?
I'm never surprised by a hashish on the ice.
I wanted to return the criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticized Yagra for the reasons he decided to end up in the national team).
Even the rabbit did a great job.
He was out with me one night, and he was a hooker.
And now he's catching a celebrity.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the football players start qualifying
On Monday morning, prominent guests were seated at the NH Hotel in Smykhov.
People could see Peter Czech, Chelsea goalkeeper, team coach Pavel Vrb...
And there, that character in the black skirt, that's Tom Rosicrucian!
Arsenal's goalkeeper and team captain came to the meeting at around 12:30 am among the last.
We're looking forward to a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be excited?" he said, as he appeared before reporters in the national team.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of the race, first training
Tuesday, September 2: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the draw
Russian and the Associates can support fans even before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The representation has opened a training session for them on Tuesday, which begins at 6:30 p.m. on the Summer.
And then there's an autograph, which neither the Russian nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise, the national team's meeting will be calmer.
Which is a compliment from coach Vrba, who just complained about the amount of social events in the spring.
We're finally going to do what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been done before", praised Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musket image as they enter the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches in a row under the Wrba, all in preparation.
She tied Norway and Finland 2-2 and lost to Austria 1-2.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The match against the Netherlands will kick off the qualification process for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, the Czech team would have been helped if they could make the general against the USA.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now, the results are important.
We must think about it to be successful", agreed Vrba.
The only player in the 23-man roster who has a medical condition is striker David Lafat.
He's got a fever.
If he doesn't recover for Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba will call in another forward.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how she thought she would die for many years after being misdiagnosed.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking that she had only a few years to live.
It was actually Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, impaired walking and sprained toes.
In the case of those affected, numbness or pain may also occur, which is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms may worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she had Freidreich's ataxia, a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead by the time she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride a roller or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school for walking and running.
When Rodgers was 13, and she was after several surgeries that were supposed to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her legs, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her file, where she learned she had FA.
"I felt guilty for following, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, I was totally panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and planning my funeral.
At 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it'll be something much less life-threatening.
After passing several genetic tests, it was discovered that she had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid", she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to raise awareness of the disease.
Washington businessmen: taxes are rising as the economy turns
Growing economies mean more customers, more sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxes in a country that has accelerated economic recovery have risen slightly over the past year, and businesses in Washington have been no exception.
In fiscal year 2013, Maryland and Virginia businesses together contributed $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries, up 3.8% from $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion from 3.9 percent last year, the third year in a row since 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the Centre on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, comes from the estate tax, and 36%, of Maryland's revenue, comes from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the lowest corporate tax rate.
The researchers argue that the majority of the growth in tax revenue comes from the increase in the value of property owned by companies, which increased property taxes by 3,7% this year after three consecutive years of growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be the case in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, an annual increase of 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate tax.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes represent almost half of state and local taxes.
"Maryland has a lot of real estate owned by businesses, especially the D.C. tax base, the government or nonprofit organizations that don't pay taxes", explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
The data show that business income is also increasing.
Companies in this region have disclosed a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as rapidly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was on a national average of 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, there was a below-average tax increase of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of 6% of all three counties (all of which have the same taxation).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9,975.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a bill that would cut corporate tax from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as did Virginia, and next year it's going to be reduced to 5 percent.
The Commission therefore concludes that the State would not be able to meet the tax rate set by the State in the year to come.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and that's why they pay higher state and local taxes.
The lifetime tax levied by small business owners as a personal income tax - the structure of compensating for cost increases by raising prices that most businesses are organized under - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers claim that the trend and the national increase in the excise duty are likely to continue next year, with the total sales tax revenue for state and local governments increasing to 6,2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may fall behind others because cutting government spending is taxing its labor market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin's Novoslav, and Lafat's scissors will be the head of Europe.
Will a new state be established in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been fighting pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they would have difficulty returning to the Russian market after the current anti-Russian sanctions regime.
He said the Western support for the war on the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is against democratic values.
He says the end of the conflict is up to Kiev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic has acquired the right to disagree with part of the
The European Commission and diplomats are due to propose a form of further sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was told to the press by the permanent chairman of the meeting of the Member States, Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the lifting of sanctions should be ready by Monday.
Tusk will be the new "president" of the Union.
He will replace Van Rompuy in December.
The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit to head the European Council, the so-called Union President, which conducts the summits of the member states.
He's replacing Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
The European diplomacy is headed by the Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, who replaces Catherine Ashton.
Italy, which will become the future Vice-President of the European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only not talked about
Helping an incurable, long-suffering patient with a life-threatening illness?
In Czech lands, where the law does not allow euthanasia, it is not legally possible.
However, the comments of the doctors contacted by LN indicate that they are hearing such requests.
ALS: The toughest chapter in neurology, says a doctor on sclerosis
In the Czech Republic, about three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 of whom are undergoing experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We don't know if it's going to be a success.
But if we don't try, we won't find out", says Radim Mazanec, a moths neurologist.
It's the CIA's handwriting, they needed a war, Huml writes about the MH17 shooting down.
The deputy for the USSR, Stanislav Huml, has a clear idea of who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions imposed in connection with the shooting down of a civilian plane with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian military".
The lawmakers say that's the CIA's handwriting.
Unfulfilled promises.
The election is coming and the parties are again offering the impossible
End of homelessness on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
Before every election, it's like this: the parties promise the impossible.
Now, too, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are pushing ahead who the voters will like the most.
The server lidovky.cz has chosen unfulfilled promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
The siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the replacement of technical equipment and the deployment to the front.
The British side eventually agreed and placed this land force as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the hands of German troops.
Souhr: Spinach leads the league ahead of the Prague "S", Liberec declined
Victoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by a point from both Prague "S".
The change in the lead led to the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Young Boleslav.
After two defeats in the domestic league, Sparta recovered, thanks to two Lafat attacks, defeating Jablonec.
The record win of the year was tied by Liberec, who shot the Ostrava Mine 6-0.
62 thousand people at the ball?
The Poles say yes
The introduction of the volleyball players in Warsaw brought a record audience.
At the football stadium under a closed roof, 62,000 spectators watched the home-country victory over Serbia.
Tickets sold out in 100 minutes.
How do you survive coming home from vacation?
Don't rush anywhere and get some sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to working at a normal pace after returning from a sunny beach or cottage can be a challenge for many nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with the change: Stay up to date and get quality sleep.
The Joan Rivers family:
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since being admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has expressed hope that the 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her toes.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a 911 call said she had a cardiac arrest at the Yorkville Endoscopy on the Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors will intentionally keep her under sedative and strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains serious.
The reaction was quick, including tremendous online support from figures like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
The fact that the media is twisting reality with its headlines is (unfortunately) not news.
I know the headlines sell newspapers, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more aptly the word anger.
This is particularly true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are quite common: "Israel attacked Gaza".
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often during the period of the declared ceasefire.
Then the headline comes out, "Both sides have broken the ceasefire".
Is the press community aware that it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been more than 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still people alive who survived the Shoah.
When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd shouted "Jewish pigs" and similar loyalties, I was stunned.
Is the world trying to finish what Hitler didn't?
Do our journalists realize the fact that Jews were destined to wipe out the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You're often called the "watchdog of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech people and wipe the Czech Republic off the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also consider one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're doing well there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their own, say, to Gaza, will they tell you why they would?
They have jobs, social security and top-notch health care in Israel (I have seen firsthand how Arab people are also regularly admitted and treated at the top private Hadassah hospital, which is funded by donations from Jews around the world).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even if it's in the headlines.
Inform us about Hamas' practices, its use of people as human shields.
Tell them that Hamas is aiming to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Inform them that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Tell them that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity to Gaza, but the Gaza Strip administration does not pay for it and is even angry that the power is sometimes cut off during this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel, but for example, in housing, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed Monday morning's Information: An online retailer - a producer of videos and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement was a surprise, not because no one expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because YouTube was expected to buy it.
Three months ago, the one billion-dollar sale of Twitch to Google seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv only three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online game transmissions to - in the words of Business Insider YouTube for live streaming games .
The interface of Twitch.
YouTube has already seen popular videos of Let's play, a genre where wise men (mostly older) give toys of Mystery Science Theater processing.
The fact is that YouTube is getting a lot of shakes when it describes Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn't really get anyone excited, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster".
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about watching games instead of actually playing.
It's one thing to watch a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 a.m. playing Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 strokes in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I'll admit, speed run games where Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish a game in record time are fun.
But if someone isn't a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly hits and is the fourth-highest-grossing website.
How exactly is Amazon going to use that?
It's hard to imagine Twitch interfering with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming and the media don't seem to be hesitating or even swallowing the audience.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist blogger Aaron Ra.
This time, the theme is "The Holy Scriptures Are God's Word".
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers discuss one of many things that is contrary to their religion, we are often asked, Who will you believe?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
As if human investigation were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man", they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to myths about God written by humans.
If there is indeed an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulae that match it, and it must be he who provided a series of other evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, tell fables.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or who may have listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were not written by anyone but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really were one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire universe.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to measure up to such a work.
And people wouldn't have to blindly believe it because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond human limits.
It would have inspired every reader to unite in a common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of one religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, all of which are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each in some way claiming divine guidance, despite the continuing fragmentation and division in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Kitab-i-Akdas of Baha'u'llah, the Zoroastrian Avesta, the Sikh Adí-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God", and the faithful in each of them say that the others are deceived.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the wrong side to some extent.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of these require faith and also apologizing because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true that have already been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by prophecy - each of them also containing unfulfilled prophecies.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual commentary.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some scholars now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, or the five "Books of Moses", and attribute none to Moses because he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered out at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docet and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these corrections relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the New Testament authors decided to ridicule and change Baal Zebub, "Lord of the Mountain", to Beelzebub, "Lord of the Fly".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the Nikaja Sanhedrin.
Four Gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in Christian centers at the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
And what about the Roman church at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the very core of the early church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
Yet, they deliberately took more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by approved ones.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and prophets.
Why should God's Word refer to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of legend, parable, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by men and certainly not by too much enlightenment, but quite the contrary!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it's about anything from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that using a magic wand to spray blood on someone would cure leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were predators and bats were birds and whales were fish and pie that it was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or encouraged cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, plunder, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
Why?
Because if creationists didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one thing and another are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation rather than the Creator".
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the rejection of their supposedly "holy" books somehow contradicts God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that there could be a god and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were the god himself, because they think they are his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that humans approved or rejected in their supposedly "unchanging word" of any god was invented, compiled, assembled, translated, interpreted, edited, and often also deliberately altered and twisted by mere errant humans.

An attacker stabbed nine people at a Chinese school, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, forced into the elementary school building this morning and attacked around 11:30 local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later committed suicide by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks on schools and children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security and better protection of children in a country where many couples have only one offspring, in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-year students in Laene how to sit in school
The youngest students took the nine to their classroom, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He showed the kids how he had to sit in school by himself.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, thankfully you're not here anymore, you're single people", Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the firstborn as a gift to the heads.

Minister of Education Marcel Chladek has opened a new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more", approached one of the reasons why he went to the north of the Czech Republic on the first day of school.
The school board recently called him at a hockey game in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to attend the opening of the school year", the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) has opened the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
115,000 first-year students entered the first year of school.
Over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will attend secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of the news agency is David Fiala
The new art director of news and publicity for Nova TV has been David Fiala since September 1.
He succeeds Alan Zarub, who has been the creative director of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of Z1 news.
For the past two years, under the direction of Alan Zarubá, he has been involved in the implementation of complete visual transformation of news programs of the TV newspaper, Sträepiny, Prajsk! and other publicity programs of the TV Nova.
David Fiala is very good at the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and the graphics department, which is the essence of the art director's job.
It has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to move forward in the visual news of Nova", says Nova's creative director Alan Zruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly fell victim to hackers, and nude photos of celebrities were released to the public
Screenshot of the leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan's server is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the US server Mashable.com has warned.
The alleged infringement was allegedly obtained through unauthorised access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them via automatically backing up images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities dismiss the images as fakes, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, best known for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Death Trap 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos they've acquired to enrich their lives.
The footage was reportedly picked up by American magazines, but according to reports on 4chan's server, the hacker prefers to get money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it's very likely that this is actually a vulnerability in iCloud security.
A tool was introduced on GitHub two days ago that allowed users to access passwords to their accounts by using brute force, which is automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was released.
For the purposes of this Decision, the Commission should adopt implementing acts laying down the rules on the application of the rules on the use of the information provided by the Member States.
The key is the length of the password, not the complexity.
A minimum of 12 characters is appropriate.
The leak of celebrity nude photos is a reminder of safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is a risk that is unnecessary.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading them.
It is also wise to set up automatic photo backup from your phone to run only on Wi-Fi and after you connect to a charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images to safety in time, and most importantly, you'll have space to delete unclaimed images so they don't take up space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communicate on the Internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an e-book by Michal Altair Valášk in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save for College Scripts
Since the cost of a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the incoming sophomore came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system to borrow books from high school classmates with a nominal compensation offer to keep them from selling back.
"I got a calculation book, which normally costs $180, for a semester at ten and chicken nuggets", says Schroeder, 19, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
He's spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and tutorials, but students have different options for managing those expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's are becoming the students' preferred choice.
The rise of book lending allows students to use the book during the semester, often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the response shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the past spring semester, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Stores, less than half of textbooks are purchased in university bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Online shopping
Prices for some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larsson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's book Calculus is nearly $290, but it is available online at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, to purchase a new one for $239.99.
Buy used
If you are not disturbed by other people's comments or wear and tear, textbooks are an appropriate option.
The Calculus is on sale at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the used edition of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, the dean of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes, the changes in the seminary are not essential.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Loans
Borrowing textbooks is also a consideration if you treat them well, remember to return them, and do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a Calculus for about $20 for a semester.
Please note the terms and conditions of the business in which you borrow the book, including the impact of notes, highlights or wear and tear.
Please note: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to replace a regular e-book with an e-book.
In some cases, these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for about $61.
Bracey says that the best deals are available to students of literary courses, since many classics are now available for free download, while natural science and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, because it guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, Gault advises that you make sure it's actually in storage.
He's convinced himself of it.
The book he bought sold out in four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
The mud, the mud itself.
And then they found a torso of rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well is just outside St. George's.
We discovered the growth around and started to pull out the floating soil -- about a foot and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the bottom of the mud, we hit a head", said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it to be a torso of German assault rifles used by SS units.
The find is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were not produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them", added the Novak.
All the wooden construction stuff has broken down over time, so it's useless.
But her body is preserved - it retains its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's one explanation.
It may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably for fear of being displaced.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods", the discoverer thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the Ghost of the Autumn Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them everywhere, so we slowed down the excavation work, we scrutinised the mud carefully to avoid any disaster, but there was nothing else down there", Novák said.
The find will end up in the museum's warehouse at the castle nearby in Silesian Rudolts.
I have not released the captured Czech so far
Exclusive interview with Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who is liberating Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
"I'm sorry, I have to take this... they call me from Donetsk", said at least eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Prisoner of War Liberation Center there.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers, or where they are - or should be - Ruban is clarifying with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there", he finished one of the flashy discussions with Donetsk and turned to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserves, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in Maidan.
Yesterday, when we were having an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian troops from the captivity of the pro-Russian separatists is being devoted 24 hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates the number at 30.
There may be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed the Serbs, Dagestan, Chechens, one Swede, one Georgian... but not the Czech Republic yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured compatriot and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.C.: What advice do you give the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian troops?
They should understand that if they fight in Ukrainian volunteer battalions like the Czechs and are captured by the separatists, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigners.
The separatists consider these men mercenaries and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian troops capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including the Czech Republic - they will put them behind bars and treat them as prisoners of war.
The guy's gonna live.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, I'll trade you.
Some sources say that it has long since surpassed a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
We only liberated them... not saved them from the war if they chose to continue fighting.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons in war, but we certainly aren't.
That's the way it is.
And every day, more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to free the prisoners.
A.C.: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained a great deal of authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as from Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev nicknamed me "crazy general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that's what our work is all about.
As head of the Ukrainian Board of Trustees, I have gained some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm being honest and telling the truth.
Even when it's very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
I'm just telling them they're torturing and killing them.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job can mean the end for me anytime... I don't have to go back.
A.C.: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long delay)... the torture of prisoners is used by Ukrainians and separatists in interrogations.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What about executions?
They only take place on the muddy side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also correcting prisoners.
Nor any sign that the Ukrainian army is doing anything like that.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't give the numbers and I don't want to.
A.C.: Describe the character and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They're officers, but they're also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with the Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists have already had their teeth full of oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to life and death.
Like we say, they've been eating them all the way down their throats.
The same dreams and aspirations were expressed by the people of Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating a little bit: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
But this sentence of mine already contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.C.: For example, what do you think of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of battle, I'm unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred yards on a fly or in an optical gauge.
I can see the faces of people pointing at me, and they can pull their trigger at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He's considered a Russian officer, but his family, his mother, lives in Ukraine.
He believes Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just like a small governorate in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time and considers Ukraine to be a misunderstanding.
He doesn't think there should be a state like that.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.C.: Speaking of characters, in a talk show on Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Jaceynuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best to leave quickly.
I'm always scared at least five times for those 300 meters of walking.
So why should I hide the idea that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.C.: Do you think he's involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jaceňuk "Rabbit".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians to be feared or to be respected and respected by others.
His behavior directly mimics the behavior of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to step down... he must run the country, run it and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, a break from mourning emotions.
He's the first minister of Ukraine.
What about Jace?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save the Sales
Lost 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from a $90 million US budget and Sin City: The Woman I Would Kill for only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
The first weekend of the film, Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz, only grossed $14.6 million, and children's films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment to theaters.
According to the Telegraph article by film critic Robbie Collins, the quality of children's films is at stake.
Collin called 2014 the worst year of children's films and How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere sequel.
When it comes to movies that are targeted at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is similar in quality to last year's hits.
Some commentators say that the change in viewership and the increased popularity of internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing.
We have to admit it and not try to go after what's already there.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash crunch, Netflix's net income from internet services has reached $1.2 billion, almost double that of last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the collapse of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators have suggested that there may be something about his catastrophic prognosis.
With the release of potential big box office hits in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Alien and Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline as simply cyclical. He told the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history and no one will have to worry about sales".
DPRK threatens Seoul again, firing another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Soul announced.
The alleged missile test was conducted shortly after the end of joint US-South Korean military maneuvers, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for an invasion.
Changang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman, according to DPA, said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a rocket from Chaagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
I heard there's an underground launch pad for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the situation over the weekend and talking to protesters who were travelling from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be flown from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a hike to Govett's Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police at about 8:00 p.m.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and a couple were found around 11:00 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed overnight and picked them up Monday morning.
They were transported by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition.
The pencilman brought only a point from the Oopava, the win was on your leg
The 23-year-old forward could have made the decision, but he didn't make the two biggest choices.
The main call for the goal was a shot close to three minutes before the end, but instead of the net, it ended up at the goalkeeper of Opava Joseph Queton.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself", your little man poured ashes on his head.
"I should have put it higher under the lid, I was a little shy", he thought.
Sigma's defense didn't allow much of that Opah, except for Mikul's 11th-minute raid, which covered Reichl's goalkeeper.
Then the Hanans started pushing, but the block's defending home did not let them in and the shells were intercepted by the Flower from a distance.
We were comparing for 15 minutes, then we took the lead.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of a game, and Opava only threatened us from standard situations.
But your little boy didn't change his chances, and it ended 0:0", said Hanak coach Leo Calvad.
Opava also scored a point because of absences in the squad, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal shooter Petr Ševčić, who are guests of Sigma in Silezia, were also missing.
Unlike her previous policies, she did not allow them to join.
Replacements deserve discharge.
Sigma seemed more football, but we didn't let her do anything except one standard", said Sledans coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably earned, the point is a decent profit for us", he added.
Sigma's draw is four points clear, which means 13th place.
Nothing that would satisfy club boss Joseph LeBron, who after losing to Znojm conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the box office by diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so there can be no question that the boys would not want to fight", Calvoda noted, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter, Vasiček: "I believe it will come and when he scores, he will start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I'll replace him immediately so he can save goals for the next games", Calvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has been in Venice twice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After the huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Innarrit was one of the serious contenders for the Golden Lion, the next few days were a sign that interest in the 71st Venice Film Festival had fallen somewhat.
Whether it was because the seating capacity in the largest theater had increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman's critically acclaimed but less appealing images followed, such as a documentary on the 1960s Indonesian genocide, the silent and other social-themed films from the American 99 homes to the Iranian Story, the cinemas were simply empty.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been filled with crowds like in the past, and it is said that it is no longer a problem to find a place at the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is the most talked about in Italy and it is no wonder that it has affected institutions as respected as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis is not characterized by a lack of personalities, but by those who are present only in the context of films.
While younger fans have longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully landed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without distinction, the visit of legendary actor Ala Pacino has become a major event.
He's been in two movies.
In the off-competition tale "The Vision", which was adapted by Oscar-winning Barry Levison from Philip Roth's novel, seventy-four-year-old Pacino plays a role close to his own: a celebrity-topping actor who suffers from career-ending and personal depression.
But seeing him the very next day as a strange ironworks owner from a rural town in the movie Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly memorable experience.
Volpi's best performance should not be missed, but does a Pacino-style artist still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to say that his grandparents came from the country.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film since Birdman to receive a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the Mafia is seen through the family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director was able to match all the prerequisites for a good film: good script, camera, music and actor.
He also starred in the psychological thriller Hungry Heart, which starred Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher as a woman who nearly kills her own child with her own anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films have not received a warm reception, neither the Glory Relief nor the 3 Hearts, both works adhering to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, aren't so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival's films are all depressing, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a comedy show in Venice that was filmed outside the competition and was set in the style of the 1940s American carols, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, bringing drugs from Poland
"Detectives have detained in recent days three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who from November last year to August this year manufactured and sold drugs pervitin in Prague 9", police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the Cihlarska Street task force caught a 42-year-old organiser and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The next day, the detectives detained another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the DA.
The last of the four was caught by police in the early hours of Wednesday, August 20, in the area of the malaysia fire station", the spokeswoman described.
A woman was getting a third of the drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřicie, in the apartment on Koněvová Street and elsewhere in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, supplied various aids and chemicals necessary for its production and provided for the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the drug, distributed it into plastic bags, and then sold the perv.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman who had not been punished.
For this she received a reward from the organiser in the form of a third of the drugs produced", Rössler added.
The forensics also conducted several home searches on the judge's orders, where they seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, hoses, and other devices and items that experts believe could be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been jailed seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organiser had been convicted of property crime seven times since 1995 and the woman had not been convicted", the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was convicted of a sexual assault offence in 2006 on probation and the 37-year-old mechanic, who is on parole, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
He was also charged with property offences.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with the crime of illegal manufacturing and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
The three people were eventually turned over to the prosecutor and the prosecutor asked for a request for arrest, which the judge eventually placed them in", the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, ended up on parole.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as the other defendants.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers very interesting things at very "interesting" prices as part of its other products.
A good example is handmade chess pieces with a 42 x 42 cm playing board in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 cents.
The customer will receive a set of black and red painted wooden figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibres.
It is no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If you don't like chess as a gift, you can also get a Ferrari 500 F2 made (handmade, of course) at a scale of 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Closing up high schools and colleges doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few people with a general education and statistics show that high school students have good jobs.
The start of the school year is here.
There's been a lot of preparation in the schools over the last 14 days.
It's usually routine, like moving flowers from the summer storage to the classroom and sucking the wings.
They're gonna have a little bit more fuss at the Myrtle High School.
A few days before the season begins, they collect furniture, computers, and other technical equipment and literature from the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Gorizia reopens and resumes operations after three years.
Not in public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incapable.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school was confirmed by entering the school register administered by the MŠMT.
French socialists should shut up and put France in order, says key ally Francoise Holland
Valls calls on the severely dispersed left to show its support for a warlike socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the consent of the majority of Frenchmen.
The president deserves all the respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said, and applauded.
As a peaceful gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French thirty-five-hour workweek, despite the passionate speculations of Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week that the rules be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande urged the Socialists to stay in touch with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubir made a budget line for him when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs where she criticized the Socialist Party for losing faith in the future to the French.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the constant internal strife between socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one didn't last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter", Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, stating that she was convinced that the party could win the early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the municipal elections in March and in May the far-right won the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term in office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing", he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
There will be no more games on the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dog breeding.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees until the October elections.
"The decision on the changes should not be made by the current city council, whose mandate expires in a few weeks", said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to ban gambling in their territory.
But the game won't go away, the gambling bill won't change yet.
It's the job of the new city manager after the election.
We would not be able to do this now, technically, given, for example, the deadlines for comments and the like,' Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current House of Representatives, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on 11 September.
A referendum on a complete ban on gambling is due to take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is prohibited in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The bill will not change for the same reasons as street art, so-called busking.
The complaint is particularly directed at Prague 1, which has already sent the Magistrates' Court a proposal for places to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Prague 5 doesn't want musicians around the Angel.
The city's been planning a dog-breeding bill for months, but it's not finished yet.
The placement of the games and the problem of busking are addressed by the city ordinances.
Only the representative office of the capital can issue or edit them.
The councillors have only a council vote, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week he put the victory for Scottish independence at the mercy of the Scottish people.
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making the same mistake a third time, when it almost put the question on billboards across Scotland whether Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you earn their respect by threatening them.
The moral of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots tend to drive money changers out of temples far more than they do to be told how to vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond knew this well, and so in a televised debate he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a mask.
Of course Darling will not support the Scottish voter mandate.
But the debate over what kind of currency Scotland will have has been largely neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, the job opportunities and the public health defense that citizens get for free.
Darling has supported London's bankers on the currency issue and has also made it appear that he will not protest the privatization of healthcare.
By, as Salmond put it, "going to bed with the conservatives".
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters but to the "bosses' association", the Confederation of British Industry.
It's becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent-minded housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What it says is clear: Scots must not jump out and accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
A pessimistic start to school by Miloš Urban

Milos Urban The longest year
The end of the holidays was the best, the last week, where it was nowhere to go, and we just had a little fun and a little summer with the ladies, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, if you could get them from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Quick Arrows, in the 50's, riding a bike up a mountain around the Empire, back behind the Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun was shining on his back and shoulders, the beams were beaming goodbye.
A mild nighttime nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleeping until 11:30 a.m., a week later, it's worse, the moments before bedtime stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then getting up at 7:30 a.m.
He's coming on Monday.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer is a vicious time of bad luck before school.
To slip into the ghostly light of a sheet and feel like a plastic figure in a glass mine, there's that school, ZDŠ A.
The western with the monstrously pink scrub, and before her old familiar faces and a couple new ones, boys more outstanding, girls more fat.
They're awful, they're awful to avoid, and it's just as interesting how they're so unmistakably tight and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming, they're laughing hysterically now, and I think their holidays have changed something in their lives, while I'm all the way back.
And new first-borns, some nervous and other excitement, why are they even coming here?
Because they have to, the military's education is compulsory.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately still the same one that they say will lend a student keys from a tin closet where they can keep textbooks and there are still so few of them.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress is still in the memory, it's not working now, it's pretty windy, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
Just the thought of it makes my stomach ache and my head ache.
A title that will take a lesson in mathematics even worse, that devil's game for the chosen, of which I am not and never will be.
Again, the three and four, the five, the goddamn five, hiding from the trial, falling into the bench and getting better, being there or not, just being a name in the classroom and dreaming stories of cute girls and pretty buildings, antennas to a universe where no one is competing with anyone, humiliating anyone, and not trampling anyone.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now like years ago.
She let her newborn daughter die.
She 's facing an extraordinary punishment .
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet at a bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, a baby girl was born, which she wrapped in a ready-made blanket, hid under her jacket, and carried to the sidewalk, where she placed it in the bushes a few hundred feet from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
I guess I got it a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school", the defendant described, saying she was embarrassed by the pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the scene, put the child's body in a suitcase and carried it away, took the body out of the suitcase, packed it in a black ivory bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlicko Brod", the lawsuit says, noting that it is not entirely clear when the newborn died.
It could be tens of minutes or even hours after birth, suffocation while covering a blanket or putting it under a jacket, hypothermia, or bleeding from an unbound spleen.
A similar scenario was repeated the following spring.
A woman has secretly delivered again at an undisclosed time, between February and April 12, when the child's body was found by random witnesses under a shrub by a pond in Havlikobrodsk.
This time in the bathroom of the penthouse in the family home.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the spine that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wrappers, including an ice pack, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend showed her
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who was not aware of the partner's pregnancy.
And for that reason, he's not in court now, except he was convicted of a crime against the funeral home law.
He was also the one who later turned himself in to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the baby against my wishes.
I know my decision was wrong, but it seemed human at the time", the defendant, who was allegedly in a relationship with the man and feared him, was not hiding her anger.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke quite calmly.
Tears filled her eyes as she spoke about her relationship with her parents, whom she left alone when she was a teenager.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"They come to visit me every 14 days, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it", she said.
I didn't borrow the gear because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put it in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain it to you", she answered the judge's question.
But she refused to act with the intention and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, she claims, was also born dead.
But she didn't stop drinking alcohol even during her pregnancy.
I've been restricting it.
And he didn't drink hard.
I also cut back on smoking", she said.
Although she was pregnant in both cases, she told everyone, even repeatedly, that she had health problems, that she was pregnant.
And a friend of mine.
The main proceedings will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday, as the court experts have said.
The verdict could be delivered by Wednesday.
A woman is facing a maximum penalty of 18 years in prison, or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion takeover of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world's third largest cruise ship operator, has advanced the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The transaction would allow Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion and competing with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N), access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruise ships and wealthy customers.
The deal could be made public this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that negotiations may not yet end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources declined to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises officials have not responded to requests for comment, and Apollo spokesman declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The 29 billion-dollar segment of cruise shipping is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India over the coming year.
Companies are competing to make them the preferred choice for these customers when choosing cruise ships.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 when it closed a $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a capital stake of 28%, Apollo 20% and private investment firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation, the first public tender covers Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together, 82 percent of the North American passenger volume.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are provoking Chinese authorities the day after the vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates should contest the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first obtain the support of the Appointments Commission, which will likely be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge and cripple Hong Kong's financial centre for the Occupy Central protest movement.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with Chinese officials worried that demands for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June denouncing Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city's business district.
A press conference to be held by Prime Minister Li is being organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communications Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Zhang Ronghsun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they're meeting outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on state sovereignty
According to Russian newspaper accounts, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called on the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the state sovereignty of the sequestered areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's remarks did not mean to suggest that the areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking area would be given the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with a clear strategy that has followed since the unrest erupted five months ago: Help the separatists occupy territory and allow the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorussia de facto independence so that it can instead join the West with Russia.
In an interview with state TV's first channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions aimed at reclaiming eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have designated the recently occupied territories as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words saying that anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon is a prisoner of illusion because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-held areas.
In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on legal issues but also on the political organisation of society and the status of the sovereignty of the state of southeast Ukraine he declared.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was conceived in the context of wider autonomy, which the Kiev leadership has been dealing with for several months and which is intended to alleviate concerns in Russian-speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the Eastern Region.
This is not a matter for negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin's intervention, which was intended to correct the misinterpretation of Putin's remarks, highlighted the approach of Russia's leadership to resolve the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million is ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have a much greater problem annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and public opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is home to the main Russian naval fleet, maritime trading base and historic coastal resorts.
The area between Russian Rostov and Crimea is also a centre of mining, factories and smelters that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his June 7 inaugural address, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider constitutional changes that would give the diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the Kremlin and the separatists' vision that Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call to Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed another advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from the formerly quiet region along the Sea of Azov invaded eastern Ukraine.
Separatists reinforced by Russia have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This has accelerated the massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with a metallurgical combined capacity of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the European Union's top officials in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
We are approaching a point of no return, Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The photo scandal involves Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko.
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest celebrity photo hacking scandal ever took place in which a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence went online.
Hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud leak also reportedly released personal footage of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and all private photographs should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and released to the public.
Greece, now in New York, reportedly told online newspapers that the hack was "unfortunate" and that those who became its targets felt humiliated.
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him unplugged upstairs by the pool.
Palmer, for example, starred in Love and Honor, where her counterpart Liam Hemsworth was.
Palmer, TV star Chuck Strahovski and actress Sucker Punch Browning have not commented on the stolen footage.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a clear violation of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly like selling stolen goods".
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma football players have won the league without a win
The clouds and lightning that the Sigma Sigma co-owner Josef Lebr sent to his subordinates last week seem to be in the past.
Only a point for a draw from Opava.
They've gotten a little better with the club boss's deployment and fighting.
The payroll money could be coming to the club soon.
"I'll keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic", Lebr confirmed, saying that despite Sigma's failure to win, his players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and the deployment we played with mostly in the second half was exactly what I wanted the players to see.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that it won't.
If we had played like this since the start of the season, I'm sure we'd still be out of the game", Lebr thinks.
Sigma stopped the initial pressure from the home team in Opava, then tied the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, the Calvots reached, but they did not reach the goal, and they could not win.
The result is not what we imagined.
To our complete satisfaction, we were missing only one changed opportunity", said Lebr, who does not think the change in approach to football was caused by his threat.
There must have been more than one aspect.
Whether it's my side, the coach's side, or the fans' side", said Lebr.
The Sigma must count on the pressure
The players didn't want to comment much after last week's Opah game.
I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.
I tried not to admit it", the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl nodded.
He left a question on Lebro's statement last week to striker Vaclav Vašiček, who did not turn Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's game.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to get on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and everybody's going to get their asses kicked, we can do it", he said.
They Taken the Warning to Heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda has not denied that preparing for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today, it was clear that they took Mr. Lebra's warning to heart.
Even though it wasn't about wanting to fight and blowing it off", said the coach.
It was like today's first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to get over the rigors and realize what the second league is all about.
That it's not just about football, but more about the fighting", said Kalvoda.
All we can do is hope that in the next few games, Sigma will be able to get it right.
"I'd love to believe that", he added.
