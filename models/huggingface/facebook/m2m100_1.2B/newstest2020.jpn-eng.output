Driving on highway is dangerous!
Young Pedal Pedal Accidents Increase (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Violation of the Road Traffic Law.
There are increasing reports of accidents caused by mismanagement, such as pedal errors, but it is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for older drivers.
According to the year-by-year pedal error incidents (Police Administration data 2015), the highest number of incidents occurred in the age of under 24 years, with 1,080 incidents, exceeding 1,032 incidents in the age of 75 years or older.
Mistakes are never too many for the elderly, but it is also important to draw attention to the younger ones.
Should I take a stitch on my feet?
Take the security?
This data does not list the ratio of men and women and the causes, but unlike the elderly people who are thought to often come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves, in the younger age class is considered to be careful about other things such as music, conversation and other mistakes, clothing, etc.
Especially women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mules and various shoes based on the day's clothes, and some drive it.
Some people find it difficult to change clothes, knowing that they are not suitable for driving, but some do not think at all about the possibilities that lead to danger, and many people are driving without embarrassment.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
The first is to "confidently manipulate the steering wheel, brakes and other operations" and Article 70 "violation of safety driving obligations", which stipulates that "you must not drive in a way that causes an accident and causes harm to people".
Furthermore, in Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the provisions laid down by the Ministry of Public Security of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality of the Municipality.
The same is the purpose of each prefecture to consider driving in "shoes that may hinder driving operation" as a violation until high heels are clearly mentioned.
Why is driving in the highway dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safe pedal operation.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the foot footer to the floor, place the foot to be vertical to the brake pedal, and when you step on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a support.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car, so that the tail does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heels are grounded on the floor is small, and because the heels have angles at the height of the heels, the area of the feet that are grounded on the pedal is also smaller and can not step tightly, making it difficult to adjust the subtleties.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but in this material the high heels are easily pulled, sometimes when the heels are pulled and the pedals can not step, or when the heels are pulled, the high heels are removed, and they are stuck in the bottom of the pedals and can not step.
In addition, there are instances where when you step in the pedal and then return it, the heels are pulled to the back of the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returning.

If the water tank is not damaged by the water pipes, the electric pump that pulls water from the water tank to each door will cease to move without electricity and so on, the water supply will not be able, and the doors will break water.

Is “beauty and ugliness” hard on paper?
What is the image of the "snakes" that overlap with the beautiful girls of your work (Magmix) - Yahoo! news
Mysterious beauty and shadowing faces?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent out to the world, and the “Horror Manga Collection”, which is known as the first person in “Horror Manga”, was launched in August 2019 with a focus on the beautiful girls painted by your teacher.
When you look at it in your hands, you notice again the correlation between “beauty” and “horror” of your work.
Is it because the shadow is attractive?
The Beautiful Girls (Five Pictures)
There was also a chapter in the preliminary chapter of the “Great Girls Collection” that said, “The horror, the ugliness, the shocking scenes and the development of the story are the opposite of her beauty, which stands out,” but the beautiful face is distorted and turns into an expression of resentment... It is because there is such a contrast that the more “horror” may stand out.
There are keywords called “snakes” in many of the works, but the serpent is perceived as a “unpleasant creature” by those who see it, and there are people who feel “beautiful” or who receive it.
Some people like reptiles, but others don’t like them.
Thus, according to the sensitivity of the person who sees it, “beauty” and “grimness” may be the “snakes” of the creatures behind the screen.
This creature is also worshipped as a creature with a higher spiritual power than in ancient times, and the house in which the “White Snake” dwells is also said to be lucky.
The story is titled “Snakes” and includes the 1965 series “Mommy is Sick!” and “Mommy’s Girl.”
It is often said that being a “shadow woman” is a beautiful woman.
If you say it in an awkward way, you can even say it as a “cool beauty” type ... ... It feels like a common point for the beautiful girls who appear in the paintings.
Among them, the main character of the "Sandy" which has been serialized in "Weekend Boys Sunday" since 1969, "Sandy" is a beautiful girl character that can be called the representative character of the paintings, but somewhere the "snakes" are associated with deep sleep every hundred years in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and parts with unusual powers.

The “children’s dining hall” that offers free or inexpensive food to children is spreading across the country.
According to a survey by NPO corporations, around 3,700 companies are active across the country this year.
Compared to 2018, the number has increased by one to six times, and there are 24 places in Fukuoka Prefecture that have increased by nine over the past year.
Why is it a children’s dining room?
The chairman of the NPO legal entity and social activist,湯浅誠, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in the city of坂井.
With the ageing of young people, the region is missing, and the shopping district is declining.
People have lost the place to meet.
“There was a need for people and communities to interact.”
In addition to the children’s dining hall, it is a “multi-generational exchange place” where the elderly also participate.
Not only will it eliminate loneliness, but it will also contribute to the support of children and the health of the elderly.
Break the chain of poverty and improve the community.
The most important thing is not to make a child out of there.
From one meal per day to several meals per day.
The scale ranges from a few people to several hundred people, and the venues vary from private houses to temples.
There is an atmosphere where people can do what they want.
That low level of accommodation is attractive.
It is only difficult to secure operating costs and staff.
You can also listen to issues such as safe management systems.
Moreover, “Values change by interacting with a lot of people” “Connecting with society becomes a secure network in the event of disasters, etc.”
It is a light of hope for a closed society.

Saudi Arabia's "true murderer" who attacked a drone oil facility (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! news
“The Iranian-made drone ‘Abbir’ used in this bombardment has dramatically improved performance in recent years by analyzing the crashed U.S. military drones.
It can be manufactured inexpensively and has a distance of approximately 1000 km.
It’s also hard to be caught by the radar because it’s flying low,” said Yokota徹, a press photographer.
On September 14, Saudi Arabia’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly thereafter, Yemen’s Houthi opposition group issued a statement.
“There is no doubt behind the Houthis that Iran is led by President Rouhani. Iran cannot allow its hostile Saudi Arabia to make money from crude oil in a situation where its country is unable to export crude oil. The aim is to inform the international community that if the crude oil embargo on Iran continues, the pain will be accompanied by it.”
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia’s entire oil production stopped and crude oil prices rose by 15 percent.
There are rumors that the oil shock is coming again.
“Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, and at least until the end of next year’s elections, he wants to avoid any military intervention in any way. As it has become clear, Iran will continue to bomb the Houthi’s undercover with drones, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever.”
The “agent war” between the United States and Iran is facing an immediate crisis.
This is the reason why YouTuber became an employee.

YouTube is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber adoption" to employ as a member of the company.
Direct Marketing Mix (hereinafter, DMMiX) is the main business of corporate customer relationship management (CRM).
What does it mean to use YouTube?
As a representative director of DmMiX, I spoke to Mr. Xiaolin Yoshida, who is also a representative of the subsidiary and staff first where YouTube was actually employed.
I want to support young people using YouTube.
What is “YouTuber adoption” at first?
小林祐樹 (hereinafter,小林): Nowadays, the profession of YouTube has become an aspiration of many young people.
Primary school students are also on the top of the career ranking they want to pursue in the future, and the number of young people who are aiming for it will continue to increase.
In the past, we have recruited and supported young people who are pursuing dreams such as bandmen and funny comedians.
Similarly, it is “YouTuber adoption” to adopt and support young people who are pursuing their dreams of becoming a YouTube user.
YouTuber has the idea that individuals are self-publishing videos, but why did you think of it?
Smalling: While many young people admire a career called YouTube, there is a reality that most YouTubers don’t earn as much as they thought.
There are not many creators who are producing and posting videos while working, or creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTube.
With this initiative, we will provide the creators who are hired with the environment for pay and content production.
Initially, we intend to support the activity by supporting the company of the benefits of the profession of YouTube, which will become an unstable position.
Environmental girl “fighting for a safe future” protests worldwide, two weeks in a row.
Greta Thunberg participated in protests in eastern Montreal, Canada.
Swedish girl Greta Thunberg, 16, who is calling for global warming, participated in a demonstration in eastern Montreal on Thursday, stressing that she will “continue to fight for a safe future.”
The youth protests of the day followed the Asian countries and took place around the world, including in Europe and the United States.
Large-scale protests in response to Greta’s appeal continued for two weeks, 20 days in a row.
She met with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau on Monday.
Trudeau, who usually appeals to his enthusiastic stance on warming, also participated in the march.
But after the visit, Greta said that Trudeau was "evidently inadequate in action."
“South Korea hopes to return to GSOMIA” U.S. Secretary of State Assistant – Yahoo! News
U.S. Secretary of State Assistant (Japan and South Korea) Napp said on November 27 in response to a single interview with the U.S. Ambassador in the U.S. Embassy's residence in Tokyo, "I hope that South Korea will rethink its decision to return" to the Japanese military intelligence protection agreement (GSOMIA), which will expire on November 23.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the re-examination of the dismantling of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is the basis for Japan, Japan, and the United States to share missile launch information.
South Korea announced in August that it would abandon the agreement with Japan, and if it ceases to apply, the framework for protecting military information in South Korea will collapse.
Mr. Napper argued that “No crisis can be effectively addressed without GSOMIA.”
“There’s time until it’s cancelled,” he urged South Korea to return.
He also stated that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the sea over Japan in July was “for the first time in history” and stated that “it is essential that the United States and South Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, work together in their alliance relations.”
The worsening relations between South Korea and Japan “would hurt the national interests of the United States.”
“There is no intention of mediation,” he said, “I will play a positive role so that Japan will be able to bury the gap.”

Hokkaido Criminal Accident, 20 Years in 30 Days Nuclear Facilities Trouble 300: Hokkaido News
From the year 2000 until the year 18 following the critical accident in Ttshu Prefecture, which caused the first deaths in the history of nuclear power in Japan, there were 336 reports of accidents and failures in nuclear power-related facilities across the country.
It’s been 20 years since the nuclear safety myth in 30 days.
The report notes that while the level 0 (not important in terms of safety) of the international assessment scale (INES) indicating the severity of the incident and about 90% of the cases outside the scope of the assessment, a continuous improvement of safety awareness is required based on the lessons of the accident and the 11th Fukushima nuclear accident in Tokyo.
The story and the original paintings of the creation painting book are completed and a donation is being raised for the publication of the book by Mr. Zhoda Fukushima, on September 18, in Fukuoka Prefecture, Fukuoka City.
Artist宗田光一 (64) in the Fukuoka Prefecture’s regional cooperation team, in order to advance the development of the painting book, launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise donations on the Internet with the aim of publishing a creative painting book derived from the legends in the Prefecture.
Hokkaido, who began his activities as a cooperative team in April this year, said: “I want to convey the heart of charity of the people of Fukuoka based on deep faith through a book.”
In order to convey the heart of Foucault.
Mr.宗田 is active as an artist working on contemporary art with mathematics as a motivation, while he has been active as a co-operative team after his retirement.
After engaging in the development of Nagano, Beagle, and Kogyo, he took over to the city in April of this year.
Kaguchi, according to the city that has developed the so-called "shaped-out", aims to create a book that has lived.
As he lived in the city, he was “surprised by the depth of compassion surrounding him for the first time.”
Attention was paid to the city’s legend “The face of the ghost of the spouse”.
In the face of the ghosts, the gentle wife continues to recite the Buddha to help the ghosts without worrying about the surprise of the face.
“Forget the hatred and return it with mercy and kindness; I felt the foundation of the faithfulness and kindness of the people of Fukuoka.”
Getting the hint, Mr.宗田 headed to the original painting book, and made interviews such as going to Yokohama City's Yokohama Sumo early on, completing the story of a hearty ghost couple and a boy's appearance.
Since June, he has lived his job and painted 10 scenes with warm watercolour paintings.
Furthermore, using the traditional crafts of the city, the cover of the book is planned to be produced in paper.
In order to read and listen, parents enjoy the opportunity to touch the paper.
For 600 publications, the target donation amount is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is until October 25.
“The heart of Fukuoka, which has been raised under the historic Buddhist culture, is proud throughout the country.
I want to communicate something about the true kindness and compassion that is passed on to children through books.”
It is one of the projects that Fukuoka Prefecture has approved 11 projects of regional activation challenged by co-operatives and within the Prefecture and supports the use of tax payments.
Fukuoka News reports information, and Fukuoka Bank is cooperating with management support.
You can donate from the crowdfunding site “Ladyfor”.

Jurgen Crop, who won the Best Director Award for "The Best", has looked back on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.
The one thing that surprised the world in many of his remarks was about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who is his biggest rival in fighting for the Premier League title.
Neymar's best friend, Aubes, says his happiness is still with Barca
After the “Best” award ceremony, the German commander said: “I had never imagined anything so great. I am very pleased and proud to have won this award. It was a wonderful few days for me.
Regarding Guardiola, Crop said, “I admire him very much,” saying, “What can I say about him? he has won many titles.The style his team plays is exceptional.He is the best director I’ve ever faced and it’s an honor to be nominated with him and to be able to fight for the prize.”
He also mentions director Pochettino and Tottenham.
“His last year was incredibly great, and in many cases it won’t be in people’s memory if he didn’t win titles.
“It’s a reversal in the match against Barcelona, many experts and I’t bet a single centimetre on us with a 3–0 bounce against the team that holds Messi and Suarez. . . . it’s like a death penalty. We could take a small chance and make it happen. I couldn’t believe it.
After receiving a personal question, Krupp concluded, “When I congratulated me on the Bundesliga championship, I woke up on a bench and didn’t even know where I was. This time it didn’t happen. I don’t like to get drunk because I’m a person afflicted by self-control compulsions. The congratulations of the CL championship went so modestly. I remember everything. If I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to distinguish everyone I saw from the bus.”

Interiors of Lexus LC.
The special specification car was developed based on the idea of “CRAFTED”.

In addition, they also specially equipped metal-processed arcade roofs and laser etching, scatter plates with beautifully emerging motifs with overlapping L, color head-up displays, and so on.
The interior features a special specification car-specific brilliant patina brown and a combination of colours for doors, leather seats and seat belts.
Furthermore, the color of the stick uses the two colors of light brown and dark brown of different brightness, combining with the striking texture, representing a superior and profound space.
The body colour is a special specification car-specific setting, starting with the rail car-specific metal, the three-color setting of sonic titanium, graphite black glass flair.
I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina will be available in October.
The exact date has not been announced, but it may be delivered on October 4.
The release date for macOS Catalina is October 4.
The above image has been posted on the Apple website in Denmark (currently revised).
It is written “from the 4th October”.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, I personally want to try the most feature in macOS Catalina is “Sidecar”.
This is a feature that treats the iPad as a sub-display for the Mac, which was traditionally implemented in third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple’s pure functionality, it is expected to be superior in completion (and responsiveness).
There are rumors that the next MacBook Pro will feature a 16-inch display, but I’d like to start by experiencing the next generation of macOS.
Sakraevi in the process of growth in Shizuoka City, such as PT, water depth of 290 meters photographed by Shizuoka News Atteses
Succeeded in shooting in the deep sea of Hokkaido Bay, this year-born Sakraevi=11th, Shizuoka City's clean water district Pura Okinawa ( "Project by Sakraevi" provided)
The Shizuoka City-based marine industry cluster council’s “Project by Bishakraevy” recently succeeded in filming the Sakraevy, which appears to have been born in the spring-summer ovulation period at a depth of 290 meters at the waterside of the Zhao River Bay.
The images of the growth process are valuable, and stakeholders want to link them to the ecological discovery of the mysterious sakura.
The photo was taken near the seabed about 1.5 km off the city's clean water area.
Over the course of 17 minutes, approximately 300 were confirmed.
In the middle of the day, the traditional knowledge that the sapphire in the deep sea “forms a certain amount of herd on the seabed” was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 millimeters in length and the individual is about 23 millimeters in length.
They identified the period of ovulation by using seasonal data of water-flooded sapphires.
Detailed analysis will be commissioned to the Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology Specialist Schools that make up the team.
The project leader of the project says, “I want to capture the live appearance of individuals in the growth process, including small cows.”

The King of the World,桃田賢斗, has a good performance!
The Men’s Singles – Bad Spy!
The Japanese team, which won six medals at the big event of badminton in August, the 25th World Championship (Switzerland, Basel), will finish the reinforcement camp in early September and participate in the China OP (State of China / Super 1000), which opens from 17th.
Here, we look back to the first half of May to August, when the Olympic race began with the Tokyo Olympics next year, and look forward to men's singles for the mid-range (September to December) (Editor / Badminton Magazine).
The badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested four top competitions (over Super 500) in which the top players appeared at the end of the world championship.
In the first half of the season, the two players who made a good performance were桃田賢斗, who won two of the four competitions, and Zhou Tianjin from Taiwan.
桃田 won the world championship, and Zhou Tianong won the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the competition where the high points of the "world ranking points" directly linked to the Olympic race can be won.
In addition, Japanese OP (S750) is also in control.
The competitions from May include the group matches of the Siddhartha Cup (May/China), the Indonesian Open (July/results are 16), the Japanese Open (July) and the World Championship (August).
Compared to other top players, the number is small, but it is a timetable that reduces the burden on the body.
As August was only one World Championship, there will be no greater fatigue than during the war.
Good results are expected in the mid-range matches that will be held in the upper assembly since September.
A strong Taiwanese assault.
Attention to young people in Thailand!
He also won the Indonesian OP and TIOP (S500) top competitions and has already participated in seven competitions.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won a remarkable victory.
At first, a strong physician, a player who does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the game, there are no big problems with the performance.
Rather, having gained high points in the first half of the match would have made it easier to adjust the schedule for the next tournament.
Until last year, Zhou Tianjin was impressed with a lack of explosive strength, but this year's entry and the increased sense of stability in the playing field allowed them to continue their good results.
For the world’s top-ranking桃田, it’s going to be a harsher opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, in the first half, the results were left by Thai younger Ace Cantaphone and Indian Sai Planis B.
Andars Antonsen, who fights as a solitary European.
Although Cantaphone is not going to the final in the top competitions, it has the strength to advance to the top, including entering the best four in the second competition this season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21 on the 18th) who has become equal to the top players, seems to have great potential for jumping in the Olympic races.
In addition, Sai Planis B. took a step out of India, where there are good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Planoi H.S. and the delayed injured Slicans Kidambi are also coming up, so the Indian forces after the mid-range need attention.
New Phone Prices Reduce Prices in Fair Competition: Hokkaido News
A new tariff plan for mobile phone companies, accompanied by the amendment to the Electrical Communications Business Act, came into effect in October.
But mostly it stopped.
Secretary-General菅義偉 said last summer that “there is room for about 40% reduction” and that, despite the increased expectations of price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the continuing oligarchy of the three major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable that a fair competition will provide an affordable pricing system.
I want the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts on terminal fees and communications fees.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fees were set to be reduced.
Softbank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to reduce the maximum cost of the terminal to half.
However, both companies will have a “SIM lock” that cannot be used by other companies’ lines for 100 days.
NTT DoCoMo will only target the contractors of its own lines with a maximum of one-third of the terminal costs.
The three companies are also continuing to engage in “circumference” to prevent shifting to other companies.
On the SIM lock, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a policy requiring immediate removal.
Companies also need to respond quickly.
The delay was due to the fact that communication networks such as base stations did not go as planned.
As long as it was expected to be an explosive of the price competition, it was a shoulder-cut suit.
Was there a sweet sight?
The start date and price of the service are not disclosed.
As a social infrastructure company, we want you to work with responsibility.
The price change was attributed to the remarks of the Chief Minister.
Mr.菅 expressed disappointment about the new tariffs of the three companies: “I think the competition will begin from now on.
However, the “official price reduction” does not seem to distort the market and promote healthy competition.
Companies should develop competition as customers before they are thrown out by the government.
The pricing system of each company is so complex that it is not easy to compare.
While the terminal is issuing advertisements such as "maximum half-cost", the Consumer Affairs has called attention as there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half-cost.
Companies themselves must try to provide polite and easy-to-understand explanations so as not to create misunderstandings by users.
Reduce the limit to 500,000 yen to three-credit cash cards within the Triple Prefecture - Isha News
Three credit coffers in Triple Prefecture (Sangnam Triple Credit Coffers, Northern Isanhoo Credit Coffers and Jingbei Credit Coffers) announced on 26th that they decided to reduce the limit of cash cards to prevent the damage of special fraud.
In the case of people over 70 years of age who have held cash cards from each credit bank of San Nino Triple, North Isan Nino, and Jingxiang, and who have never made more than a certain amount of money transactions with ATMs (cash automatic deposit machines) in the past three years, the upper limit of the amount that can be paid per day with cash cards shall be 500,000 yen.
The San-Nam Triple Credit Coin and the North Isan-Nano Credit Coin will be reduced from 1 October, while the Jinan-North Credit Coin will be reduced from 1 November.
Within the Prefecture, financial institutions and police officials have been involved in the fraud with cash cards and crypto numbers, and there are numerous special fraud cases that are funded by ATMs, and credit cashier officials say they want to “protect customers’ valuable deposits in the best possible way.”

US Athlete’s “Face Dangerous” Overland Wave “Insulting and Abominable Play” (The Answer) – Yahoo! News
U.S. F.C. Quill Raffle, former England national, "It's not what can be called a tacl"
The Rugby World Cup in Japan was held on the 26th, and the United States, which was the last to compete in 20 countries, defeated England by 7–45.
Black Star was launched, but in the latter half the raffle played by FL John Quill is calling the wave.
It is like adding a shooter to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene has also been released by overseas media with videos, and the former England national team player has also been criticized as an “insulting and inferior play” and “not something to call a taekwondo.”
“Insulting and inferior play” and overseas waves!
One-shot withdrawal, a rift between the two army players ... the actual moment of the "face-danger tackles" played by US representative Kyle
The fierce struggle crossed the line.
It was the last 29 minutes with 0-38.
Deep in the enemy, the English general Farrell somewhat broke the balance when catching his side's pass.
I went to Tucson for this.
Not from the bottom, but from the upper body, and he hit the upper body hard.
As a result, the opponent’s head and head come into contact, in a way that sounds like heading.
Farrell was heavily blown up and fell.
The obviously unjustifiable game was protested by an English player trying to kick the quilt.
The two players gathered together and became an instantaneous air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill was shot out with a red card.
Bats followed the pitch with a bad face, but in part, Boing was heard from the audience seeking fair play.
New Zealand’s local media staff headlined the Rugby World Cup 2019 with the title “Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players withdraw in bad play, England wins.”
“Kill inflicted a vile shoulder charge on the face of the English star player Farrell and dropped out,” it reports, “It was almost a fight between the two army players.”
The article introduces comments by former England national team player and commentator Hugo Mona.
“It is insulting and humiliating; it is not to be called a taekwondo; it is a humiliating play.”
The United States, which missed one in the match, lost in the 81st minute in an intentional trial.
However, Quill’s play left behind a bad taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health and Labour announced the first publication of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in the country, which found their clinical performance to be poor.
In Fukuoka Prefecture, the Ministry of Labor verified the treatment performance of public and public hospitals 14 facilities, and 4 facilities of the National Hospital Organization of the City of Fukuoka Hospital ▽坂井 Municipal Three-country Hospital ▽越前町's Tezada Hospital ▽ 高浜町's若狭高浜 Hospital - were targeted.
The four hospitals are crazy.
In order to curb the expansion of medical expenses due to aging, we took an extraordinary step to address the need to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will also ask the target hospitals for a thorough consideration of the reorganization and integration, and we will make a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force, but local leaders and residents are expected to react in fear of the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
announced at the meeting of the same day.
The targeted hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, with many hospitals with relatively few beds.
According to the prefectures, the proportions were higher in order of the provinces of Nizhny Novgorod (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Hokkaido (47.5%), Hokkaido (46.7%), and Okawa (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, while Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from 2017, the Ministry of Labor surveyed 1,455 hospitals in public and public hospitals capable of responding to the “high-acute period” for severe patients and the “acute period” for general surgeries.
They analyzed clinical results for nine items, such as cancer and emergency care, and whether competing hospitals were "within 20 minutes by car" and assessed the need for the publication of hospital names.
The targeted hospitals will be asked to consider abolishing or moving some clinical departments to other hospitals.
Healthcare expenses will rise dramatically in the 25 years when the entire group generation is over 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labour has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 124,6 thousand beds (18 years) to 119,1 thousand.
At present, there is a large number of beds for “high-acute” and “acute” periods, where nurses are well-placed and cost medical care, while there is a shortage of high-need rehabilitation for the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, we need not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number for rehabilitation.
Around the reorganization and integration of hospitals, a “regional medical concept” was formulated by each prefecture to determine the number of beds needed in 25 years.
While the country is divided into 339 districts and is being consulted by local authorities and medical officials, many local residents and heads of state haveined a cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Heavy Labour wants to activate the debate by publishing the names of poor-performing hospitals.

Swine cholera vaccine recommended areas 9 Prefectures Agriculture (岐阜新聞Web ) - Yahoo! News
On Thursday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Aquaculture issued a revision of the preventive vaccination guidelines to allow preventive vaccination of non-recognized pigs in order to prevent the spread of the infection with the animal infectious disease swine cholera.
The target area will select nine counties, including岐阜 and愛知 prefectures, where infection with pigs and wild mammals has been confirmed.
Movements of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs will be restricted within the territory, but distribution of raw meat and processed products will be allowed outside the territory.
After public comments to the general public, the procedure will be completed as soon as possible in mid-October.
With the use of vaccines and the approval of domestic and foreign circulation of raw meat, it will no longer be a “cleansing country” that has been recognized by international organizations and could affect the export of pork.
Since September last year, Japan has been temporarily in a state of reservation for the status of a cleansing country.
In the amendment, on the basis of expert opinions on areas with high risk of infection from wild pigs to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture has set up a “vaccination recommendation area”.
The targeted prefectures will set up a “vaccination program” gathering the scope and time of vaccination, the number of heads, and how to proceed, and will be approved by the governor after confirmation by the ministry.
The other seven prefectures listed as recommended regions for vaccination are Saitama, Fukuoka, Ishikawa, Fukuoka, Nagano, Triple and滋賀.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review and re-decide the situation.
Movements of vaccinated pigs, sperm, fertilized eggs, bodies, and excretions are, in principle, restricted within the territory.
Meat and processed products shall not be subject to the cost of circulation restrictions or the impact on farmers, and will tolerate circulation outside the territory in fact.
Treat food waste thoroughly to prevent the spread of the virus.
We will also advocate for the safety of vaccinated pigs and work to prevent reputational damage.
The amendments to the guidelines were summarized at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the prevention and prevention headquarters.
In the future, consultations and public comments will be conducted to the prefectures until October 7 and the new prevention guidelines will be implemented.
Non-owned Honda Gui佑, open approach to ManU!
“Please make an offer. no money needed” (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Saturday) 2:57 Delivery
Last season only withdrew from the Australian A-League Melbourne Victory, and the current non-member former Japanese representative MF Honda Guizhou took a surprising move.
Did you actually go to the match?
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda updated its own Twitter tweet at midnight on 27 July, saying, “Please make an offer, you don’t need money, but you need to play with a great team or a great teammate.”
The opponent who sent the “reverse offer” was the world-renowned Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a huge request for a high-profile Premier League club?
The story is based on an Australian edition of Fox Sports published on the 24th.
In the article entitled “Five FWs that Manchester United could possibly catch in the crisis of continued injury,” five unrelated players that are currently available to win were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, there were also Honda names.
Currently, there are continued injuries in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bayley, FW Anthony Marshall and FW Marcus Rushford, who are in an emergency situation.
“The Red Devil” led by Ore Gunner Sulshar is forced to win two victories and 22 defeats in the league battle, and has challenges to the quality of the front.
That’s why it was Honda that was named as a new force candidate for the Japanese media.
In the article it is analyzed that “Honda’s contract as a creative side player, not a striker, strictly speaking, can fill the hole that Andreas Pelleyra has filled.”
Nine points in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are “a solid record,” but “33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team and get full attention.”
Does Honda’s approach work?
It is also interesting to see if United will move out for the veterans who say their goal at the Tokyo Olympics next year.
500 mobile translators have been installed for free borrowing from Shizuoka news agencies, shops and other offices.
The mobile translator "Poketok" is borrowed free of charge from 500 stores and other stores in the city.
The Hamsun Commercial and Industrial Council announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 stores in Hamsun City in the business of lending a portable translator "Poketok" to its members.
The intensive deployment of the translator in the same region is likely to be the first in the country, and it will lead to improved inbound (visiting Japanese travelers) response.
There are 236 dining stores, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city’s central district accounts for 6 percent.
The map app “Google Maps” also started to show where to borrow, so that you could see where “foreign-language stores” are located on a smartphone.
It can be accessed from the beach tourist site.
The free lending of Poketok in 74 languages began in April following the declaration of “Japan’s first invading support city,浜松” by nine organizations in the city.
The company purchased 500 units and borrowed them for two years to small and medium-sized enterprises that fulfilled the conditions for hosting certification and cash-free payment.
A representative of the Chamber of Commerce said: “I would like to connect it with the opening up of new foreign customers in a tough business environment.”
Do you not want to go straight away from the Ivory Mountain, even if you want to go straight away?
Today’s best shot.
A 1W shot is not necessarily tipped up and hit.
There is also a technique called "Direct Draw" when you want to hit the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance, such as the second strike of Par 5.
Recent 1W has a large head volume and the risk of spreading the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the tiger round.
The first victory in the tour is awaited by Pyeongchang.
The professional seventh 24-year-old is 166cm tall and smaller, while currently ranked seventh in the driving distance sector (average 304.02yd).
While proficient in long shots, one of the challenges was fairwood accuracy.
Earlier in the spring, "Spoon (3W) shot was not good, so I thought I would try a straight drop."
From the exercise round, you can drop the ball with the pottery on the grass of the tiery, and throw 1W away as a result.
In cases where big carries are required, the tipping is used more often, but both sides are effectively utilizing straight doors, such as narrow halls.
“It can be used as a hall where the eyes are turned down.”
The ballistic meters recorded from 270yd to 280yd.
“So I don’t need 3W. Caddy can be safer with a direct drawer than 3W.”
Since the Japan Tour Championship in June, there has been only 1W of wood in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the 17-degree loft.
The warfare, which is also surprised by tour companions, is pleased to hear the admiration leaked from the gallery.
The goal is to “take the club to the level.”
“I can’t fly straight, even if I hit up and down, I’m going right in the cut orbit. I was initially doing a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tapping). This exercise will also slow down the attack angle (the club’s entry angle).”
The ball is not caught, and there is a risk of cracks, but "so the left side can be wiped out (do not turn to the left)."
In Canada, I think it’s a professional.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is being listened to, there are messages that insult Mrs. Greta.
Greta Thunbury: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political critics said Greta was “mentally ill, being exploited by her parents and the international left,” and the television station apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on the part that is not the contents of Greta’s remarks, such as “I think she’s used and poor” and “I’m better going to school.”
In a tweet on September 26, Greta wrote, “Why do adults spend their time laughing at and threatening teenagers and children?”
I think of as many lies and conspiracy theories as I can.
Gretta said, “Look, it started again.As you can see, people who hate me are always as active. My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I’m different from people, they’re chasing around, they’re coming up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think.”
And the adults pointed out that they may seem to be diverting from the point of talk because they don’t want to face the climate and environmental crises.
I honestly don’t understand why adults spend their time laughing at and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do something good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don’t waste your time paying more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Change is coming.
Adults like change, even if they don’t.
See you on the streets on Friday!

On the 22nd, the final round was held at South Korea's Bear's Best Cheongna Golf Club (7238 yards per 71), where Staromo Landy ran with 1 Eagle, 2 Bardi, 1 Boogie's "68" and finished the competition with a total of 9 and 5 alone.
We are coming to Japan!
Shots of Garcia.
It was extended to the first half, so I thought I could go with the momentum in the latter half, but because the patter could not be extended quite well, it was regrettable.
Did you see the 6th Eagle and 7th Bardi winning?
After hitting Boggie at number 4, there was also a par 5 left, so if I did with the feeling of recovering, a chip in Eagle came to me at number 6.
In the seventh place, Bardi had a chance to win, but it was a pity that he could not extend in the end.
Have you ever won at the conference?
Recently (shooting) was not going well, so it was good that Fairway was able to stick tightly along the narrow course.
Raff was also in turn and the opposite eye broke apart and the strike and the distance changed, so there was not much (experience) so I studied a lot.
What’s different from the usual meeting?
It was possible to have a camera shot.
I didn’t care at all, but a lot of galleries were making videos.
Other than that, there was not much that changed, but because there were only a few Japanese players in the competition, I came to the match with the feeling that "I can't lose to overseas players."
The latter half will continue from now on, but if you don’t win more than one win, you don’t want to target the prize king, so I want to win another one win, and in the near future there is also the ZOZO championship, so I will strive to get the top position and qualify for the competition.
How to prevent dementia and stay “forgotten”?
The Sun / The Sun / The Sun / The Sun
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are challenging research and development because of frustrating drugs for dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being clarified, and we have discovered that it is possible to keep it extremely mild and forgetful.
I spoke to the University Hospital Center for Brain Accidents Professor Junkyuk.
Dementia will not disappear.
– Prevention or treatment of dementia is expected, but what is the current situation?
From mild to severe, no matter the degree, everyone can develop dementia as they get older.
However, it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years to develop a new dementia drug.
Donepezil, a medication that is widely used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some countries abroad, so you can’t expect a marked outcome.
Meanwhile, while infectious and accidental deaths have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to dramatic advances in anti-cancer and other treatments, people have been able to live longer.
It is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is necessary not to solve the problem alone, but to create an environment in which the community as a whole can live safely.
How to keep things forgotten.
Are there people who have difficulty becoming dementia?
Although becoming dementia is inevitable, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to the “forgotten” level.
Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and people tend to become more prone to it.
First, people with metabo are prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle habits.
A combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol hemorrhoids.
There is no impact on economic power.
For example, there are areas in the United States where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets include frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken.
It can not use gas or electricity, and can be used by people who live in an environment where they can not cook.
Then you will eat less vegetables and protein, and you will become a fat and sugar-pregnant life.
Eventually, in poverty but becoming obese, what to do is just to watch TV, and the body becomes unhappy.
A similar situation is possible in Japan.
People who don’t think about things and don’t work tend to get dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you don’t have to be a metaphor, you need to read books every day and think about things.
