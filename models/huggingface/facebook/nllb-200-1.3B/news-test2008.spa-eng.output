European inflation slipped into food
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the rapid rise in food prices.
Price increases in November were higher than expected in all 13 euro area countries, with annual inflation of 3.1% after 2.6% in October, the Luxembourg-based Statistical Office of the European Union announced.
Official forecasts only gave a 3 percent chance - Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, did not cut the basic interest rate on the pretext that the fall, together with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation in Germany, at 3.3%, broke the 12-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6% to 4.1%.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of skyrocketing food and energy prices.
The rate of interest on wheat rose by 88%, and the rate on soybeans reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more was paid for vegetable oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from the current 2.1% in 2008 to 2.5% in 2009, but will decline to 1.9% by 2009.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain at around 3 percent over the next 3 or 4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats had risen significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's confident voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two thirds (71%) versus support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seats: their support among the entire population is two percent.
Among the confident voters there is one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been higher, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the economic situation of the country especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
As for the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate and only one tenth expect an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those questioned, the highest figure in any previous Gallup survey, felt that the Prime Minister was performing poorly rather than well.
13 percent of those questioned trust or have a high level of trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those questioned.
54% of the population have no confidence in the Prime Minister and 27% do not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced in the face of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 per cent felt it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Prime Minister in power, this proportion is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 per cent of those questioned about participation said they would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said they were likely to participate.
In comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would be certain to participate and another 15 percent believe their participation likely.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of tuition fees, 79 percent of the payment of medical consultations and 84 percent of the payment of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of 16 per cent was maintained by the hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, with the difference that VAT was not increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year, the average price of the Napi newspaper's Christmas basket rose by 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, but all hypermarkets saw growth well above HUF 1,000.
As in December last year the prices in food supermarkets had already "raised", there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could buy last year for well under 9 000 HUF, they cannot buy today for even 10 000.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest basket value was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in the price of turkey breast fillet, nutmeg and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistics Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola in a two-litre redeemable bottle was less than HUF 200, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
But in Napi Auchan's basket, it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18% the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
Last year the average price increase was HUF 1206, so that during last year's Christmas the VAT increase was felt in prices.
It was this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price range to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of a product's circulation poorly, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that is adjusted to the sales volume.)
The price increase of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the VAT increase that the most expensive basket was HUF 1720 higher than the value recorded in 2006, while the difference in the cheapest basket was only HUF 844.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was recorded in less than 20 months, with hypermarkets seeing more than a 30 percent increase in the price of basic consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: for some basic foodstuffs, the latter recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12 months.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, because the price of this product, which was quite expensive last year compared to the base, recorded, in the worst case, barely a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can force price increases on even multinationals.
Hypermarkets don't complain about the golden triangle of commerce, they constantly talk about positive results.
In our experience, most of the consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all the produce, taking the preserved food with them by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed in all three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of appliances.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, primarily due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favour the control of infections - says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are economical.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
A man hospitalized after a serious accident was found to have the antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred at this same hospital earlier this year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from hospital and the same patient had to return to hospital shortly afterwards as a result of MRSA infection and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, 1094 cases of hospital infection by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents, the rest is unknown.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i. e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of humans carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once antibiotics are over- or unduly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic-resistant and quickly become contagious in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, e.g. wound infections or sepsis, first to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with weakened organism, to the elderly or to people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff attends them in rubber gloves and mask and there are adequate antibiotics for their treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients in hospital are examined for MRSA in advance, but even this cannot prevent infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples.
In most cases, it would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections, but the current national hospital circumstances are not conducive to preventing the formation and infection of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine inpatients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not a trend in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are visible in the patient - said the chief medical officer of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict guidelines for the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for the treatment of infections and diseases.
The aim is to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, that microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
You save money with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks are therefore very important, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent epidemics, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation, disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher probability of infection.
Karolina Böröcz believes that where adequate prevention measures are in place, fewer such infections are recorded or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Governmental programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in every country it is fought.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections are showing a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has as one of its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
The possibility of the drunk driving or in a state of stupor of the then-resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday hit and killed a passenger, can be excluded - said Attila Morvai, spokesman of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol check which had already found that the former police commander did not consume any alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then-head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning to the street Kossuth Lajos of the XXII district ran over a man of 55 years, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians.
(This latter fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the road, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning cooperated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance infrastructure for education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects from the Hungarian budget, which will be carried out from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a loan agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary. The decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken later, when the loan agreement is extended.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovation and research project at the University of Debrecen.
The talks also covered the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalised the details of the financing of the Metro with the EU, they would re-examine whether or not it was necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an eight-year grace period, without charging a commission for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate haven of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards this Balkan country, which was mentioned a little earlier.
What, where and who are buying in the even cheaper EU market, which will be getting more expensive quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski-track apartments and beach villas.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract real estate developers and more and more people will buy property in the especially cheap part of Rus.
The capital Sofia will also be attractive, with commercial and office spaces promising a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing destinations in Europe, being a prime destination during the other two seasons as well as summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
Analysts say that those who buy property in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Re/Max regional director in Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and they also want to be close to a big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is comprised of chalet buyers (Bulgaria was in the top 10 holiday destinations for Germans in December).
The third group is made up of real estate investors who make purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly rising, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, over the last five years they have increased by 21 per cent annually.
The increase in real estate prices considerably exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the level of experts will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap for efforts after the Kyoto Protocol emissions reduction period, which runs until 2012.
There are lively discussions on the particular between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures, although it is likely to agree that, compared with 1990, emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent by 2020.
Another major issue of the conference is whether or not the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels, whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" is signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even by 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatory to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a 5.2 per cent reduction, within which the then 15 EU Member States committed to an 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet - says the press release from the Ministry of Environment.
The international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed in two years' time, because if it is not, its entry into force will be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN that deals with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C in the average temperature of the earth could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units on a video distribution site post footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special Forces deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled at the General Operations Corps in Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Already 139 recordings from air force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the British Commonwealth Office and the Multinational Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present the public with the true purpose of the British military presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - but inevitably has some political message, since it justifies the rationale for military actions decided by the government in a specific way.
The Americans have prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the recordings that have been circumspectly edited and censored, the distributor also features amateur videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers talk about losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos of actual operations have been uploaded from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British Army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way for recruitment with the free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tomb and salt cake at the ministries Christmas party
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, does not seem to be feeling too sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty pastries and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power is diverted.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for the Ministry's employees.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of soldiers currently serving abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a lavish party in respect of the holidays of the other portfolios.
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and of the six hundred workers of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected to attend.
The party will be held in a Christmas atmosphere, with artists and a raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a company which manages tenders called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development with Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
You can attend without a suit.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge them anything for the use of their premises.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting words and after dinner there was live dance music.
In response to [origo's] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a costume or evening gown.
Health, labour and local government portfolios are being prepared for a modest celebration.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its employees in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is waiting for her colleagues not for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
The press department said that 180 guests will be present, who will only drink coffee and salted pastry, so the party will cost no more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own conference hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
The official nature of the event will be given not only by the ministerial address but also by the evening schedule of the celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20th, at the Ministry there will be no Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only the specialized diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
The press department of the Environmental Portfolio was unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day of the final vote on the public health law - the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike, which they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be formed to coordinate the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike for an indefinite period, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not inform about the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike action.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on in the late hours of the night, or at best close to midnight.
The strike on Monday will lead to significant difficulties in transport: the railways will be closed indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may be shut down in the morning and more than half of Volán's buses will be shut down.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's Web page.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a definite period.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railroad and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, the Airports of Budapest from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a strike of four hours the Unions of LIGA of the Electrical Industry and of Thermal Energy, the Unions of the Educators called a strike of 2 and the Democratic Syndicate of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will go on a national strike at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that the new way of calculating pensions should be introduced gradually, which will come into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions, the occupations which deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and are waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was set up in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has in various ways increased the political risk to Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" states that the greatest political risk in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity is the fact that "with the worsening of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably to provoke an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They said that this was one of the main faults of the Hungarian political leaders: "the public leaders gave up the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, impedes normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006 the reorganisation of the radical and extreme right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organisations have been formed in the country which define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State" - they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method which tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a list of the Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention.
The analysis shows that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighboring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions similarly to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: 'This initiative has sparked a lively debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will form their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - as can be seen in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The director of research at Political Capital, Attila Juhász, responded to the news agency's question by stating: "Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party isn't always written in red numbers.
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days that are written in red numbers in the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, the holidays are not uniform.
Hungarian laws distinguish between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The holiday period is mainly associated with religious and historical holidays.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are festive - the latter especially so that those who spent time celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and on October 23, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the holiday of work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, in our country there are two days of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so often a bridge is made when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the longer weekends, you cannot miss work or school on the Saturdays before.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day immediately before or after the holiday.
This legal rule is binding on all employers and their employees, as well as on employees and civil servants.
However, it is not compulsory for enterprises and service institutions which, because of their function, work uninterruptedly even during public holidays.
This year the work order can only be altered around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in the country is practically stopped, since according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid-week or weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be changed around the Labour Day so that workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the 23 October holiday: on Saturday 18 October, instead of Friday 24, you will have to work.
However, next year during the New Year's holiday, you can rest, since from December 24 onwards you will not work in almost any place, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails we forget to send, text messages we never receive, innocent lies we pass on without realizing it: they are all part of our daily workplace folklore.
You have to decide whether you will adapt to the little annoyances or consciously avoid the confusing situations that may irritate others.
- I'm going to take advice.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been called from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues".
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, he feels sorry and tries to fix the matter, at best he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less usual solution).
Most of the time, the issue is resolved by an apology.
Before you go on to make a mocking explanation, it is worthwhile to meditate on the things you can do to make your colleagues' lives bitter and to make a conscious effort to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to grab a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find them.
Do you remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it was gone?
Do you find your pen lost on one of your colleagues' desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking, for they will rightly be angry with you for taking their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There's no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Do not abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury what you have heard in yourself and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know things about him.
You're taking unjustified sick leave?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and have an unbearable headache, you feel bad or you feel that you would rather rest that day; think that others must do your work, your unfinished tasks, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that you will not be in the office the next day or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, tell them so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Screams, laughs, phone calls
You're in your job, but you're suddenly taken off by the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally overheard a telephone conversation that you would have been better off not to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues with your murmurs, songs, loud conversations (less when you do them above their head), patting, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if you're not currently delving into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
You don't mean the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must make amends!
Ask how you can make up for your lack!
Do you feel too at home at the office?
Jogging and slippers: a very comfortable habit for the home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to live up to the public's expectations.
The car is moving slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
There's a strange beat on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going to turn it up.
He changes the rhythm of the music and the bass is added to the previous notes and then the voice of a female choir like a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music scene didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it feels totally different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are slowly changing the image and although garage-style rock is again in fashion, breaking guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the European Parliament.
The wider public got to know the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell also in Western markets.
There's no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they're comfortable wearing this label.
The band reacted as they should: they prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Well, this title was one of the lines in the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to airy, to flight, is good, but in addition to the airy of music, now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit from the channel mr2 Petõfi which lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Well, everything is in order.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer about the project.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what you are playing, to what extent is it music dedicated to a select audience?
Balazs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two kinds of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called alternative underground music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally for sale only, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has a larger tradition.
Not only the fifteen- and twenty-year-olds attend concerts there, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are happening around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they're from, and how many people listen to your music?
BZ: Naturally, I feel good about seeing more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we've never written music for the market.
We don't compose music for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to live up to the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a solo artist and made his career rather west of us.
BZ: We don't follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We're more of a team, trusting each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In the list of mr2 hits Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
ZsB: We didn't intend to write great hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the record, trying to relax after the orgy of the sound and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why them - what was the main reason?
BZ: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
So the idea came to create this choir of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - that is Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who were later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
ZsB: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the record, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
That night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came about on the first try and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are in the background.
On purpose?
BZ: They're in the bottom simply because of technical problems.
We did not want to give out solo roles.
The song also talks about that, about forgetting our ego for a while, about who's where we come from and where we're going, and letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel the same euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work on the most?
ZsB: In the musical composition, actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove didn't want to work and then, little by little, everything just sort of came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
ZsB: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "sold" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
That is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, which also owns the Czech Commercial Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good abilities.
He sensed a long time ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character", he let his superiors hear, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's answers, as reported by French media such as Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros from his business ventures.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank", he says in his answers.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity you saw coming earlier this year.
In February, some news began to come out about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had had problems with payments in the past and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis was not to affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe him and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I earned my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify", Kerviel confesses, adding that he has left nothing for himself at all.
During the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not possible.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange started to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned to profit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
No, not really.
"I thought I'd made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, they'd be happy".
Where did you get the willpower to take that risk?
In my position, work was to be done gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was running between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never make as much as the others.
"I noticed that people were looking at me with caution when I first interviewed them in 2005.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress", Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after I joined the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the London bombings, a downside play of 500 million euros.
And this was a kick-start mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you go.
"This is like a snowball", the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew of all this or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes".
Only, then, the coup came earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no holiday is a runner who does not want anyone to look at his file", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the potential to achieve €365 billion in
The Czech Government Ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will provide some 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure which next year will have the amount of 90.800 million crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme should serve entrepreneurs and enterprises to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the newest countries to use EU funds less than the EU.
Twenty years for former Nicaraguan president, court decrees
The Court of Appeals in Nicaragua on Thursday handed down a 20-year sentence to former president Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (nearly 1.800 million crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go under house arrest at his hacienda not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is unclear at this time, according to the AP, whether the then Central American head of state between 1197 and 2002 will be back in prison.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the penitentiary agents whether they let Alemán finish his sentence at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved how German was constantly transferring government money to a company account in Panama.
This partnership was fictitious and the account belonged, in reality, to his closest family members and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán set up to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly passed the new law.
It's such a paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and every budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore receives special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than just numbers.
The State budgets of the last Social Democrats governments suffered from three defects which cannot be so easily solved for this year:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as spending of the officials which are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit in public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
The greatest risk, however, is not the deficit in the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The ticking time bomb, however, is the deficit in the municipal and Community budgets.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, besides tax money, fees and bank credits, often issued senseless bonds with which they indebted their councils disproportionately.
In recent years they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatisation.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through growth phases for some years now, just like the rest of the world, as ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state's finances in order.
However, instead the state continued to borrow.
The other countries, with the exception of a few, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more economically sound than our Republic.
It is a great shame, especially for the previous government.
We belong to the nations that are the least threatened by poverty by global measures.
That is why we do not need massive social programmes which have unfortunately been unnecessarily inflated by gigantic measures in recent years.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform are not changed soon then it will be the end of really any politics in this country and, whoever rules will be a mere bureaucracy.
I am not going to go into detail here, but I am going to go into detail here.
So this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on the spending of the presidents.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the previous government had not squandered what they could over the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become just civil servants so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make it possible to achieve a balanced State budget gradually.
The following is a list of the names of the persons:
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The monetary market will receive more than 100 billion dollars through tenders.
In these auctions the banks auction off the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send out a bid of 40 billion dollars, and then another 24 billion dollars will be provided by the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continuing growth of the scarcity of free capital that banks could lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group in his report for clients.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what is still ahead when they decided to take this step", said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the housing market in the USA.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism came now with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference, which creates a strange mix of government and non-governmental representatives, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality, was unacceptable.
"There, the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, during the presentation of his book, stressed that this subject is very important to him and that he is therefore interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often only find the caricature of my ideas".
Now interested parties can ask for their opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the key moment of the closure he expressed his opinion that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence climate development are futile, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Furthermore, as a man who has experienced totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was not against "reasonable environmentalists but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same subject was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people didn't get to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving licence which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for the change so officials give them until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid carnet.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in towns they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the metropolis offices are full of applications and interest in the new card has increased.
City Hall estimates about 2,000 customers a day.
The queues are for half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet obtained their new driving licence.
The issuing of a new card takes 20 days.
However, you can apply for a card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their pass and do not arrive until the end of the year, but will be on the roads without the valid pass, will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infraction with a warning.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine is 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of one thousand crowns, at most.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of 1,000 crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the ID that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive should turn in their driver's license.
Just bring it in or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the passports issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licence.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentences of Berdych's accomplices.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided that the sentences, the first one year and the second two years, should be reduced to a final term.
Detectives from the Prague anti-organized crime department were initially to be sentenced to 14 to 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by the revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance first.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years in other trials.
He can't take any more.
In January, the district court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the high court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' allegations were dismissed by the investigation as fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, the police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped the members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals handed 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment concerns criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the robbery, his victims suffered serious health impacts but they are also accused of abuse of power as public officials and without permits to carry weapons.
In the home search, the police found a few pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser guide and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men connected to Berdych's case are still testifying in other trials, and in some cases they haven't yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland awaiting a final decision on their surrender to the Czech authorities.
One account to change a few kids: 12 million
For changing some children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the Třebič hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We do not approve such a demand, it is too high", Dostál said after the meeting today.
"To get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We are of the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostál stressed.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň's family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only it was drawn up at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The girls' parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered psychological impact and stress of varying levels and depth.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men although they fought with recriminations over the girls' change.
Women are taking it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by the nurses at the Třebič maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákové in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablón.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October as compensation for the error committed at the Třebič hospital that the region manages.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against damage.
In the event of errors, they must draw from the reserve fund and, exceptionally, they can ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far awarded them a relatively low compensation, the sums of which were calculated according to tables that count in the hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia trademark.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the hearing today.
According to your attorney, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone thinks of him as an actor and comedian.
Harabiš has the same idea.
"We have about ten years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities", he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something for it.
They want to live as parasites of our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Wallachia trademark was first used by Polívka in her television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it wasn't about guiding him towards creating a fictional kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš had the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered her holders discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees at her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia", the judge said.
He added that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, derived from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already being prepared Harabiš.
From him should come the new king.
He has not yet revealed any further data or dates.
"We are in no hurry.
It's got to be something like the King's Way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can come forward", Harabiš said.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome and the Commission's decision to withdraw from the agreement
To tell you the truth, I've never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer at two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It's an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate more design invention here, although the car already looks pretty fancy.
The seats are comfortable, there goes the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral steering has been considerably improved.
And the space, and here you can feel how the dimensions of the body have grown.
The Combi eliminates the aforementioned lack of space in the header.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This one I must rate as very accessible (thanks to the folding back door) and well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps which are an ideal solution.
They are not annoying, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the depot.
According to the tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres in basic mode, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation model from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its noticeable 52 litres.
On holiday abroad or when placing the baby's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor which remains quite flat after the second line backs are knocked down.
120 horses in four sets
Our test car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 liters and a force of 88 kW.
And that's actually what a 1600 should look like if it belittles the familiar five-door.
It's quiet, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the Škoda era of then, when it looked as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices are responding
The price of the car is not for everyone.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it at 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags in the headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it's 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the add-ons from the team at the Fabia and you'll come up with a pretty similar number.
Now it's just a matter of deciding which brand.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
Children from Eastern Europe attend English schools, and so the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for the time being brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrant and native children escalate into violence.
The problem of the integration of East European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between the native and the Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Arguing, extortion and quarrels between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gotten so bad that the police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense he said the girl was insulting his son with racist-sounding insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls showered him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"As we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told her to stop, she threw apples and pears at us, and then she pulled down her pants and showed us her butt", the mother of the Slovak student described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One native even called the conflict with Eastern European migrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools is becoming quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
The whole thing is packed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean island you can find all of this and much more.
Only on one island does he find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and cargo port for the treasures the Spaniards extracted from America and carried to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba like drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In Havana, tall buildings were built, and cars were used as a symbol of worship in the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel, they mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars, which were already cult cars in the '50s, are still running in Havana today, because those Lada and Fiat cars that came a long time ago have rusted in these damp, salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating, there are no such wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area.
Other places are transformed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from the vast plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their carriages for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The place most familiar to most visitors doesn't change.
And so, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation growing in rocky limestone lands.
The valley falls are made of mud, limestone pillars and steep cliffs, and their caves acclimate to fertile soil, forming rocky outcrops that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories may help you find the finished product.
It might be interesting to someone that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
The Trinity
Old abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that as late as the 1950's there was no road connecting it to the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time than one afternoon to be in Trinidad, it is worthwhile to visit interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the morning.
Other
A small town on the western tip of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
I am sure that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads leading there from Guantanamo must pass through high, broken mountains, as well as nature that barely knows man's action.
This eastern part of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its pristine nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santería, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of this could fill many pages.
However, as they say, you better see it sometime.
The Allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment is what is affecting the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, representatives of the countries with troops in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as the conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to be more active, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own", Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to the US military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of them in the south.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They're exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we're going to achieve them", Gates said.
The Commission has also made a number of recommendations to the Council.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The debate among the countries attending in recent months has been over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized as a liability.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are playing while our boys are fighting", Sun wrote in a piece accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph of the British troops playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach one trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement of the state budget's economic development.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt for early October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year the State borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the billion-krona border by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900,000 million and one billion crowns", said the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, for the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimir Pikora said: "We could pass the trillion mark in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see any such change", he added.
The doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The State debt is paid for by means of Treasury bonds, State bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt has now risen from 1.700 billion to 123.300 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion crowns and since June it has been reduced by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mostly by bonds where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a reform of the pensions" commented Pikora.
Better than expected
The strategy for payments and debt management for 2007 shows that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement in the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the deficit in the state budget which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.300 million crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency of some SEK 13.3 billion, the provision of SEK 10 billion for pension payments, SEK 43 billion for financing state obligations and SEK 1.8 billion for payments on loans from the European Investment Bank.
I was comparing Khartoum to a court today for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students of 6 to 7 years old name a teddy bear after Muhammad when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable to a penalty of flogging.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher from Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, ages 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name", which he said was just an "innocent mistake".
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students " and "never talking about religion in class"..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, having failed to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the status", European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitment to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period", he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was given a new mandate by the UN last August.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West considers independence under European Union supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached", announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where the "last-chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, has expressed some of his grief.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations".
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has for his part considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a 'domino effect' in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia", he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its ally Russia has a veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia", declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: at the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu had told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in concert" with the West.
Bush starts a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference convened by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides' obligations to the roadmap for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues".
This designation covers the three main acute issues of the Israeli-Palestinian point of contention: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and address all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among other things".
On his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the forthcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" coexisting Palestinian and Israeli.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
The Arab states, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, are at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saoud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As with every such event, official accounts and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, rue Luisa-Miguel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but in patrol, and he was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse", a police source explains.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "not homologated, i.e. not authorized to travel on public roads" (see below) and driven by two young men without helmets, was traveling "at full throttle".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a violation of the right-hand lane", the police say.
The alcohol controls performed on the occupants of the vehicle were negative.
The condition of the car (the front part unturned, windshields cracked, bumpers torn) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into "facts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance" to the IGPN, which is linked to the departmental directorate of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this mini-bike came relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a kind of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been embedded in time for the police car to come to a stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical examination.
Both victims' bodies were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young men.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also dismiss "any serious misconduct" concerning this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, on which we have to be very prudent", a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these a few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks precisely at the scene.
"We went down immediately with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them", this witness says.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw "a cop completely terrified, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was on the phone".
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police departed".
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The fire department came right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the imposition of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures have been injured by tear gas grenades fired by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers shot and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday picked up the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swore before Musharraf".
" The promise of Musharraf no longer holds "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referring to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He was to rule in the next few days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf to the presidency on 6 October, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings", the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer matters" after the state of emergency, he told Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to drop his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Population Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile pill still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalisation of contraception, however, allowed for better "fertility dominance", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less per month for one couple out of five and if possible for spring, the season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair over the space station
It must have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crewmembers on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is essential to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky venture that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapped" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a cylindrical thick piece that will soon house European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5 ton solar power module, already on the ISS, to its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began rearranging the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, has been damaged by a little over a meter or so by a cable that got snapped.
The deployment has been stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were initially supposed to make a control exit of the shuttle Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to go to the end of the 30-meter-long remote-control arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, tough, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After inspecting the damage precisely, he cut the fallout cable and installed "tablets" of sorts in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts like Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "swept away" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the shuttle Discovery for the scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS securities are listed on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently in a sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aerospace and defence group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with delays on the A400M.
EADS is losing 4% at 21.96 euros currently to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast for the operating result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new targets for operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further precision in figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operating result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, the very heavy aircraft carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise Sunday, at the polls: Russians will vote massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses voters with a televised message on public broadcasting networks, already recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, content to hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents", he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He's denouncing a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says that there have been "never such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unexpected legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will prevail.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel ownership of their destiny", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further back: civil society in this Christianized country was behind Europe by five centuries; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disengagement", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "renounce voluntarily personal responsibility" for those who had briefly tested after the breakup of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion is for stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely available.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available until now only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his right holders.
The 11 states that administer them - Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective from yesterday.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to search "particularly for the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these nomination documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
So is the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of certain deportation victims.
The records of concentration camps or of Gestapo arrest warrants had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants who had been deported or subjected to forced labour and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, over 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are processing tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to a part of the scientific community.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents", Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin, had stated in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement by 2008
At present, the Indo-European bilateral trade already amounts to about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
The European Union's foreign ministers gave their approval last April for the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly dop both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten goods exported by India, the European Commissioner said.The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, who felt that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".The European Union and India are meeting on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turn of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a £10 billion offer at the 5.75 percent base rate in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market so on December 6 at 12h15 GMT, to the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time the Bank of England has put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "prepared to take further steps to keep the" interbank lending indices up to date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month index was 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the start of the financial crisis last summer, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a large penalty rate which had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties refuse to examine the proposals of the PS party on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
The text, which was set in a socialist niche (a session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), listed a dozen measures adopted by the PS national office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the surplus for employment, the reinstatement of the TIPP (floating internal tax on oil products), a transport check or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and the NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was suspended at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"It's an honor for our company to work with a person who inspired, no less than, the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival was to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organising of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we're stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location that, ultimately, will take place in Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the 2005 Lollapalooza festival at Chicago's Grant Park, after having made a mark on the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of 9.8M$ and 11.3M$ respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, whereas ours are more in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at once an impression of a European-style country festival and an American-style urban one".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the celebration of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer at this festival is "very big", like the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been thrown out to the groups, but nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will have a rock flavor, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers", says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3 members, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal is up against Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood movie plates to Montreal when nothing but Terminator is opposed to that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the " runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best", he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the cinema here.
The race for the Oscars is on.
All West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to showcase Quebec films, give them value and make sure that filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the Santa Monica box office and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
The experts, divided by the subprime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that it will occur.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made on the basis of statistics alone, especially as uncertainties lurk in the markets at least in the short term".
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking a turn in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both the long and short periods".
The Commission has also taken the view that the market is likely to be more volatile, especially as the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulation by inflationary tensions.
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that it's not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"There is no such thing as too much joy", says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs of November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be moved forward to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news that comes from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will drive the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is for the big values".
The expert would include the two big banks and some construction companies in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it take place.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path", the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological ones will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month only twice.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw a rebound of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
200 in all, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
The same applies to the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeatedly stated that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he's about to close a deal with the unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for whether other entities will take up or not this initiative that follows the business hours.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
To attract the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but the remodelling of existing ones.
To this end, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers on the different streets.
The extension of the office hours is thus accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more contemporary design with brighter colours.
The commercial banking manager, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring is not a big investment, but a bigger hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
Branches on Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be correct, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the brand Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrants, also with very wide hours, even opening on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises, they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We did it.'
With that phrase, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the market, when he noticed that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'It is what hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent advance.
That gain puts his loss in what we've been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The value on the stock exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4.488,88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday ceded 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how profitable we make it in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network to exceed the gross advertising revenue of 1,000 million, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the chief executive of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this figure were to be realised, the TV network would record a 3.6% increase in its advertising turnover in the financial year compared to 965,4 million in the financial year 2006.
Net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734,4 million) while net revenues from television grew by 0,7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the better relative development in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its matrix Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we can satisfy our shareholders, who have already been valued with 33% of Endemol.'
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of a certain tiredness at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
They explain that this is because the projected revenue growth has been reduced from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4,5% in 2008 and by 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based primarily on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
The second.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulating) better than Antena 3 (maintaining) because of the 'attractive multiples' and business growth.
The third.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases as they have 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best rules to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of institutions so that markets can function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, modernises financial markets, strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NSMC) and encourages cooperation between the various supervisors in the European Union.
The new rules will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firm (FSA), financial advisory firms (FAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems, which will compete with current exchange operators.
The Law also requires investment firms to disclose information on the market about key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management practices and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Committee, several amendments were incorporated, among which it is noted that securitised debt is considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, as has been demonstrated by the case of US subprime mortgage debt.
The transposition of the directive also took advantage of the legal limitations on the roles of graduates in economics and business 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 which defined the professional roles of economists.
The Senate also introduced new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work as an outsourced agent, will not require the CNMV's authorization and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised CPI increased by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of how prices in Spain developed during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is for guidance only and does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has affirmed that the rise in a 4,1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes pointed out in the halls of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union is still "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data presented today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had record deposits of over £25,000 million, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of 100 per cent of that money offered by the Government and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that is deposited over the next three years to get those remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion pounds.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Consortium, which includes three other companies, as its favorite bid to bail it out of bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested today at the first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urbanistic corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consortium and the head of the Municipality Police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then municipal councillor, last May, and according to sources consulted by Cadena SER, he could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents are still searching municipal offices and the Urbanism department and no more arrests are expected in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported by the SER chain yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore aforesaid, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE's Toledo candidacy and preside over Congress if they win the polls
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and be president of the Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the ex-minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who made public his decision on 15 November not to run in the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he gets into office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or scream" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times".
He also praised his current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good work" and did not want to see himself occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
The climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjecting to relentless persecution both of those who are skeptical of its predictions and of those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron consistency.
And a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in its failure to comply with Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors has it occurred and why your government, the one with the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
It also demands that he explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to make, what economic consequences will it have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been and will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he has hurried to deny it.
So, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we ride a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for a suspected urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Urbanism Council and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Judge number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been released today.
According to sources, the former governor of Totana and today an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as has the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and Viguese businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the Group cited, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven registrations, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested at the time in Totana, namely the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2,2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Viguese parking lots on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the plaza of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that happen
The first.
If you like, we'll leave the Book of the Month thing alone, see if we can think of another "premium" and other competitions in the meantime.
I'm already writing something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
The second.
Our Finnish correspondent provides this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (which, by the way, is the leader of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what was published on November 18, the same day that the Blackburn book review appeared there, curiously:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has leapt to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes".
The third.
A colleague shares information about the introduction of internet downloading offences into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a felony punishable by six months to a year.
However, if you steal records in the store for less than 400 euros, it is simply a misdemeanour (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than the tax on the discharge (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It's less serious to get into a fight than to get into a swap.
Participating in a tumultuous fight has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without the authorization of the authors is punished more severely than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
So, if my colleague is right, someone is getting a hand, a very long hand.
4. The
My GP hands me one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out by magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognitive Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that if both players were paid the same amount when they hit, the activation was moderate, but if one player was paid twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don't know if it took that much science to make that conclusion.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavia Criminal Court, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list of the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach's documentary 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeing criminals and pressure the involved governments to tighten the siege.
What insurance is good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of a potential accident, is a major expense, depending on a number of factors, such as age, sex, age of the licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And the fact is, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the model of vehicle.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the chance of an accident, the higher the premium.
That is why both over 25s and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
Also, based on the count, the companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of accident.
Increasing the frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will explain the most important variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face a number of disadvantages in purchasing affordable insurance, such as lack of driving experience and the age of the licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is all-hazard insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with deductible, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, chief executive in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third party insurance, whereby the customer is protected against damage to third parties, but not against damage to his own car.
Plus, it would be covered for theft, arson and vehicle loss.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic tariff.
'Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses", Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, drivers find it easier to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced by the experience gained.
For this reason, it is best to hire a franchise-based all-risk.
"Young people are usually unable to make use of the experience they have acquired in an accident, or even in driving", says the Spanish director of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'newbie's fear' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children, it is preferable that he negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as his financial situation permits it, of course.
On the other hand, children are considered by the insurers as the least likely to be injured, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be all-risk insurance with deductible (which can be 300 euros) or, where a high level of bonus is available, third party insurance extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They are more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise", said Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out deductible all-risk insurance (€150), or extended third-party insurance if you have a high level of bonus.
Car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that's worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measuring this Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the 'Champions' league, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified their pass in the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to make sure Shakhtar, with six, and receiving Benfica, who has four, does not overtake them.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th day in semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
So, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although both teams will try to go for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the eighths.
Gordon Strachan's team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but they can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other straight match.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are hoping to get into the eighth place for the second time in the reorganized Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal by Kaka in the extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case it loses Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to stay in the UEFA.
And that is that Benfica, despite being last and without any options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which would play the UEFA.
20,000 people in Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls have kicked off their first tour since disbanding in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, to an audience of 20,000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before they began their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out to attend the concert, which included a video telling the story of the group that made waves in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd crowding GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had forbidden it days earlier.
In the preview of the show's opening, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our costumes, at all, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the quintet to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feeling of the world had changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision", Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
The five have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They'll be performing in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed through Ukraine, so every touch between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, gas monopoly owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has committed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transit routes for gas during the talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly drove up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal record records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The recommendation by the Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, their report pointed out other checks that are being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should have guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: 'our report highlights areas where improvements can be made to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of overseas staff in the NHS'.
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is", he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residency permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures set out by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being broadly complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidance for foreigners' pre-employment in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon says: "I had a great interest in this work being carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health boards, could consider the recommendations in the reports and that this would be reflected in the updating of pre-employment control guidelines for all work groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at the film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the best film award.
Trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal".
And the Bond star, Daniel Craig, won the variety award for bringing a British film to the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced for just £3,000.
But also the winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, who won two awards - for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - as Julien Temple's film about Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a chauffeur for a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's film Promises from the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard to get, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me", he declared.
"I was fortunate to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor".
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern province, the television report stated.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launching expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of those arrested were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as militants to Al-Qaeda to fight allied forces and back the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants have targeted many religious leaders in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work", the spokesman for the interior minister told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give a glimpse of Earth's future
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like a twin of Earth than had been observed previously.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and orbit, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is high enough to melt lead, and it is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency's Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a picture of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago".
Police confiscates "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It still stays open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday evening, November 28th were more ridiculous than the question the snow monkey asked the Democrats about climate warming at the Republican Party YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the run-up to next year's election.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, which co-sponsors the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the candidates as aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to one topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest exchanges of words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leading light in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both stay in the race perhaps because both warned about the immigration issue before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic Chinese toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned uncomfortable when other issues emerged.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to run in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coinciding with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul and his heated remarks at Wednesday's debate.
They both came out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party could not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The European Union
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it still emerges
With political scandals still raging in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
There does not appear to have been any influence selling, nor are there any exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor any extramarital finger-sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English governing Labour party, totaling more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party has not reported him.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister evaded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls had no bearing on his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, demonstrated weakness in regulation and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authorities lost 25 million personal data which revealed an unimaginable administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it's the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is walking irrevocably to the exit.
Governments may reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it's clear that the prime minister can't make things better, that he doesn't have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers get exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn't focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
As much as I'd like to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax authority, are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even though he's not directly involved in the Blairish setbacks - or "cash for partners", the investigation of political party funding - voters can assume that he is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one's been killed, or directly scammed.
And the remedy, painful as it is, is to give what Mr Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not his.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's deal, and that it wasn't illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raiser chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is so far not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took over the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but he is diluted in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals aren't complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a police matter.
There are other things Mr Brown must do, too, such as finding a permanent, independent head of the Standards Committee on Public Life, which he has not had for six months, and pressing for genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard work by Labour and the Tories in cooperation, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial position of the unions - bitter measures for a party man like Mr Brown.
But he has to face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for some dorsal fins to swim around excitedly.
Today, with the American housing market in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already showing.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been redeemed or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 million charge on its American consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it's too early to panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third-quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American Bankruptcy Law of Persons (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represented a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of default) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid repayment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty solid, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection from the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit card debts now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more to the flow of cash than to assets, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They may even work to out-run the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to repay the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, paying off the card debt rises to the top of the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders encounter by changing interest rates or altering creditors' balances.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reevaluate all the loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with former Enron financial bureau chief Andrew Fastow were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial transaction in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron corporation controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind behind a myriad of frauds at Enron that helped its downward spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January of 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide millions in debt or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, over 60 million in market values and over 2 million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction on conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But nobody asks for that model with so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents".
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their exhibition stands, hoping to lure the newly wealthy Russians into all sorts of products, from mahogany yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche in the booth next to his".
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and brass compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets".
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was in its heyday.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to Europe, where they were seen as materialists", says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders".
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion dollars, according to Forbes' list of richest people.
In addition, the second-rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money amounts to $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here", says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweler David Morris.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very dignified".
Visiting the fair Sunday night, dressed in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum foam cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
Tickets are available for the general public for 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand at the Royal Dutch Delft Porcelain, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said that wealthy Russians with more experience (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be displayed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people - cash millionaires, millionaire emissaries, or tourists - fill the hallways each day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems for $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car grills shaped like chain bracelets for a Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays of Swarovski colored glass embedded in it, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, he's not necessarily going to drive on those wheels", says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars".
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash", he said.
"There's more of them than you think".
Those who weren't millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with piles of fake one-million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors would stop and shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while they rested on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", says Karryev.
"Skin" surgery could be cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance come up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Ave. house.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they're waiting for the tox screen, although the results won't be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mystery death that has plagued the upper ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Chief Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian".
She was protecting me".
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Liquor Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities", Walsh declared.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they got to the house around 3: 00 p.m.
November 21st and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a rotting rose bush sits in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was found in the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanging by hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he came to Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him get to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She'd say, 'You have to watch out for this or that,'" she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's awkward".
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were boosted by reassuring comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets eased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two to Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, declared that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued strain on financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising samples of credit exchanges, Mr Kohn said the recent turmoil was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, that it would cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost cut to offset losses on its investments in sub-prime mortgages in the US.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to come to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit stress in the markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which priced these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and ECB and inject extra funds into the London stock markets, strained credit and three-month "Libor" lending rates among British banks, making it the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara to court
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat the No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the manager of England, is starting to fill with offers to become national coach, and if not, a part-time one.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth batting position will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It's not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that the choice is difficult, for it requires judgments which always end up being subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, were promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who's to say what's a good level for a cricketer, unless he's given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who is surely playing in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from these.
The Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium may be only a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first ones, taking 5 wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a player of importance, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The odds are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Mumbai, 32 first-class centuries against just 6 from Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting some of the momentum that he had in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He is attached to nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his car at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slip pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, because he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which is not to say Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, driving out the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who were hoping for the city to return to normalcy.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of Syrian and Jordanian refugees who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it's safe now".
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people", he says, referring to the Shiite militia of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease fighting.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria as the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied US force had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of their stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed my support and that of my comrades".
"That is why I have come back today", declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since US troops entrenched groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left it".
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite areas and vice versa, easing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-ignite sectarian tensions and start fighting.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the people of Sarland lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sardinian that we are not French" - that was the ironic motto about themselves of the smallest federal state for its 50th anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a large role in the Saarland education system, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" came in fifth place.
Thus, higher education institutions traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Even today students can finish their university studies here with two or three degrees.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in secondary schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"The Saarland system takes advantage of vocational education", says Axel Plünnecke, the education expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people complete their baccalauréat at the Vocational School.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational-academic education is very wide.
The offer of dual careers, in relation to the number of inhabitants, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in the general education schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative testing throughout the country.
In order to get the children to study as early as possible in the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it is free of charge.
Comparison with future studies will show whether the pupils' performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students with a learning disability has decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve as much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, the students can calculate better.
To the dismay of the people of Sardinia, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although the people of the Saarland are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Schools.
Chavez is changing the time.
Soon Venezuela will have another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allowed the South American country to change its time by moving the clock back half an hour.
Currently Chavez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin, according to the new law, the time will be four hours GMT minus.
Thus the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed the obligation on the world in his day by changing a full hour.
Also, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it", says Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-rich country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision made by Uribe when he withdrew the mandate of Chavez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was a question of the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
In Spain too, there is much talk about Chávez.
A new call-tone is causing a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This was the phrase uttered by the King of Spain, who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
A forecast for this year shows that a fall in real wages is threatening German employees despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a host of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, the real wage bill for German employees in 2007 should be lower than in the previous year.
"The fault lies with weak wage developments, rising value-added taxes and the price of food and energy", Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on Economic Cycles reported to the newspaper "Bild".
The new unemployment insurance charges may also be payable to employees.
The Minister for Finance, Peter Setinbrück, told the "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" newspaper that, given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is just and reasonable.
Of course, the employment office does not have to get into a bad situation again, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, according to a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was announced that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
Compared with last year, prices are up 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been considered until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades researchers had suspected that lightning might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere, where lightning strikes from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus, it is not: if life ever existed there, it would have to be in one of the earliest stages of evolution", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, life cannot exist on the surface of Venus. The atmospheric pressure is nearly 100 times greater than on Earth, and the surface is 500°C hot, so low that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Venus is possibly a 'diabolical' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin", Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest research results, which will be featured in many articles in Nature, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that the neighboring planets have more in common with Earth than we had assumed", reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers also discovered a vortex of clouds in the south polar region that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth's poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute for Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the solar system is almost as massive as the earth, and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers, it is almost as large.
This planet also called the morning star or evening star orbits the sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars, does not bear much resemblance to Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under the same conditions.
On both planets, water had clumped together, which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had been converted into carbon rocks, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end this fight over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as ONE divided nation", Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me", said Koehler.
The German presidency has also been involved in the negotiations with the EU and the EU.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of the One China policy.
China knows that too", said Koehler.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and was attacked by the members of the Union.
Mr Steinmeier criticised the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
The Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to news sources in the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Prime Minister, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Street battles with police, gunfire, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns of riots like France's.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not spread to the streets.
Barricades were set up, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for the Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also make sure that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence".
"We have to take that seriously", he told the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people are engaged in the constantly changing social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference on Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits".
It's still too early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people have been leading serious riots in the streets with the police in the north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called on the Federal Government to make greater efforts towards integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of a mimic effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
But action is needed.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 is above average.
We must ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great deal of social control in the family", greater than in France.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But we still have to be careful".
The aim is to 'provide young people with the opportunity to get a job or vocational training more quickly'.
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before a team of almost 1000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of the Interior, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the deaths of the young men were not the fault of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The Federal Chancellor's actions, which are far from reality, show that the coalition has reached its final stage and that nothing more can be expected of her.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and contentless performance in the general debate in the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and so showed he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
The House of Commons made it very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no interest or feeling in the country's problems.
But instead Angela Wolke presented herself as a very high-level politician who flees into foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken at Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate targets should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford such modesty.
Well, he's got a way of expressing himself so that people get a sense of urgency.
And so it damages its public image by the pragmatic approach to solving problems without going over the edges.
But in Angela Wolke's realm, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how many times you get it wrong when you talk about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It starts to stumble "as if it had been in unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated Republican presidential debate on YouTube and now must fear only an outside candidate.
The tensions between the candidates are noticeable from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a safe haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has no clear favorite so far, the eight presidential candidates are taking advantage of the debate on CNN, mostly to discredit their opponents.
The short 30-second videos, shot by Internet users and uploaded to YouTube, don't have much content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power", that was John McCain's rebuke to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam War veterans when he refuses to acknowledge waterboarding, a method of interrogation, as torture by letting a person drown and simulating his death.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are other, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied tax increases.
That way you can see where both favorites are weak.
"I was wrong at the time", Romney explains in a sad tone, apologizing to the people and the television audience for his support for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, was at a loss for words when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after he resigned as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
So ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took the oath of office for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling the state for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the declaration of a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawmakers who have supported Musharraf, and last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s is still active: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
A re-release was made of "Live 1974" which was written at the band's heyday.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused a sensation.
Each of them has his box, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes its own sounds, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
The point to be made here is this: the questions accurately showed that the name of the band was resonating in people's minds, but it wasn't something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misguided Krautrock was always valued more in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded the members of the Cologne band Can 2003 with an "Echo" music award for their life's work, the German pop artists' surprised faces could be seen in the hall.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he were an old friend.
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad, they're one thing.
It's a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler for some time and had a name, Cluster, that promised great fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for financial reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the First Commune, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
They say, one day a banner of Ottenstein's singing association Harmonia appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages to using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against custom.
In 1975 the band announced their split.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and ensuring their existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that's thanks to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like Roedelius' work, the Neu! band was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are pictures of Harmonia with producers at a farm.
The story of the legend's development is shown in the black-and-white photo projections, where instruments with wires are seen.
In the background are three veterans who have started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and drums so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music today is what it was meant to be.
Three people who are deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere, coughing, whispering and at a good moment of emphasis singing "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
But it was never about rock.
The genre's origin was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68!" here is also right, but now Harmonia is calm.
On stage, you reflect very well on what is already obvious.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere is only missing more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are too focused on action and shootings or both films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
The good news was at the beginning: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it was there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the 1980s, because nobody wanted to see him after his pleasant, unimportant roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important plot to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party - When a Hunter Becomes What He Chases".
The film has a wonderful presentation for the viewer: at bottom, his role as a war reporter is the presentation of what Richard Gere might have done, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best days of life were past, who as a monument to the ruin of his decline still retained most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is a German production and will also be released this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The film's meaning is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The movie is like the German series "Alarm fur Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two roles), the story about American war reporters who go to track down a Serbian war criminal named "Sorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to accomplish something the army can't do, and each time it's a crazy trip.
One reason "The Hunting Party" failed is when we were introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be just a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also includes a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who they're going to kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with amazing speed accomplish what NATO, the CIA and all the other headhunters in the world couldn't accomplish for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to get their revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, that you get a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem, it's a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing my feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party", there are also these demons, but they prove how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently, a newspaper published that all the movies about Iraq produced in Hollywood are failures.
It may also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There's almost always a rule: when a star goes into a crisis region or into a minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Across the Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may have occurred in a short space of time.
It's going to take at least decades before Hollywood makes a good movie about the Holocaust, with the movie "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films need more time already. The classics like the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two television sets at home.
And that's because screenwriters have no qualms (which is necessary to be able) about telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Maybe you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic, distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change".
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response negative criticism about the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds us to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has encouraged such motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides", von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance".
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements made by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to let the opportunity slip away, if at this point the plans are ruined", said Günter Ploß, director of HSB, on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is in contradiction to the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Higher Schools Sport (ADH).
There von Beust designated the Hamburg application for Universities 2015 not as "a substitution" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Just last week the High School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) criticized the senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was lagging behind with the development of the small Grasbrook neighbourhood, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses", said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a lot of excitement.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
If you associate the terms Sweden and wooden box, you think of Ikea, but you don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the 94 "type" Brillo-Boxes on this list are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet, are fake, and nearly a hundred of the other "Stockholm-type" ones, which are in circulation on the international art market, are also.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painting the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same pattern as they had on the "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Moderna Museet exhibited hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Stockholm-type" "Brillo-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left were produced and exhibited, he was left with them.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservators at the Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three privately owned Swedish ones that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed plates.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York does not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibits".
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "grave accusations" that they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on everything there remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The head of the party, Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly 200 soldiers had been entrenched for hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, and suddenly he was able to settle with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military police who were supposed to be watching him had crossed over to his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops have blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"People are fed up", said Trillanes.
