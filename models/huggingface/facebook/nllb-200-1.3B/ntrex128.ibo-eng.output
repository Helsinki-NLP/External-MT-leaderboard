Welsh AM is getting the hang of you as a toy
There is concern among some AMs for consideration that their names should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It was started as a result of a plan to change the name of the local body to the Welsh Assembly.
AMs across various political parties are concerned that it could lead to scandal.
The Labour MP said his party was concerned that It was falling to Twp and Pwp.
For book fighters outside Wales: In Welsh twp means piece, pwp means poison.
AM Dressed in Wool said that the same as the whole and angry, that it has other things to compare.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open-minded" about the name change, but claimed it was a brief transition from MWP to Sports.
In this sense the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Commission of the National Assembly, which drafted the legislation to introduce the name change, stated: The final decision and any interpretation of what is referred to as the Members of the National Assembly shall be the matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Assembly Government of Wales Plan 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the objectives which found support for the dissolution of the National Assembly to be the Welsh Assembly.
In terms of the nomination of the AMs, the Commission relied on the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP's choice received the most support from public consultation.
The AMs are certainly suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach an agreement could be a headache for Chief Operating Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a written order for the changes in the coming weeks.
The rules for the amendments will include further changes to the way the national assembly works, including rules for the dismissal of the AMs and the architecture of the party system.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they vote on the bill.
Macedonians to vote on the choice of changing their country's name
Voters will cast their ballots on Sunday to decide whether their country will change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was held to settle a long-standing dispute between neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
After Athens had admitted that the name of its mountain neighbours reflected claims to its territory, they proceeded to block its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the election and the name change, has threatened to ignore the election.
However, supporters of the appointment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the corruption and name change was the only price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Bells of St. Martin's Fall as Harlem's Church and Nationals are Called
"Old story, the elders I spoke to said that there were bars and churches everywhere", said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them.
He said that he understood the origin of the wines.
"People are coming together in different ways now", he said.
Bar is no longer a room in a neighborhood that people frequent regularly.
For the church members, it is a concern that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders thought, but sooner or later they will return to where they started.
The church, he added, could be replaced by a larger residential building, which would have a more humane and less helpful environment in the rest of the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people and the purchase of apartments in these houses will be white, he said, so they will speed up the day of the church's closure because it will be difficult for most people to enter these houses and become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the Black City in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first Methodist congregation left in 1930.
Six black congregations worshiping nearby took the name from the building.
Black congregations took over St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a blockade of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who prevented taking or supporting blacks in markets.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, but as Father Johnson's churchmen planned to renovate the building, they rebuilt the bell.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, fondly called the bell the "bell of the poor".
The expert who struck the bell in July called it something else: Cultural heritage as well as Historical resources cannot be replaced.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who visited the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been reported at St. Martin over the past few months has been a mix of conspiracy theorists and conspirators, some brought in by the church's leadership, others by the church's subdivision under the control of the Bishops.
The Training House - the church's administrative body, which is filled with leaders - wrote to the church department in July for suggestions that the church department would be willing to transfer the bills to the barn, even though the barn was not involved in hiring the plumbers and builders the church department sent.
Some church members complained of a lack of revelation in the church department.
13-year-old injured by shark in California lobster raid
A shark knocked down and injured the 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was forced into the water for a lobster hunt in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The quake occurred before 7 am along the Beacon River in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends were forced into the water around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he and some others crossed the boat to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first that he thought it was a novelty to hold a lobster, but then he found out that it was screaming, "I'm done!"
I'm going to die!'
Having all his legs torn off,  Hammel said he noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The type of shark that made the nest is unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles told the news outlet that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a bad shark.
Giles added that the victim had extensive injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed the river from the Ponto River side in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas within 48 hours for exploration and protection purposes.
Giles also said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not seen as aggressive.
Sainbury's plans to enter the UK jewellery market
Sainbury and Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with a cosmetics-friendly storefront filled with professional assistants.
As part of the UK's £2.8bn cosmetics market push, which continues to grow the apparel and home furnishings market in return, the cosmetics line will be tested in 11 stores around the city and rolled out to other stores next year if successful.
The money in jewelry is coming as stores are looking to fill the void previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would expand the size of its cosmetics line to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw first.
Existing brands ranging from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also have slots in areas with similar brands to those found in stores such as Boots.
The stores are reopening their stores to sell cosmetics so that most of the products are animal-friendly - something that consumers are now growing in demand.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will be testing licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the move to everyday grocery shopping in smaller local stores means that big retailers have more work to do to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that smaller stores will continue to be more like supermarkets while department stores are trying to replace the discounted Aldi and Lidl by combining more services with non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been installing the Argos mini-store in several stores, and has imported a significant number of Habitats since it bought the two companies two years ago, which it says has increased food sales and increased the purchase's profitability.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to re-launch drug discovery and sales have failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture between Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over how profits from the pharmacy stores would be divided among its larger customer base.
The new standard comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would work on the plan, by adding shares of the famous and attractive skincare stores such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel that has been the norm in our jewellery to create a more environment for our customers.
We also spend money on specialists who are readily available to provide advice.
The size of our brand is designed to fit all needs, beautiful surroundings and a great atmosphere means that we promote a decorative environment that is challenging among the old ways of doing business.
Angry with Peter Jones as Holly Willoughby backs out of £11million deal
Dragons Den's Peter Jones is filled with anger as TV presenter Holly Willoughby resigns from an £11million deal with her lifestyle business to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for the clothing and home furnishings business Truly.
Put both of their businesses on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Market.
This Morning anchor, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den manager Peter Jones in a rage by stepping down from their successful live-in business last season - to focus on her new deal with the likes of Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reporters said Jones was angry when the much-loved TV star admitted during a rally on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth £1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough time to focus on the clothing and accessories business Truly.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop sale, predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to visit one of his holiday homes.
A headline said: Truly is really the most in Holly's needs.
It should be his future in the hands of the government that will take care of him for the next decade.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the negotiation.
No one can be sure what happened on Tuesday, it came very close to the beginning.
There is a warehouse of stuffed goods in Marlow Headquarters that is ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning's anchor, one of Britain's most popular and profitable, could cost the store millions due to the huge budget on products ranging from chairs and candles to furniture and home furnishings, as well as the possibility of further executions in its early days.
It may be the end of the long line.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, a mother of three, were friends with Jones and Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016, Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The couple and their retirement fund together, Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV advertising company.
Willoughby will be the corporate vice president of M&S, and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said last night "We are not able to talk about his business".
The hardest thing is when we love each other
He has been ridiculed for the hateful comments he would receive from the media for making certain statements that would be considered un-presidential and for having good faith for the North Korean president.
Why is President Trump so forgiving?
Trump said in a press conference that he would be interviewed.
I have nothing left.
He also said Kim was interested in a second summit after the first one in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea's massive nuclear arsenal.
But the talks on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to the ongoing efforts to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he added, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions designed to stifle the fire.
Trump followed the idea of good faith in his closing remarks.
"We are doing great things in North Korea", he said.
We have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of lives could be lost.
Now we have a big pig
He said his efforts to improve relations between Kim and the US have produced positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free the victims and restoring the remains of dead American soldiers.
He also defended his different approach to the case for the rapes along with Kim.
"It's very easy to make a president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing around trying to get into a crowded room, we have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, with the demographics in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroy Islands, Kill Many
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign delegations were told that they were not needed by the government.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, the first reason for seeking foreign aid.
"Mostly, sadly, they made it clear that they don't need foreign help, so it's a challenge", Ms. Sumbung said.
With Save the Children booking a team to visit Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work in the country.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign companies would be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Plagued by Indonesia's frequent earthquakes, the city is not prepared or prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami watchtowers have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other waterways.
The absence of tsunami warning signs in Palu, even with the warning signs, could contribute to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between most of the islands of Indonesia is a struggle.
National disasters further complicate the organization.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's attempt to upgrade Indonesia's infrastructure has damaged the theme of his election campaign, but he has wasted money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's lack of money and political ambitions are waiting for re-election next year.
Mr Joko and the security forces have long been under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority Muslim community has embraced a form of security of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in street fights, using knives, bows and spears, and other vicious weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's reaction in the final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was 30 yards outside of Chelsea's goal as his team chased 1-0.
He put the ball in his left hand before he shot at the top of the post.
The test went over the box as it moved along the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually passed Kepa Arrizabalaga with a stretched arm and fell into the net.
"It's trying to get in the position, to hold the ball and players like Shaq and his team are going to be in front all the time how much more powerful, so I myself tried to put myself out there how much more powerful", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, touched him once, didn't think much about it, shot him immediately.
Chelsea led 1-0 after a break after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian legend Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a back leg pass in the game, before he ran across the midfield and into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a famous half-speed in the stadium.
He threw a beautiful ball, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard jumped over the line and hit the net with a left-footed shot and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool and Napoli will go head-to-head in the first leg of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the city's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It is reported that most people were trapped under the collapsed buildings caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that on Friday triggered a 20-foot high wind, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, and investigate a murder after a woman was stabbed
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhard, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stab wound in Grayson Mews and John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in a murder investigation.
Police are asking people in the area to come forward if they see or hear anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy but I would ask anyone at the John Street station in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can catch anything on the dashcam to contact us as they may have information that is important for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found was a local in Birkenhead, found in a bank.
This afternoon friends believe they know the woman has come to the camp to inquire about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is now underway according to the police and they are ready to inform the deputy of the victim.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mew tried to break in but police told him that no one was coming in or out of the house.
She was shocked when she learned what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be a long time before they are allowed to re-enter.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area was seen as a crime camp.
A woman came into the park weeping.
He was repeating the bad news.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the line and another car was outside.
Some police officers stood in the line and searched the houses.
Anyone with information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 at 247 records as of September 30.
Cromwell's design of the Parliament has become the latest monument to the controversy over the rewrite of old history.
His expulsion would be punishment for his Taliban-like attacks on many of England's cultural and religious structures, which were perpetrated by troublesome Puritan persecutors.
But the Cromwell Group described Mr Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and "an attempt to rewrite an old story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Group, said: "It is inevitable that the current debate over the removal of Oliver Cromwell's skeleton and skulls from the exterior of the Palace of Westminster will be the focus.
The religious symbolism that was broken during the English Civil War was not ordered or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would be unjustly executed for the crimes committed by his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell was a bright spot in 19th-century thought and part of the narrative of a man many people believed should be exalted.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is much more highly regarded, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the protector of parliament for external influence, in his political speeches.
But that is not a fully accurate representation and is now the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the struggle of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our country, and Cromwell was a figure of note who illustrated one aspect of that division.
His status as the Supreme Protector is worthy of exaltation and remembrance.
A Chinese Farmer Stung by a Rooster and Murdered
A farmer was stabbed and killed by a pig in a market in western and southern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who used only his surname Yaun, was found dead, with a ruptured nerve, covered in blood near the pig house in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer and fisherman approved the injection of vaccines into domestic pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he and his nephew travelled to the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her nephew found her dead, and he found a way into an open house.
He said in the pigsty was a large quantity of real blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination believes that the 550 fine loads fell on the farmer, by the story.
"My nephew's feet are covered in blood and scars", said the nephew, who took his father's name and gesture Wu,, according to Guiyan Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am Thursday to feed the right people.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yaun's or his nephew's.
A store manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from getting into another man's hands, while the police were collecting supplies in the park.
Yuan's family and business leaders discussed the cost of his death.
Although rare, actual sexual intercourse is a well-documented occurrence.
In 2016, a female pig attacked her in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, 650 piglets ran over a Welsh farmer and his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pig was eaten by an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Mantioba farmer told CNC News that the pig was violent but the taste of blood could be a stimulant.
They were just afraid.
They are small, they have great desires ... they cannot hurt you.
You should give it the proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Superstorm Rosa will cause severe cyclones to spread across the western and southern US.
As the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is poised to pass over the icy waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains that will cause flooding across northern Mexico as well as western and southern U.S. states in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 intensity, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, it is located 385 miles west and south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Now, a large gap has begun to accumulate across the Pacific Ocean and eastward to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California coast on Monday as a storm surge, it will begin to move deeper northward into the western and southern U.S.
Rosa will be raising 10 inches of rain in the Mexican side on Monday.
Then, the storm and mixing into a large gap that comes will create a massive storm surge that will spread west and south over the coming days.
In the region, a drop of 1 to 4 inches will cause severe flooding, wet grassland and swampland could be deserted.
Deepwater currents will cause tidal waves of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour and phase, mostly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As expected 2 to 4 inches of hail in some parts of the West and south, especially across Arizona.
There may be flooding with conditions and rapid damage due to the nature of the storm surge.
It would be a very bad advice to walk into a desert where there is a danger of a cyclone.
High tides can turn canyons into angry rivers and thunderstorms and forecasts will bring storms and sand and spray.
The massive opening and approach will bring some heavy rainfall along the Southern California coast.
A collapse of more than half an inch of water may occur, which can cause a slight sweat and traffic and traffic jams.
This would be the first spring of the region's rainy season.
Some of the tornadoes spread through Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the tornadoes spread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rainfall will spread to Zone Four on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may see some strong temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will be warmer.
Sometimes this leads to a dramatic change in demand over a short period of time.
There is a large sample of dramatic temperature differences across the U.S. and on Saturdays.
There are up to 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will continue to try to dry up and get hotter again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see early October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the East and North.
New York City may experience temperatures of 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. beyond the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of the 1980 rape of Christine Blasey Ford, on the mainstream television network.
Now that the political stalemate continues, the media is in the process of launching what should have been a last-minute Friday shift: a deal that Arizona's Jeff Flake has planned for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunkenly beaten her and tried to rob her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a highly influential statement, said he was 100 percent sure he hadn't.
There is a chance that over 20.4 million people watched the Nielsen ratings on Friday.
The station also counts average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen often has problems with the audience in their industry.
To make sense of that, that's the size of the spectators that are at the winner's football stadium or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose thoughtful editors strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, topped all networks by having an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day attendance, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC has 2.89 million subscribers and CNN has 2.52 million subscribers, Nielsen said.
Interest increased after the ban was lifted.
Flake is a focus on Friday's story.
As moderate Republican media released his confession to be filed against Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning with angry and hateful protesters as he attempted to enter the elevator to attend the Judicial Conference.
He modestly waited several minutes for the cursing, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Does he seem to be honest with our people?
She was told, You have power when most women do not.
Flake said his company had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the convention.
Cable networks and media were covering the events immediately after, when the Judicial Conference was supposed to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full House of Representatives for election.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the charges against the nominee in the coming weeks, which the Democrats are in the minority.
Flake's mind changed slightly in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
After Coons's deliberations, several lawmakers later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was valid, because it meant that Republicans did not have a vote to support Kavanaugh and did not conduct the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accused critics of "politicising" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "politicising" Britain's future for its plans to leave the European Union and damaging public interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on his own page on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson has confirmed his concerns about his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should both collect taxes is a "big deal".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected in Dyteon Simpson and the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities uploaded a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB said.
After questioning, the police said Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued the first report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department and the Louisiana State Police force, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens assisting in the investigation led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for uchu and her prostitution investigation.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "in shock" and "deeply saddened" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you always think", Wade said.
Volcano erupts ashes in Mexico City
The ash plumes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern tip of the Mexican mainland.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after damage was detected in the crater, and it recorded 183 gas and ash surges over 24 hours.
The station monitors a wide range of sounds and earthquakes.
Images in public toilets showed small ash platforms and covered cars in the central Mexico City neighborhood of Xochimilco.
Geologists have detected eruptions and damage within the volcano 45 miles (72 km) east and south of the mainland since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalonian separatists clashed before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands of people joined another protest to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia referendum with a protest.
One supporter of the split covered their faces with police and barricades painted in gray, creating a black cloud of dust on roads that are often crowded with passengers.
Later that day, a fight broke out as the police used sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, the pro-independence movement was chanting "Never forget, never forgive" in front of the united protestors, "Life is for Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
The pressure within the region to support independence has been building in the year since the October 1 election in Madrid which saw the extreme but already deadly separatist Catalonia.
Voters voted all to remain independent, although turnout was low as non-partisan parties scorned the election.
By the Catalonian authorities up to 1000 people were injured last year as the military police tried to stop the vote from proceeding to polling stations across the area of the major clashes.
The pro-freedom groups went to the streets on Friday to stop the protests with the support of the national police.
The protest continued but they were allowed to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, who participated in the separatist protests led by his wife said he had lost hope for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
Last year we saw one of the best times in our lives.
I cried to my parents for the opportunity to vote but now we are ready", he said.
Even managing a brief significant victory in the regional elections held last December, the pro-Catalonia parties have struggled to keep pace this year as most of their best-known leaders have fled or are in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the election and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone with the support of the police, said that the political parties on both sides had provoked the clash.
He spoke hearts of people with great effort,.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's top officials who has been in prison and awaiting trial since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament election.
"Putting forward a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reverse the regression to democracy and the persecution we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly breaking into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged as well as the building itself.
The car may have been faulty at one time or another.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought victory
Livingston encouraged the Rangers to include Steven Gerrard in his second 18-game relegation as manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Menga's goal stood as Gary Holt's team moved up to the same level as Hibernia in the second tier.
Gerrard's team with no victory on the way to the Premiership this year will face the reigning champions Hearts, who they are chasing by eight points, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extended their win streak with no response in the division to six games, while head coach Holt has not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost their opportunity to outsiders and the unintelligent
The Holt team should have been ahead before they scored, their hard play has caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed but lost his shot in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow had more difficulty in his shot as he finished to get the head ball that Craig Halkett had passed in front of the goal.
The four of them were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, hoping to upset the foreigners with a ball that had been thrown in the same place.
But that was the way they scored the important goal.
Rangers gave the free kick, Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to release Menga, who touched him once and came out of the middle of the box to score.
At the time, Rangers had all the balls but they were unable to pass the four defenders and post guard Liam Kelly was not in trouble,
The series continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to play his part.
The foot of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor was rejected by Scott Pittman, Lithgow missed the ball which Livingston again threw in a spot.
The ball came in repeatedly in Livingston's box, which was lost all, with two penalties being refused - one after Halkett had kicked Glenn Middleton in the leg, and one for touching the ball - they were refused.
A horror story by Livingston - a summary
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland and Tony Macaroni's Garden
The action and the consequences were tragic for Livingston.
In finding a man, they did well, going beyond expectations and their climbs.
The format and team have not changed much since their return to the top flight, but credit goes to Holt for the way he has handled the team since his arrival.
It has many spines.
Captain Halkett was a hard-working, defensive player, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the field for the entire game.
The Rangers have no motive.
Even the best games they had seen under Gerrard failed to reach the flags.
Their final ball was not enough - they only opened the scoring once against the home team, it was a development for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There was laughter and the sky was green (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders watched for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's diplomatic and diplomatic visit to Germany - which was aimed at settling relations between NATO allies.
They have been at odds over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police with security prevented the 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of dissidents - mostly Kurds - also made their voices heard, with a hatred of Erdogan's policies and the decision of the Germans to welcome him to the country.
The protest and the demonstration of the separatist who some Turkish immigrants from Germany call a hero while others see him as a dictator.
Deptford traffic accident: Cyclist killed in accident with car
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, east and south of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, the guards checked him out, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred within months of another cyclist who died in a kidney accident running off on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said police were working to identify the man and alert the next person.
Road closures and traffic congestion are in place, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six staff injured in riot
Six prison staff have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Department said.
A riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday which is still ongoing.
The Tornado specialists have been brought in to deal with the disorder, which includes eight police officers, and have been assembled in one place.
The workers were examined for small injuries to their faces there.
A spokesperson for the Prison Department said: Do not send trained prison staff to deal with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Do not visit six members for injuries.
We do not tolerate riots in our prisons, obviously those who bring it will be handed over to the police, they may spend longer in the cell.
HMP Long Lartin employs over 500 police officers, including some of the worst criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was receiving treatment in hospital after a prisoner put him to sleep.
Last October workers were called to a riot to solve a major problem of hardballs being used to hit workers.
Tropical Storm Rosa May Bring Flooding to Phoenix, Las Vega, and Salt Lake City (Possibly Summer)
It's rare to see a tornado hit Arizona, but that's something that could happen in the coming week as the remaining power from Typhoon Rosa passes over the Western and Southern Deserts, posing a threat of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for parts of western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, eastern and southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix immediately on Tuesday, arriving by Monday evening with a wet draft.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has tweeted that only 10 severe thunderstorms have persisted in the tropical storm or hurricane winds within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ coastline.
The current latest National Wind Rate Standard predicts 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with isolated concentrations reaching 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western and Southern Deserts including the central Rockies and the Great Basin can have 1 to 2 inches, isolated concentrations up to 4 inches and are hardy.
For those who are not afraid of flooding, Rosa's rains can be a blessing as the region experiences a severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of this water will be needed as the western and southern parts are currently experiencing severe drought.
By the U.S. Weather Survey, only over 40 percent experience at least one extreme summer, one of the second highest, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa falls across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still in strong storm strength Monday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The sea breeze enters the cooler waters of the Pacific and so it is rapidly descending.
So expect it to fall in Mexico with strong winds during the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Hailstorms across parts of Mexico can be severe, with the threat of flooding.
A rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California into the western and northern parts of Sonora, with up to 10 inches and potentially stronger, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north from Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona mainland early Tuesday morning as a hurricane, which will pass directly over Arizona and enter southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The most anticipated threat to life from Rosa or its remnants is the severe flooding in Baja California, western and northern Sonora, as well as the U.S. Western and Southern Deserts, the National Weather Service said.
These droughts are expected to create flooding that could kill people as well as sweat grass in the desert, and swampland in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton case: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in connection with an investigation into an attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a stabbing wound in Somerset.
The young man was found with a wound near the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he was in good condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon area, Somerset Police said.
Police have asked everyone to have a mobile phone photo of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, was hurt, angered by the Democrats
"A vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruelty and extreme ways of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the emotional, emotional and emotional pain of the Democratic Party in his election process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, angrily and bitterly denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she assaulted him ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to the prosecution's case against him.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and character and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to convict Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to convict one of the most mature legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service and activism", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president used a different approach to refer to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican nomination in the midterm elections.
Five weeks left before the most important election in our lives.
I'm not going out, but I'm really going out, he said.
So I was everywhere and supported the very good candidates.
Trump has been talking to Democrats on a march to stop and prevent.
The first major vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Earthquake, tsunami, and tsunami in Indonesia that killed hundreds, and the number is still rising
At least 384 people died, as a massive storm washed ashore, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when winds of up to six metres (18 feet) fell on the ground in the evening, killing most and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat started yesterday, people were doing their activities along the river, they did not run immediately, so it affected them, Sutopo Purwo Nugrogo, spokesperson for Indonesia's national disaster management agency BNPS said in a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come by itself, it took away cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground, said Nugroho, and it was said that the tsunami passed through the river at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the riverbank.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transported to 24 stations in Palu.
The blasts from the disaster site showed most of the houses and shops damaged, bridges rising and falling and mosques in a circular shape.
The earthquake continued along the coast on Saturday.
There was a series of earthquakes in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Research and Technological Development (BPPT) said the magnitude and intensity of the Friday quake was about 200 times the intensity of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's terrain, which lies at the end of a long, narrow stretch of river, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "spread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, leaving 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could extend along the coastline 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which lies near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications had no news but soap from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
He said this has been an accident, but it could get worse,.
The company was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in Palu, although officials said a strong wind came at the time the warning was issued.
In a photo shared at a public gathering a man can be heard on the roof shouting loudly warning of an approaching tsunami which he is telling people on the underground road.
Within minutes, a massive floodwaters came down the river, sweeping away houses and cars.
Reuters has not been able to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive power damage that disrupted communications in the Palu Valley and caused difficulties for the authorities and the organizing of rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes carrying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities for an immediate rescue.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the refugee shelter in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian Tsunami has exceeded 800.
It was very bad.
With World Vision staff from Donggala safely arriving in Palu city, while the staff and shelter under the covers of tapestries erected outside their factory, they passed the cycle of destruction on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said "They told me that they saw many houses destroyed".
It was very bad.
Even as relief teams began the painstaking work of starting the first stage of disaster relief, some reported that international aid workers with the necessary skills were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
By Indonesian law enforcement, foreign funds, equipment and personnel can only begin to travel if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened.
"It is still a field level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government said, Well, this is a national disaster, we can open for foreign aid but have not received any notification yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the still-missing held on to faith that their loved ones would be miraculous and trigger the spirits of the evil side of the disaster.
On Saturday, a baby was pulled out of a pit.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been lying under the rubbish for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the leader of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others detained under the Roa Roa Treasury Building, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As a paraglider, I have my own spiritual problems", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled one time, within an hour of the news of the Roa Roa Bank crash spreading through the paraglider, he quickly sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's rivals, who were participating in the beach party.
His message, however, appeared in only one gray, rather than a blue, brightly colored sign.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent", he said.
$26750 stolen by cold-blooded people during ATM bust in Newport, Levee
The robbers on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee at a revolving ATM in Newport and Levee, according to a report released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had cleared the ATM at the resort and was preparing to spend more money, Police Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While at work, another man from behind attacked the Brink's employee and stole the purse intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw several people with glasses and guns in the area, according to the confession, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the injuries.
Anyone with information for their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapa changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: Formerly Kanye West.
West, 41, has recently changed her stage name to Ye and used the moniker as the title of her eighth single, which was released in June.
The changes come ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new single Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show who was canceled due to a heart condition, the show's producer said.
Despite the brevity of his current identity, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe that you are the most used word in the Bible, in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his song with Big Boy radio executive.
So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, meaning alone, being alone - which is the expression of our good, our bad, our complex, everything.
That fear is also a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is sometimes referred to as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he expressed his preference for the titles Love and Brother Love.
Former Western partner, JAY-Z, has used but sometimes omitted punctuation and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged to refrain from civilian military service
Mexico's newly elected president Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to use no military or soap for civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the abuse of students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Mall that he would not use the military to oppress Mexican citizens.
Soldiers opened fire on a frosty march at the mall on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during the leftist student protests that began throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly scholarships and opening more free public universities.
He has also said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led to the youth being grouped with criminals.
U.S. should bring in twice the money from A.I.
As China becomes more proficient in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase its spending on research in the field, said AI researcher and promoter Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The publicity came as many parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no known AI plans.
On the other hand, China launched its strategy last year: it aims to be the number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Raising AI research funding twice would be a good start, I'm sure all other countries have reached the same level as the U.S., but we're looking for the next big surprise in AI", Lee said.
Raising the money twice could lead to the possibility that the next big AI development will be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China's most prominent AI company, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI system that won America's most prestigious Othello award, eventually becoming a vice president at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee agreed to a U.S. government technology competition such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next new contestants.
Investigators in the U.S. sometimes work hard to gain government approval, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking over the educational authorities; it is the industry", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring experts from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. support its AI efforts.
"I think people with PhDs in AI should be given green cards automatically", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Intellectual Property Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides people in higher education projects with the same funding as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide to U.S. researchers, but the quality of education services is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense created the Intelligence Network, which should bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a new technology called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. bill to create the National Intelligence Security Council has been in limbo for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonians pushed for the appointment on Sunday and it will be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a long-standing dispute between Greece which has blocked its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, and insists that its mountainous neighbourhood name reflects its territorial claims, has blocked its entry into NATO as well as the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on a new comparative name, but rivals are the capital and argue that the change will damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's largest Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be able to contest the election, and again the anti-corruption media has cast doubt on whether the candidates will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required for the election to be valid.
The question on the nomination form read:  Supporting NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement between Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that should be paid to follow the accession of more countries such as the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to lay my hands on the future of our country, for the youth in Macedonia to be able to live as they want under the protection of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite not being legal, members of the full legislature have said they would respect the results of the election to make it more relevant.
The name change would require two-thirds majority in the legislature.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of crime as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I can't give up because of my children, our situation is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, elected mayor of Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the nomination in Macedonia for the name change of the country which will open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small platform, and is leading a seat in front of the small chamber set up by those who want to block the election.
"We are with NATO and the EU, but we want to enter by mountain, not by the working route", Kavadarkov said.
We are a country with no money, but we have mountains.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look for others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian mix.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO", Zaev said after completing his paper.
He said that the result of ee will be certainty of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Parliamentary Review Centre said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the election - less than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would.
For the election to be successful the candidates must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat in the election would mark the first major setback for the government's policy and Western support since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero overtakes all of Brighton's defenders for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lost to Brighton's defender in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the process.
He ran through three Brighton defenses, before breaking into the open field.
Aguero saw himself surrounded by men in green shirts.
He moved one defender before escaping several others at the head of the Brighton box.
Then he threw the ball in his left hand, finding Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who then kicked it to pass Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a single shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about it for 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League win.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the Brighton field in the game.
He sent a beautiful ball to the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched him a few times before he led Sterling to the main post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net before slipping out of the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the first leg of the Champions League at 12:55 pm, on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to meet spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals out of the winner's race, there is nothing left to do to get another start.
But major leaguer Scherzer is looking to make a big step up to Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a winner's game outcome for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rochies clinched at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still look to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to pursue, at least we can play knowing that the circle here in Denver is in the middle of a crowd and the other teams will be playing at the highest level of any team I meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be part of that?
The Nationals are still waiting to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is believed that Scherzer has joined the situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, with the practice session on Thursday, will play on Sunday is his off time.
The Washington veteran is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a public rally in West Virginia
The president pointed out another way in the situation involving Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court where he was talking about the need for a Republican ticket in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done may be ruined in November.
Five weeks remain before one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I don't go out but I go out so I'm everywhere and fighting for the very good guys", he said.
Trump continued, "If you see one of the most violent rebels is the Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are determined to revive by any means possible, you see, their heart, the evil practice.
They don't care who they wrong, who they have to rise to for power and control, that's what they want power and control, we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were on a march to "block and block".
"But you saw over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, angry, bad and untruthful".
He named top Democrat Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein of the House Judiciary Committee, which received a huge outcry from the crowd.
 Remember the answer?
Have you opened the book?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I thought one - there's the worst show - the worst show I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer talking about the spread.
He does not accept opinions
When the Momentum activists in my local politics put their hands together to silence me, it was no joke.
Look, being the latest in a line of Labour MPs has been said to be unacceptable - just for the sake of expressing our opinion.
As my colleague in the legislature Joan Ryan got the same attitude because she was firmly anti-Semitic.
In my case, the anti-corruption commission criticized me for rejecting Jeremy Corbyn.
And the need for a fair national economy, national security, and Europe, in other words the same problems that Jeremy used and disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be complete and fruitful".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were usually like that.
Sadly today, it is not the voice of the majority and the politics of "goodwill, calm" that believes that promises are things that have long been forgotten if, indeed, they are ever begun.
It is a very significant fact that there is no tolerance of diversity in Labour politics, and again any opinion is being decided whether it will be accepted in the political system.
This started as soon as Jeremy became CEO, and my colleagues, with whom I thought I shared a political understanding, began to expect that I would immediately reverse course and take positions with which I would not agree in any way - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - he will not spread my words - there is a great deal of public outrage and immediately thereafter a public outcry with calls for removal, criticism of the centre-left, and being told that I should not be in Labour politics.
But I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am still favored over some of my colleagues because of the comments I have received and they are often politically motivated.
I have a feeling of efficiency and determination of those colleagues who get criticism of a person's race or race every day but they don't run.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is how negative criticism has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party should learn the lesson of patience.
The truth is that we are no longer the debate about dispersal, nor the principle of no confidence or the change of electoral law, the debate about the elections.
I have had a lot of advice over the last two years telling me to stay down, not to talk too much then I won't have any problems.
But that's not what I'm about to do politically.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a student, spurred on by the Thatcher government, which left my classroom in a state of disrepair, I have wanted to lead first and foremost in a good social service for those who need it most - whether I am a minority leader or a government minister.
I had not hidden my political affiliation before, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would be confused about my legal position and the areas I disagree with the current government.
To those who supported the bill on Friday, all I can say is that while the country's impending Brexit will have a negative impact on many of our families, businesses and social services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my support for the Labour leadership.
But in fact the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my designers, or the Labour Party and they are not: I am content to serve you and promise that no amount of risk reduction or political speeding up will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr and the undefeated runner-up
Two tests and a late arrival have ruined the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr should win in today's exciting Tennents Premiership.
Now they are at the top of the table, only one team has not won ten championships.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and their better chances, which upset the home side, and manager Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have tried our best so far, we have not won, so we are very happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented:  Thanks to Ayr, they took more time than we did.
A 14-minute test by Grant Anderson, completed by Frazier Climo, with Ayr in the lead, was given a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was left out for the match by the Warriors, giving Melrose a chance to make the numbers help, but Jason Baggot scored an unfinished try in the final.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just at half-time, he scored and completed the only try to make it 17-5 for Ayr in the second half.
But Melrose started the second round well and Patrick Anderson's test, which Bagoot completed in the lead, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was a big time loss for the heavy injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was sent off, and at the start of the tour, Ayr went on to score a try against Stafford McDowall, which Climo finished on top.
Ayr vice-captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, Melrose made another man of value with the unsuccessful trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of the Great Fire season.
The home team returned, and even after Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking a Climo out, outside the penalty line, MacPherson was lying behind Ayr's problem-facing opponent.
Climo turned it on, as he did a little later in the relay, as Kyle Rowe grabbed a shot in David Armstrong's box and sent out second baseman Gregor Henry for the team's fifth home try.
The famous Still Game is looking for a new job in the restaurant industry
Still Game's Ford Kieran wants to join the management team after it is revealed that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old played Jack Darvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, meaning Kiernan is set to live after Craiglang comes to an end.
By accurate record list, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The man declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun reporter compared Kiernan to wanting to get involved in the "prosperous Glasgow restaurant business".
The river is ours: Bolivia's circular land and hopes for court to reopen the way to the Pacific
The naval headquarters in La Paz is packed with sailors.
Public buildings and waving big blue flags.
Naval ports from Titicaca to the Amazon are full of anchors: The river is ours by nature.
Restoring it is a task.
Across the Bolivian coast, memories of the Chilean spill in the 19th century's worst environmental disaster still linger - as does the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
The forecasts are perhaps the highest in a decade, as Bolivia faces a foreign embassy decision on prostitution on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is now encouraged, united and calm, and looking forward to the outcome with optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Most Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will investigate the interests of the Bolivian claimant and - after decades of favorable hearings - Chile is forced to negotiate a free-flowing sea route for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the fascinating Bolivian president - who is facing a tough fight for re-election next year - also has much to depend on Monday's decision.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he vowed last August.
But some analysts believe that the court may not reach a decision that will favor Bolivia - and that little will change if they do.
The legislature in the Netherlands has the power to grant Chile territory, it explained that it will not decide the outcome of the possible cases.
The ICJ's decision coming just six months after the last hearings shows that the case is not a surprise, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in foreign law.
Far from supporting the Bolivian cause, the last four years have been a force for good.
"The issue of the river route has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales's sweetness is compared to the irritation that has become commonplace among the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point also start talking, but it will be very difficult to have a dialogue after this.
The two cities have not exchanged a representative since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, refused to consult and the court's decision was rarely expedited.
Monday will bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new era in Chilean relations and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - was using the water issue as political prop.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.
North Koreans have said that nuclear deployment will not happen unless they trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not take the lead in the proliferation of nuclear weapons if it could not have confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill their pledge at the meeting in Singapore between the leaders and the challengers.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening nuclear talks that have been stalled for more than three months after Singapore's split with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream" that continued sanctions along with U.S. sanctions and declarations of an end to the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is very careful to confirm the declaration while Pyongyang has not made any clear moves to disrupt.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is some doubt about the spread and Pyongyang's willingness to renounce the country's weapons may be seen as the only way to defend itself.
Pompeo is preparing to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion show showing the latest line and the biggest hairstyles coming High Street next to you
If you want to bring your helmet or sunscreen out, look elsewhere.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a bad headgear for their SS19 collection at the Street Art Festival in Paris.
Instagram has been flooded with amazing hats this summer, but the designers have sent their amazing designs in a very narrow way.
Valentino's unique hat is a striking badge cap that is attached to the base of the hat as wide as the wings that cover the heads of the models.
Other oversized items include gold-plated spoons, kissing caps and a spoon - but they don't give your head heat.
Thom Browne also showed a mask and a sense of horror - just in time for Halloween.
Most of the beautiful masks had a curved lip and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One design resembles a full-length scuba suit with a snorkel and glasses, while another resembles a melted glass of ice cream.
But if you continue with the high-heeled suit - you are in luck.
Experts predict that the huge covers could reach highways near you.
The straw hats come directly from the La Bomba, a straw hat with a two-step-wide bottom that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A consensus that the hat was not suitable for use posted on social media sent another major production to the streets - painting the beach side of a large lawn until the model wore a swimsuit.
A hot orange raffia bag, decorated with thin raffia and fitted with a clean leather, is a unique feature of Jacquemus's SS19 collection at La Riviera and Paris Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags reach high trajectory for next summer - as the designer has already made such a big impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the indigenous peoples of the world
The Scottish Independent Schools set the record for the most academic achievement, and this was furthered in 2018 with excellent test results, which are measured by individual and team achievements in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With a growing population of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to delivering the highest standard of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for future and higher education, their chosen profession and their status as global citizens.
As the education sector can adapt and implement the curriculum of higher education, we see new languages being developed that are more relevant to the topic of choice required in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he knows, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, that goes to his heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English when we try to establish relationships and trust between people from other countries.
Starting from the recent test results of this year, we can see that language is finishing on the competition table with the highest qualification score among the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved A High.
Data, collected from 74 participating schools in SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved A High in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German readers, 69 per cent of French readers and 63 per cent of Spanish readers achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people to develop in the future.
Language now, as a subject choice, is seen as equally important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Institute for Performance and Skills found that employer factors impeded them from filling job opportunities, with 17 per cent attributed to language skills deficiencies.
So often language skills are also essential for young people to prepare themselves for their future careers.
As many job opportunities may require language, these skills are important in the business world.
Whatever profession a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have great benefits in the future because of having long-term skills like this.
Being able to communicate instantly with people from abroad will put a multilingual person in front of an immediate audience.
With YouGov's survey of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak enough foreign languages to chat, with French being the only language with a flat percentage, 15 percent.
This has led to investing in language education now essential for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in the economic and social spheres, will help children by providing them with better opportunities and a more meaningful job.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in language and teaching.
Some schools will focus more on new languages, while others will teach languages seen as most important for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preference, there must be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating an environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It is undeniable in today's, global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of society, and so this should be reflected in education.
Of course, a new language should be seen as a foreign communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, which is unique and preferred for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well.
John Edward was President of the Scottish Independent Schools Conference
Lebron will make his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The excitement is coming to an end for fans waiting to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers manager Luke Walton has said that James will participate in the preseason game on Sunday between the Denver Nuggets and San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet known.
"It's going to be more than one but not more than 48," Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James could play minor league ball.
Following the draft earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game conference draft series.
"I don't want the early games in my current position in my career, to be preparation", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign. Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump launched several political rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five political rallies to gather Trump over the next five weeks, including friendship stops including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his own nomination for the Supreme Court open, Trump hopes to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the Senate when the Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign tonight, and how to watch it online.
The Trump campaign rally of Wheeling West Virginia is set for 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump campaign of West Virginia online, below via live video on Youtube.
Trump may be referring to this week's debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been mired in controversy over sex allegations and the anticipated Senate vote held for nearly a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of many of these parties is to help the Republicans in the tough November elections gain support.
So, President Trump's campaign said the next five-week campaign is about "calling in paid donors and sponsors", as Republicans try to preserve and expand their control over the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The Senate is critical to his plan, so the president will visit as many cities as possible, as we enter the political era", a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Wheeling Arena, the evening party is likely to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey, who is moving in with the investigation.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will come to promote him in the investigation", said Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed age to fight to keep hope and enter the singles final on Sunday
After three rounds of one-sided play, Saturday afternoon's four-man event may be the Ryder Cup of choice.
The power of movement is a completely discovered game strategy but it is believed by the players, which is often misunderstood in this type of puzzle.
So where would they say the power is now?
"They went with six points and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little encouragement, I think", Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 still to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, felt they had little air on their shoulders and had a lot of incentive, and not the least of which was the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played games together all day, and each would boast three out of four points.
Spieth was injured from a tee shot to the back of the head and was walking like a baby.
Anurag's roar became more intense as his own round progressed, scoring the necessary ball to keep the fourth game on the same line as he and Thomas moved with two strokes after two strokes.
The kind of scream he met with in the push that gave them a win at 15, the kind that tells you he believes the Americans are not out of this.
"You have to look inside and miss your own game", Spieth said.
It is the only thing that all gamers have now.
18 to mark.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, and the story of the Ryder Cup is undeniable.
The beautiful but unexpected union of Europe is four out of four harmless.
Moliwood were the only untied link on Saturday afternoon, but they scheduled the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
The blow, and the energy coming and going from the noisy crowd proved to be the players to beat on Sunday, which would have no other notable player who could lead to a European victory as the sun sets at Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to do both at the same time in different slots.
The glory of Europe had not yet arrived, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia in a two-man football match in the morning, after being paired with Alex Noren.
One pass and two hits in nine at-bats put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Two-man and four-man football is a surprise to watch because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy changes so quickly.
Europe has played well as a team so far and with a clear lead until the final day but the four-man event showed that the USA team has a fighting age that some, especially the Stateside, are disputing.
Europe 10-6 to advance to the Ryder Cup final
Europe will be looking to make a big push into the Ryder Cup final after a 10-6 loss to the United States in the two-man and four-man Saturday.
The two inspired by their spirit, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over Tiger Woods in a hard-fought effort, to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in pursuit of retaining the trophy they had lost to Hazeline two years earlier, continued to beat the Americans hard in the two-man game in the morning, winning the match 3-1.
The US fought hard in the four-man event, winning in two sets, but they could not reduce the number of wins.
Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 individual rounds on Sunday to keep their trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while with Molinari, named Molliwood after a special weekend was the pair's four-point win in their first four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the one-on-one, they combined to beat Woods and new American champion Bryson Dechambeau by 5&4.
Woods, who hung himself with two strikes on Saturday, showed his skill in striking but has thrown 19 of 29 balls in one-two shots and four in seven innings repeatedly.
Justin Rose rested from the two-man early morning game, and returned to join Henrik Stenson in a four-man 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not get as much as they wanted, even on a windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took the flag for the United States on Saturday with two points.
They won a hard 2&1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the two-man ball and came back to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in the four-man, having lost in the opening two rounds.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to lose in a one-on-one round, though as cup holders, a Furyk team only needs to score one run, who runs to retain their trophy.
After two days of fighting, the attack on Sunday seemed to have outpaced them.
North Korea says it will not disarm without approval
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions create a lack of trust in the United States and that there is no way the country would ever abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told an international conference that the annual General Assembly in North Korea had taken "very significant steps" last year, such as halting nuclear weapons and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we did not see his next comment from the U,S he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in the security of our country, and in this situation, there is no way we can first lay down our arms.
While Ri reversed North Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to pursue a "nuclear disarmament" program under which North Korea would benefit as it participates in a small-scale program, his remarks are significant because he did not immediately reject the nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri pointed to the remarks made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the sitting U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to discuss the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged security for North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disarm its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for easing the tough international embargo on North Korea.
The U.S. has stuck to nuclear-weapon-proofing and increased its recommendations through sanctions to achieve their goals in a credible way, and has further questioned the declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that understanding and restriction will bring us down to our knees is the dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that progress is not enough to swallow up our insecurities.
Ri did not comment on the plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting announced by the U.S. official at the United Nations that week.
Instead the minister mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the parties involved in the nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this conclusion.
Even so, Ri's voice has changed dramatically from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korean rockets to hit the U.S. capital were impossible, to the point that Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a killing mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year called for the "complete destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to follow the disarmament process, but said there was still so much work to be done that the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea ceased its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame set for this, saying Whether it takes two years, three years or five months- it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should give Pyongyang credit for its actions.
Nevertheless, U.S. Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions will continue unabated until we achieve complete, ultimate nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council has jointly pushed for a North Korean embargo since 2006, in a bid to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and later told him that he would come to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there was no future, only to be rejected by North Korea within hours for violating a similar anti-terrorism law.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its minefields and nuclear facilities if the United States complies with the deal.
He said Kim told him, "The appropriate course of action that he is seeking is the security assurances Trump has given him in Singapore and the further improvement of relations between Washington and Singapore".
Harvard students studying while on vacation
The study he witnessed at Harvard University this year caused students to sleep through the night, challenging the tradition of waiting to study all night.
A researcher found that students at the world's first university often do not know enough and come to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a senior fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital organized the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the study after giving a lecture on the consequences of not sleeping while studying.
After that a young woman came to me and said: Why is this being told to me now, at my old age?
He said no one had ever told him the value of sleep - which surprised me. he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students how the benefits of proper sleep and exercise can help them with their education and sports, and improve their overall fitness.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and the university's vice president of health services, said the university decided to launch the study after it was discovered that students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The lesson lasted an hour and included a series of workshops.
In one section there is a bedroom scene, where students fold coffee cups, t-shirts, sports shoes and paper to inform them about the effects of the sun and how sleep deprivation affects sports programming, in addition to the bedtime program.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation increased the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and stroke.
The school map has a dialog box, thus helping participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know that he will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the ability to know - just as you have the ability to know the health consequences of smoking choices, Professor Czeisler added.
The tradition of staying up all night, he said, coupled with new technologies and increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, healthy sleep should be the student's weapon against the stress, fatigue and hunger, he said - even if the insert is not inserted, sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, making them hungry more often.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physics biologist, helped Professor Czeisler organize the study, having taught his class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and stimulated his thoughts to push for this education for all schools.
Next, he hopes to ask students who have completed elementary school to complete a similar course before entering the school.
Professor Czeisler advised students to think about wearing a watch for when they want to go to sleep, and when they want to wake up, and also be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screen light and LED light, which can disrupt your body's behavior, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal Menga scored against Gerrard's
Rangers suffered a painful injury as Dolly Menga's shot to the side of Steven Gerrard was dispersed in their 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win on the road since a 4-1 defeat in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager with eight points clear of the Ladbrokes Premiership top-flight, Hearts.
Menga scored before the seventh minute of the half, and the Rangers without a stimulus didn't seem to be able to score.
With Rangers relegated to the sixth tier, Linvingston climbed to the third tier and finished only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be a future problem for Rangers after Calum Spencem's player was treated for a head injury, after a review from the visitors' side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that went through Ayr to the next round of the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, meanwhile, went with a 11 Livi, which robbed the Hearts of a point last week, and would have liked his strong team to have followed their opponents everywhere.
Rangers may have been the best catchers but Livingston was the best with the ball they had and made a difference.
They should have scored in the second minute after Menga's first small kick sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGrego's goal, but the midfielder missed his big opening.
Keaghan Jacobs' shot met goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his team-mate goalkeeper Alan Lithgow was only able to throw it behind him.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than there was confidence as the team drove into the third round.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty in the 15th minute after a draw with Steven Lawless but the manager Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers only managed to get into the post twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly suffered no injuries in the head-butt by Lassana Coulibaly and the unsound shot by Ovie Ejaria.
While the 34th minute goal by the Levies may have been a fluke, no one can say that it was a failure just because of their efforts.
Again the Rangers could not touch Jacob's deep throat.
Scott Arfield was unimpressed with Declan Gallagher's delivery to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for his dismissal.
Gerrard reversed in the break as he used Ryan Kent to replace Coulibaly which made an immediate impact, as the flanker shot Morelos but Kelly's good run ran away from where he was coming to block.
But Livingston continued to keep the visitors playing their favourite games, while Lithgow and Halkett played regularly.
Holt's side managed to extend their victory in the final but McGregor eventually fought back and rejected Jacobs, before Lithgow took the lead and kicked the ball to the side.
Rangers defender Glenn Middleton complained about a penalty that came late in the game against Jacobs but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanak: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Today is a page from our Sunday morning almanak: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Read ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhem Hans was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the amount of radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Scale.
A longtime scientific base, the Geiger Horse was later the basis for a new breed, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado". Its characters are not as well known as the cowherd scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What on earth is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger scale, used to detect the presence of minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on the headset, you can hear the atomic effects of radioactivity in the ground receiver.
Evans: Say, it is happening now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name is yet to be made.
New vaccine could teach the immune system to detect damaging cells
New vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill harmful cells
Antibodies teach the immune system to identify damaging cells as a treatment.
This method involves extracting the immune cell from the patient, and then transforming it in the laboratory.
They can detect and reverse the protein that is common in many plant diseases
Testing of vaccines has shown satisfactory results in patients with various viral infections.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify damaging cells, had her ovarian cysts go away for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cell from the patient, converting it in the laboratory to a protein common to many viral infections called HER2, and then returning the cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland, said: Our findings indicate that we have a satisfactory vaccine.
HER2 inhibits the growth of many germline diseases,including germline diseases of the breast, ovaries, breast and duct tissue, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A technique similar to removing immune cells from a patient and then teaching them how to detect germ cell infections has worked in treating a specific form of osteoporosis.
Kanye West Went on a Fury Talk Tour with Trump, Dressed in a MAGA Hat, After Appearing on SNL.
Failed
Kanye West shouted at the club during Saturday Night Live after he finished his stunt performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After playing his third song that night, the Ghost Town hit "Make America Great", he went on to slander Democrats and declare his support for Trump.
A lot of times I've had conversations with a white person, and they say: How can you like Trump, who hates black people?
Indeed, if I were affected by the prejudice against blacks, I would have left America long ago.
SNL opened the show with a bit of humor featuring Matt Damon, as the Hollywood star defended Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Congressional Judiciary Committee on the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not airing, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the West-infuriating documentary on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to bully the West by spreading the message.
Again, West told the audience that he was disappointed in the backyard about his hat.
They spoke badly of me in the backyard.
"Don't wear the hat and leave".
They were rude!
And they said again, I'm in a deep space. he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued.  Do you want to see the mystery? says he's going to wear his superman suit, which means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His remarks sparked outcry from viewers of the show at least twice and SNL staffers made a disappointed face, Variety reports, with one person telling the letter: The whole theater was silent.
West was introduced as the final replacement for Ariana Grande, who was predeceased by her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West put many people in a confusion by wearing a dress like Kalama Perrier wore to the song I Love It.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of the most passionate people: DO NOT TRY TO STOP THE WORLD.
But voice actress Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just who she is, and this is pretty cool.
But I choose NOT to give a benefit (by buying his music or clothes or sponsoring his art) to someone who I believe is sharing and expressing a harmful belief in society.
He was free.
So we, too,  he added.
Before the film, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was "the person who was previously known as Kanye West".
He was not the first actor to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has since replaced Snoop Lion, and fellow rapper Prince, who changed his name to Prince and is also a well-known actor.
Suing for attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast pub.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, a police official said.
The defendant was expected to appear in Belfast's lower court on Monday.
The Publications Office will review the documentation and the contents of the book.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has quit after a job with a bad guy
Kit Harrington is best known for his portrayal of Jon Snow in the HBO thriller Game of Thrones which is based on the old-fashioned concept of color.
But the actor, 31, has rejected the concept of heroes, saying that this type of screen acting means boys will think they need to be tough before they get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes "something is broken" and asked how to deal with the problem of a bad man's job in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who is also married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she was "very concerned" about touching the issue.
"Personally, it affects me a lot, now - where have we gone from work to manhood?" he said.
What are we teaching boys as they get older, in terms of the problems we see today?
Kit believes that theater contributed little to the increased role of the male negative, thanks to the male characters in the film.
He continued: What is the received and the taught?
What is taught on the screen, and in the crowd, that makes boys feel they should be this part of a man?
I think that's the big question in our time - how are we going to change it?
Because clearly something is wrong with our boys.
In the interview he admitted that he would not do the opening or sequel of Game of Thrones if the show came to an end next summer, saying that he and the horse fighting franchise were done.
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's live-action True West which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this movie, so in that way she gave me my family future, and my life to go on.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit imitated, and Jon Snow loved, winning an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Covid: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% reduction in the number of its citizens with HIV and Leukemia.
More than 820,000 people in the city have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of these new words are sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China due to the blood of infected people who have been infected.
But the number of HIV infections in this way has dropped to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of HIV and Hepatitis cases has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains high.
Due to the country's safety standards, research studies predict that up to 70-90% of gay men will eventually marry.
Many of the infections are caused by not having adequate sexual contact in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to develop a vaccine for HIV, ozurumba, as part of its efforts to combat the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee leaked GOP lawmakers' data, denouncing "bad night" and "conspiracy predictions"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that an employee of her had leaked the personal information of three Republican U.S. lawmakers to Wikipedia's lawmakers page.
The Los Angeles Democrat emphasized that the accusations were made by the ultra-right wing and the website owners.
"Hate, hate, and hate", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained the home address and phone number for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The message appeared online on Thursday, anonymously posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate debate on sex charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came after three lawmakers questioned Kavanaugh.
Standards security sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate reported that the IP address used to identify where the message was broadcast was associated with the Waters company, and released information that was reported by Waters employee Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and completely hateful", Waters continued.
My employee who has been compromised in his identity, personal information and security due to these fraudulent and false allegations - has no involvement in the dissemination of the information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and completely hateful.
Waters's statement prompted immediate criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This was a furious denial, wrote Fleischer.
This means that there is no spirit-like Lawgiver.
They should not be angry when someone is wrongly accused.
They should not be in doubt.
They should not question the accuser's motives.
They should be calm and calm.
It came as Fleischer assessed Waters's actions and the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to deprive Waters of his seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true", he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that his company has already called the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"We will see that those who did this will be exposed, and they will be held accountable for all their harmful and terrible actions against the man and all my servants.
Johnny English Strikes Again - an interview with the comedy mystery film Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to seek the Brexit need in any new British-themed film, and this is as relevant as the Johnny English comedy-drama - which was originally made in 2003, and then returned in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Does the comedy of how stupid we are become our new marketing tool?
Even the blind-eyed, plastic-faced idiot Johnny English has reworked his ability to promote a second act - his name more than anything indicates that it is a comedy invention designed for non-English-speaking parts of the country.
He is indeed a piece of undercover work that is nevertheless imitated intricately, with a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and the shadow of the man putting on a voiceover theme to Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
The plot revolves around the traveller and international undercover man Atkinson who is framed in what Barclaycard TV advertisements have forgotten, leaving a mess behind.
There are one or two good moments in this new JE.
I liked Johnny English approaching the plane with his old uniforms, his helmet pulled by a razor.
Atkinson's gift for visual comedy was remarkable, but the humor was not strong and overblown, and even the "unfunny" films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now have a sense of humor in them.
The comedy seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me the Johnny English tour has no special plot and its purpose as a silent film of Atkinson, the character of Bean.
The main focus of the article now is that Great Britain is in a crisis.
An unauthorized hacker hacks into Britain's most secretive intelligence network, exposes all the intelligence agents at work, and confounds the intelligence agent at work - a minor event for Kelvin Eldon.
It was the last for a troubled, arrogant president who had lost all political support: Emma Thompson tried her best to make this event more like Teresa-May's but still had nothing on the books to work with.
His security advisors told him that since all his intelligence agents were known, he would bring out a retired man.
That means Johnny English is opening up the wrong door himself, who is hired as a teacher in a rich school, but gives lessons that are not in school how to be a secret agent: literally a character here, as English gave the secret school style School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for giving the direction of the coup and was again joined by his second suicide bomber in the Bough Massacre, Ben Miller.
Bough has been married, linked to a naval gunnery officer, is a Vicki Pepperdine-style drunken affair.
So with the ever-destroying Batman and Robin Her Majesty's Secret Service is back, she meets Olga Kurylenko as the good-looking Ophelia Bulletova.
Now, the president is getting into the magic of a tech-rich man, who claims he can solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta is Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embarked on a journey of their own ridiculously funny game: pretending to be a cook, they set fire to a French restaurant; they caused a riot by putting themselves in the Volta cruise ship; English sparked confusion as he tried to use Virtual Reality's headset to identify Volta's room.
The last one was made with everything, but with all the fun and games, there was a small children's TV in all the things.
It is not at all extreme.
As with other Johnny English films, I didn't hesitate to wonder: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a program that would effectively showcase his talent?
Labour denies they are planning to allow Britons to work four days a week and receive five-day pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a plan to make changes that would see Britons working four days a week and getting paid for five.
The group demands that CEOs transfer assets they have saved from employees through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them a day off.
The workers will be paid three days a week and will receive the same salary.
The speakers said that this concept would be in line with the objectives and economic strategy of the association to make it more workable.
The Trades Union Congress has proposed a four-day week as a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party spokesperson told the Sunday Times: It is expected to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
It will not happen immediately but working four days a week is the aim of the union in line with the economic adjustment plan to fit the workers and the productivity aggregate of the union.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support the idea, as the Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 election season.
The Labour Party does not currently support the cause as a party, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: Four-day work week is not a proposal of the party so the party does not consider it.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to set out his vision for change and the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he had decided to take back control from the "leaders of unknown companies" and "the major beneficiaries" in the lifestyle industries.
The shadow chancellor scheme also means that water industry shareholders may not get their full capital, for the Labour government may make deductions on the basis of wrongful intentions.
It also announced plans to bring employees on board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would transfer 10 per cent of the total value of ordinary companies to employees, who could receive a capital gain of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 minutes whether the FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about the agency's findings that could change the minds of Republican lawmakers and withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could release any information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I guess, yes", said Kennedy.
I was told that when I joined the debate, I was told, I was told to speak to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, when the accusation came out, and said, "Did you do it?
It is uncompromising, it is decisive, and it is unquestionable.
Graham's vote, however, is as it was written.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, that he will take a strong charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know why but I know this: Brett denies it so strongly", Graham added, extorting Christine Blasey Ford.
None of those who were called believed him.
She is now 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What Is the Global Citizen Program, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Trafficking?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring some of the most iconic and stunning lineups performing, with the same amazing goal; to stop global starvation.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people gather in Ama Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the anti-poverty program by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival which was announced in 2012, is a branch of the Global Poverty Project, an international policy advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you prefer to pay for tickets), attendees will have to do some work, either do something like volunteer, send the mayor an email, make a phone call or any other useful way to raise awareness of their intention to stop the attendance.
But, how does Global Citizen succeed when they have only 12 years to implement its goals?
The idea of giving people free tickets, is this a legitimate way to get people to call the factory, or is it just another form of what's called kliktivizm - people who think they have something special they're really doing by signing up for an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have raised 19 million from its supporters, and is working towards achieving various goals.
He said that these developments have helped to get international leaders to announce commitments and projections of over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group noted a pledge that 390 levels starting with its production, at least $10 billion were distributed or measured in cash.
The same forecast estimates that the savings have affected 649 million people worldwide.
Some pledges including Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based partnership of funders and volunteer employers helping children grow into what they will be, pledged Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With support from the UK government, donors and foreign governments, and Global Citizen like you, we will celebrate the injustice of malnutrition as a message of support and heightened awareness. Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 production units were completed, calling on the U.K. to improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will use the nutrition aid to reach 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of his FAQs on the internet, asking, What makes you think we can stop the graffiti?
Global Citizen answers: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and get discouraged.
But, as the political struggle for human rights and anti-apartheid has happened before us, we will win, because we are stronger and more united.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use Navy for blockade to prevent Russian energy transfers- State Secretary
Washington may or may not use its Navy to block Russia's ability to enter markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has confirmed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke accused Russia's involvement in Syria - famously, where it was operating in response to a coup by the legitimate government - of being a fraudulent way to monitor the new energy market.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to trade energy as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe", he said.
But depending on the worker, there is still a way to fight it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that our waterways are open, if necessary, closed, to ensure that their power is not wasted", he said.
Zinke was speaking to the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that has established itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, finding that the two were the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is, based solely, on leasing and re-selling fuel", he said, while pointing to Russia as a "coalition of terrorists" with an economy based on fossil fuels and waste.
These statements come as the Trump administration tries to boost the export of crude oil to Europe, replacing Russia, which is still cheaper for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to push Germany out of the "unfortunate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, based on Trump, made Berlin the target of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to increase the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just a project for the economy.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's extreme isolation from the plan is solely due to economic reasons and is a poor strategic plan.
"I believe we agree that energy cannot be a tool for negotiation, consumers should choose their own partner", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been met with a positive response from Germany, which also expressed its support for the plan.
Germany's ruling industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from Europe's energy policy and the city-country agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very concerned when the third country is focusing on our energy transfers", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said, following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be looking very closely at running for president in 2020, Massachusetts legislator says
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be very cautious about running for president, following a midterm election.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren also announced that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which put women in charge", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, much attention will be paid to the presidential election.
Warren met with President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was leading the city in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren is voicing his criticism of Trump as well as his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet Warren said "we really want an FBI investigation before the election".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed many under Warren's electoral regime did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' potential voters said the legislator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted in favour of his candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of his candidacy and 48 percent against.
Major Democratic nominees have been criticized for running for the 2020 presidential nomination including incumbent Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his own decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin referred to PTSD Track Palin at the campaign of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in Sept.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through in the rehab, I can understand other families about the effects of PTSD and some of the trauma our military is going through", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her friend "Friend in the Room" and spoke of her son and others who went to war, they come back a little different, they come back brave, they come back asking if there is any respect for his fellow soldiers, airmen, and any other members of the same army, for what they have given to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, prevention and reporting of domestic violence and use of a weapon such as a deadly substance, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
City 18, D.C. prepares to challenge new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are preparing to legally challenge a new U.S. policy that does not provide protection for refugees from gang or domestic violence.
Delegates from the 18 cities and districts filed related aid cases on Friday in Washington to support the refugee movement that is fighting the policy, NBC News reported.
The full list of nominees in the August Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been released.
She claimed that she was abused by her roommate and her sons' gang, but U.S. officials blocked her asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Local attorneys who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have generated the highest numbers of asylum applicants in the U.S., as countries struggle with escalating gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. proposal overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday's statement that the new policy "ignores the local, state and international laws of the past year".
Federal law requires that any refugee complaint be decided on the basis of the evidence and circumstances of the complaint, which in such a closure is contrary to the legal process, Appeals related to assistance said.
Lawyers further argued in their filings that the policy to block immigrants from entering the U.S. was harmful to the U.S. economy, saying that they were often independent businessmen and provided the required contractors.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued immigration orders to judges, to reduce protection for refugees fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"Asylum security is available to those who flee their countries because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement.
Refugee protection is not designed to alleviate all - even the most serious - human problems worldwide.
Efforts to rescue survivors in Palu as death toll rises
For those who have survived an accident, the situation is even more difficult.
"It's very thoughtful", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her prodigious son among the refugees in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Villagers were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up items from flooded containers, trying to save whatever they could.
Hundreds of injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, are resting in front of Palu Army Hospital, where the funeral of the injured due to the strong earthquake is still ongoing.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how the tremor had hit the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
Time is not our salvation.
I think I was in a bit of a shock, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then I was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are well.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of opposition through media hate
A week after Chinese newspapers published a four-page article in the U.S. press about the prospects for U.S.-China trade relations, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to disseminate information.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday pointed to the sponsored addition of the China Daily to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling local newspaper - after he accused China of trying to meddle in the U.S. legislative election on November 6, an accusation that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election reflects what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new round of Washington's increasing backlash against China.
As it is a requirement for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in an increasing trade dispute which has led to them imposing a diversionary tax on their import markets.
China's tax hikes at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that back Trump's Republican campaign, Chinese and U.S. officials said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in his opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "Striving to defend the opposition by putting an advertisement in our newspaper.
"By spreading this hateful message, the Chinese government is taking the American cultural space that is dear to democracy and the media without repression and putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register".  by Branstad
"But looking at the media outlets on the streets of Beijing here, to see that there are so few different voices that you can't see anything really shows the different views that the Chinese may have about China's economic system in crisis, since it is the media outlets under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China planned to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are cautious of women voters ahead of the midterm election for Kavanaugh's controversial, analysts warn
As several Republican leaders have supported and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of sexism allegations, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The reaction was so high, that many Republicans had just registered their intention to continue the vote.
The materials could not be recovered, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School told The Hill about the article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning the final step made by Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation that would be sufficient to ease voter anger.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget all of tomorrow but November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and community spokesperson for the MoveOn movement said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched along the entire length of the House of Representatives where Republicans voted in the Supreme Court to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the declaration of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The zeal and spirit of the Democrats will stand out", Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no background, told reporters.
People say it has gone up; this is true.
But it can be particularly prevalent among women who live in rural areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while unpopular with the president, don't vote regularly.
Even before Ford's public confession describing sex charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts warned that outrage could arise if Republicans continued to make the endorsement.
"This has been a disaster for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the congressional elections or the last election or whether Kavanaugh was elected, it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, a Democratic nominating group, pointed to reporters.
However, Americans were divided as to who would agree with the Ford and Kavanaugh nominations, with the majority supporting the latter.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents agreed completely or partially with Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they agreed completely or partially with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably said no or no at all during his inauguration, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
After Flake's suggestion, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other allegation, made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drugged her when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court nominee of showing her power when they held a dinner party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer Announces Plans to Launch a New Internet to Join Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will chase Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new initiative of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's open source software, Solid.
Solid gives users the freedom to choose where to store their data as well as information that people can access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Inrupt was to be a global government.
"We'll do it now", he said of the new house.
It's time to make a statement.
The application uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create an online personal database or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a list of events, a calendar, a playlist as well as personal and work applications.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal databases is that it is up to the user to decide who will receive each piece of information.
The company calls it privacy through data.
Inrupt's vision, based on CEO John Bruce, is to bring the right companies, infrastructure, processes and expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company only owned Berners-Lee, Bruce, the memory from which IBM purchased it, the designers employed to work on the project and the assembly of the code that was self-published.
From this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own standalone apps using the virtual app on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team did not discuss with Facebook and Google whether they would start or leave the startup completely changed as business models were changing instantly in the blink of an eye.
 We do not collect their permission.
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide a business-friendly environment to help maintain the trust and quality of the newly developed Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a vocal voice in debating internet freedom.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain as the Founder and Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the future that has already been", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The priests were awarded the Victoria Cross WW1
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier has celebrated his 100th birthday in his home country.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann was given a break on 29 September 1918 with the raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a high-powered gunshot wound four days later proved him unfit and made him the most decorated British soldier.
Two of his grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a funeral service held in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a very special sign" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's efforts to obtain the statue.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin amidst a black cloud and amidst a large explosion from a shotgun and cannon.
He later ran into the gunmen and powered the first line forward before firing his gun alone and shooting three soldiers away.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he knew he couldn't do better but it was humbling".
He and his brother Dr James Vann added a memorial wreath after the ceremony, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was very happy with the mounted knighthood and said it was a sign of support from people who respected the strength of a true hero.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but got Peppa Pig
Imagine, staying up all night watching Bellator 206 full of people, only to be denied a chance to party.
The letter from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main card and showing it as it was happening all night on Uk on Channel 5.
At 6am, as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, the UK audience was confused to get the transformed Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted by the fact that they had to stay up all night, especially for the fight.
A Twitter user explained the change to the children's show as "a big joke".
"It was a government policy that by 6 a.m. the show was not suitable for children, so they were getting into the children's programming", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and advertising, said when asked about the show.
Peppa the Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would be working on their plans to add UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about his moves, I think we can probably fix it", Coker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we couldn't fix it until our Sunday, their Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when he changed the site, there were so many texts back and forth that they were all not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical failure.
But no, it is a matter of the government.
I promise you it will never happen again.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we're trying to satisfy the fans and then move on.
It is a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: It affects Tom Daley as a sexist
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said he grew up feeling bad about being around everyone because of his gender - but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that There is no one like him.
Speaking on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs premiere, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about the ability of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that being a father did not necessarily give him the spirit to win the Olympics.
The long-time host, Kirsty Young, has been dead for several months.
Appearing as a rejectionist on Laverne's first episode, Daley said it affected her as a "lesser" than others when she was growing up because of her "unacceptable social and sexual orientation".
He said: To this day, the feeling of inadequacy, and the feeling of being different, are the things that have given me the strength to succeed.
He wanted her to prove herself something, she said, so as not to upset everyone when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a rising LGBT activist, and with her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia she has called for many other countries to abolish homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt he was lucky to be able to live an open life without any consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US actor Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - made her a widow.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, last year but said their age difference has never been a factor.
After going through a lot during his childhood - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14, his father died of kidney disease three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone his age who had the same high and low experience as him.
The couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June- which Daley said changed his perception.
If you asked me last year, it was only about winning gold.
And, of course, there are things more valuable than Olympic gold.
My name is Robbie.
Her son, who shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not believe he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether they had booked their tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.
"I can't tell him he won't live to see it". she said.
"I held her hand as she stopped breathing and it was only when she stopped breathing and died that I accepted that she was not dying", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I know this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to force myself to swim in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no greater impact", he said.
It inspired her first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which involved her during the Olympic preparations and also shocked her.

Mickelson was left out of the Ryder Cup squad on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to change his form to avoid being a disappointing achievement.
Captain Jim Furyk replaced Mickelson, playing in the once-in-a-lifetime event for his 12th year, on Saturdays for the two-man singles and four-man doubles.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he used to be for the United States, the five-time champion spent his days being a puncher and fixing his game on the pitch in the hope of improving his condition.
He was never a consistent hitter even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old did not fit the profile of Le Golf National, where the tall, hard hitting star has not suffered long.
And even if the celebrity isn't intimidated by himself, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday will face the heavily-hit British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has partnered with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points behind, start a 12-inning game of one-on-one, start on a scorching heat, Mickelson's play could be crucial.
Furyk confided in his own person, not that he had anything else to say.
"He chose his job today carefully, he slapped me on the back and he held my hand and said, 'There will be preparation tomorrow,'" Furyk said.
He has a high self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added a lot to the squad last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but this is how it turned out and how we thought we would go.
He wanted to be in front of the crowd, like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career which is less than the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and one draw, although Furyk said his presence led to an inexplicable setback for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to make people laugh, he's a good person to have in the club room", she explained.
I think the young players were happy to play him this week, it was a great experience.
It offers more than just playing games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that the big lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that to enter the singles round on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a high score can turn out to be a very unpleasant ride.
The Dane first appeared in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the Captain's side of the Seven Ballesteros scored five points over the Americans but were able to cross the finish line only with their nose in front by a small gap, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to try to remember yourself in going to Valderrama with a big score; we went to Brookline with a big score, where we lost, and to Valderrama where we won but it was a little bit", said Bjorn, who was set to go after the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, going 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the hysteria would show me that everyone is not done with this.
You will try harder tomorrow.
Get out of there and do everything right.
This is not over until you get the mark on the board.
We had a goal, to try to win the trophy, and that was our focus.
I have said before that, I am looking at the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what is on the other side - the best players in the world.
Impressed by the hard work of his players, Bjorn added: "I can't run away from myself.
Tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow is a one-man show that comes up, and that's something different to do.
It's nice to have a partner in front of you when things are going well, but when you're alone in front of you, then you're going to be tested like a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to athletes, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, leaving your partner behind will also go to the best of your ability.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk's face-to-face numbers would have his players perform better on their own than they would with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at the end of the big day of the campaign, after leading the side to victory in Brookline before being defeated as Europe performed the Miracle at Medinah.
I remember all his speeches, he replied when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw had assembled his team in the final days.
We have 12 important matches all day tomorrow, but it would be nice to start with a strong like see in Brookline, like see in Medinah.
When he was a senior, he was a big influence in the midfield.
We arrange our lines accordingly and add our own to the style we like, well, we try to do magic all the time tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to take the lead in the fight and faced Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans at the top of the order.
I took one of these guys because I thought I had it all", Bjorn said of his one-man color choices.
Germany again moved new weapons
The new Frigate was supposed to enter service with the German Navy in 2014 to replace the older Cold War-era weaponry, but it won't be there until at least next year due to poor systems and expensive costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but initial problems followed the scope of the plan.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class four ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacements for the larger Bremen-class frigate.
It was understood that they would have a very powerful gun head, various air and naval missiles as well as some secret technologies, such as radar, infrared and sound compatibility.
Other important work involved a long repair period - it should be possible to put the new frigates into service up to two years away from the port.
After all, all this delay means that the special weapon - which is said to give Germany a chance to prove itself abroad - will be obsolete when they start operating, Die Zelt pointed out.
The F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the Navy after the manufacturers had delivered it.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media pointed to a number of minor software and hardware failures, so that the weapon was useless if exported to war.
Software deficiencies were critical as 120 pilots would pilot the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class - only half the number piloting the older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it also meant that the ship was too large to be of much service and prevented the Navy from adding upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have carried twice as much cargo as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from the bad hardware, the overall cost of the project - including the training of pilots - is also significant.
It is said that €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) of fraud has been committed - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The difficulties with the new frigates were particularly significant due to the early warning that the German Navy was in decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary security council, announced that the Navy actually no longer has any ships to deploy.
The official said the issue has accelerated over time, as older ships are being decommissioned but no vessels have been launched to replace them.
He was convinced that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the Navy.
National Trust pays attention to the secret life of the grasshopper
A new study in a Scottish Highlands farm seeks to reveal how the grasshopper uses the crust to cook.
It is hoped that the discovery will further clarify the perception and behaviour of these unique mammals and help to shape future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow the famous pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared in Daubenton and Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the camp to monitor these swarms at all times.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct roaming tests using handheld detectors.
A sound-recording analysis of all the recordings will show how often the call is made and what each species is doing.
Residential maps and registries will be created to create a complete map of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, environmental consultant for NTS, hopes the results will show the most important aspects of the habitat and how each species is using it.
This information will help to decide on the best environmental management practices such as grassland production and how best to conserve tree land for deer and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last decade.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect shelter and shelter.
Wind turbines and lighting can pose a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical safety devices used in construction, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The sparrow is certainly not a fool.
Moreover, because of their night-time feeding habits, their ears are more important than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use echo detection to find the pitfalls and obstacles in their worship.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 old houses, 38 important fields and 76,000 hectares of land in the suburbs, called the task force "very important".
There are ten trained experts who are constantly searching, searching the beds and occasionally rescuing.
The company has set up a special site in Scotland first dedicated to the Threave's field in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of butterflies.
The camp's manager, David Thompson, said that the camp was the best place for them.
"Here in Threaves, we have a beautiful area for crows", he said.
We had an old house, old trees and all the good accommodations.
But there is still much to be learned about the frogs, so our work here and in other gardens will help us understand more about what they need to survive.
He also noted the need to look for locust before designing a garden because a mother-child nest could be inadvertently destroyed, killing up to 400 women and their children, and wiping out the entire population.
It was also considered a crime to kill, torture, or harm them or to destroy their beds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to get involved.
He said: "There is still much to learn about our eagles and the many species of birds that we do not know how many there are".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegation against him a "fake news story", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers have been ready to sue the German newspaper, Der Spiegel, which published the accusation.
The former Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to keep her quiet about what happened, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live video after the allegation was announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the story a "fake news story".
No, no, no, no, no. I have to go.
What they said today, a false story, the five-time Ballo dOr winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It was a reality.
They want to be known by my name, but it is part of this work.
I was a happy and good person, the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called "unacceptable news for an investigation into his private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would receive a punitive damages for  breach of the rules in proportion to the amount of damage, is probably one of the biggest violations of privacy in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 inside the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's home, where he assaulted her by force, according to a subpoena filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo made a false statement after the allegation and told him that he was 99% real person  one percent deceived.
The publication claims that Ronaldo believes they have a sexual relationship but everyone else believes.
Mayorga also admitted that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries in the hospital, but was later persuaded to decide not to go to court because of his "fear of reprisals" and "defence of his conscience for his performance in the royal court".
The 34-year-old said she wanted the settlement to be reversed as she still felt pain from the accusation.
Ronaldo was looking to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crash, and this summer, he moved to Italy's top club, Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be sad for the future if the car manufacturers are left behind
The UK will be "saddened" if it loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "missing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the outcome of a delay in the ground if there is no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced around 150,000 vehicles last year of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota and Burnaston's general manager.
Other UK carmakers are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal as cross-border deals will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for its part, has said it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest factor in the car manufacturers' claims is the risk of a deal breaking down if no agreement is reached.
Production is carried out at Toyota on the  Come Right line, with 37-minute car parts available from suppliers, both UK and EU for its commercial vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a land dispute which the manufacturer said could lead to delays and inadequate vehicle parts.
It is unlikely that Toyota will leave more than a day's supply at their factory in Derbyshire, the company said, as production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was designed to avoid all scrutiny on the ground.
"We want to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will give us the opportunity as I say, which is not just to get the momentum right now but to also take this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that a fully successful marketing strategy should be continued.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the meantime, they are warning that the price increase will reduce the power of its pumps and eventually will lead to the dismantling of the plant.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union coordinator at the factory, said his team is very much missing: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they don't go back.
A government spokesperson said: We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
The crucial meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein may be postponed next week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of special operations Robert Mueller who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia and the blocking of the president's impeachment proceedings.
But Trump was forced to resign as the deputy chief justice, thus putting Mueller's freedom at risk, sparking a firestorm in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about wearing a speech wire to record Trump's controversial impeachment of the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid complaints that he wanted to land.
Instead, a meeting between Trump, who is at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosentein but then cut short the meeting to avoid crowding in the presence of Kavanaugh's congressional panel of judges and one of the women who accused him of corruption, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weeklong FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which fully delayed the congressional elections.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosentein meeting, he said: Don't set a date for that, it might be next week, I see that it's back a week because of everything that's happening now at the highest court in the country.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the media informed about what's happening right away.
Some reporters will pull the trigger: Sanders hasn't been the White House correspondent since September 10.
Superintendent Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of editorial was due to the disdain for the "high scores" of TV reporters, although he said: "I don't really believe they are looking for high scores".
He compared the immediate communication between Trump and the media to the rise.
The president has more interview time than any president before him, he said, adding that he did not mention any evidence: We have looked at these numbers.
Press conferences will happen, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to question the president of the United States immediately, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, you've seen us do that a few weeks ago, and that will replace the news editor when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in interviews or press conferences when there are foreign officials.
The media congregations are not unique.
In New York this week the president probably explained why, that the appearance is not good, sometimes the appearance is bad in front of the press.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit risks
The Health Secretary has written a letter for EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's appreciation and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within three months to the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the costs of the application process for EU citizens in its public sector departments.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the UK-EU negotiations and dispute settlement process has progressed, and a final decision is expected this summer.
But the UK Government is also raising its support for a no-deal scenario.
I know that this will be a time of great distress for you.
That's why I want to reiterate now my huge and respectful respect to all the staff for their help, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues come from across the EU, and beyond, bringing the experience and expertise needed to extend and improve the service of healthcare, and help patients in our communities and workplaces.
Scotland is yours, we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers coach Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after an injury caused by a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, caused by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly after halftime.
"He came to the side and threw it there", Reed said.
Trainer and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen to the area before she was placed on life support and then returned for further tests.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has emerged from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he has not yet been given details on the nature/degree of the injuries and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, second in college in red shirts, was in his first year at Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five blocks on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his league year total to 18 blocks.
Foreign businesses will still be charged higher stamp duty when buying assets in the UK
Foreign businesses will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and use the above money to help the homeless under the Tory scheme.
The move would undermine the progress of Corbyn's campaign to attract voters and grow
Stamp duty will be charged on non-taxable persons in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign businesses are facing higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - the money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
That would be seen as an attempt to undermine the progress of Jeremy Corbyn's push to attract voters and young people with promises of more cheap housing and the expulsion of those with higher salaries.
Stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the above amount will further the Government's efforts to combat housing shortages.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the existing stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced in the last two years in the second building and the buy-for-rent - could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It was determined that 13 per cent were non-UK residents and the purchase of newly built London properties, raising costs and making it difficult for those making their first purchases to make progress in the housing phase.
Most of the city's affluent areas - especially the capital - have a "vacuum town" due to the high number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the city.
The new law comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp strike to help young people get their first home.
He accused big manufacturers of keeping resources at a premium by foreclosing on land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up the share of cheap housing to address Britain's "housing shaming".
Mr Corbyn has announced a housing reform package that has attracted attention, including the management of rent and the end of evictions "without human fault".
He also wanted to give more council permission to build new buildings.
Ms May said: Last year I said I would launch my government to restore the British dream - the life that should be better for any new race.
But that meant repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it cannot be good that it is easier for people living outside the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house than British residents and foreign workers.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home is now near, and the plight of homelessness is now a reality.
Jack Ross: My greatest ambition is to take over Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said his biggest ambition is to be Scotland's leader once.
The Scot, 42, is delighted with the fight to bring back the North-East league, who are currently in the third tier of League One, three points below the top.
He went to the Stadium of Light this summer to lead St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country.
I got a cap B that was it, Ross told Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
But I grew up in Scotland and I visited Hampden a lot, and with my father as a child, it was always a draw.
The opportunity will come, though, if I do well in team management.
Those who came before Ross as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gue Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow the big names into the big leagues, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My progress this season will be measured by Can I take this team back to the Premier League?
"Because of the platform and the building of the club, that without a doubt should be in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get back there, but I can only see myself as a good fit here if I can lead the team back there.
Ross spent just three years in his managerial role, after a short spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay on the Hearts staff.
He went on to help Alloa return from relegation to the third tier, and turned St Mirren from relegation to Championship Cup victory the following season.
But Ross said he is feeling more at ease now than he was during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It could be a good connection", he thought, "to take over Alloa.
I really believe that management is better for me, than running.
It sounded bad because I had done well, lived a good life, and had some visionary good things.
But it is not easy.
You have a lot to go through each week.
I'm still going through that in terms of the complexity and continuity of the project but the management is good.
From the beginning I wanted to do management, now I do it, it mostly gives me a sense of calm, I am myself and my whole adult life.

The best time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research says
The summer heat has hit the money for the failing British pubs but has added to the problems for the restaurant business.
A bar saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA business advisers, who compiled the figures, said: "The sun is still out and England's participation in the World Cup has been long-awaited meaning that July followed a similar pattern to last June, when bars were up 2.8 per cent, except for the restaurant sector was in a major slump.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The best wine shop looks like a restaurant down the street.
The bars and food stalls suffered from the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It was as if people were going out to get drunk.
Across these bars and restaurants wine sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of RSM Entertainment and Management researcher said: These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of social events or big sports are still a big influence when it comes to shopping outside the home.
It is not likely that the restaurant industry will continue to decline, however a decline in sales of 4.8 percent per annum would be a major pain in the current debt crisis.
The long summer heat may not come at a bad time for grocers, but time will tell if the relatively good demand in August will bring some much-needed rest.
The combined sales growth across bars and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, indicating a decline in new business.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business analysis company for UK pubs, pubs and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 sites, with a combined turnover exceeding £9 billion, that's a set industry mark.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they have with their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - have a social media account that they hide from parents and teachers, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram pages
The report has raised fears of sexual content being shared
20% of students said they have a Basi account to show parents
One in five children - some under 11 - set up their own social networking accounts and hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - referrals to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being distributed.
Twenty percent of students said they also use Basi as a clean account to show parents, but also as a private one.
A mother who visited a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter saw a girl and other girls attacking her.
The survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half believing they had a private account.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: It is feared that many young people are trying to create online slots where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the contestants on the Scottish Championships chair
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated competitor, and manager Ian Beattle described the injury as a great opportunity for the team and the sport to take advantage of his experience of international football over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a great respect across the Scottish racing scene, UK and around the world, and we are sure that the racing scene in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him to their chair", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I like to work as a voice for the competition, I hope I can really help and help guide the game in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in the heats of the Olympic gold medal, is now a BBC expert, has been unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: A month ago today I got the paralysis.
He was unable to walk.
Doctors said only time would tell whether I would be able to recover or what my height would be.
It was a lot of work but I came back fully fit, learned how to walk and today I am working hard!
Thank you for the message of comfort!
Advertising of milk ransom and the discussion of mothers and cows divided online opinion
The dairy industry has divided opinion online through media and discussion of mothers and dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first "wearable milk ransom", consumer technology company Elvie launched a three-day video and music campaign to showcase the freedom the new ransom offers mothers.
Four real mothers playing in a cowshed of fried beef have phrases like: Yes, I'm sucking my milk, but you won't see any of the young If you haven't figured this out yet, these are not milk, these are my breasts.
The terror continued:  Release him, release him, I feed the little ones, release him, release him, my daughters, I give birth to milk.
However, the ad, which has already been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused problems online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes the "risks" of the dairy industry seem easy to overlook.
It was a very bad decision to use cows to spread the word about this product.
Like us they would get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only to have their babies stolen within a few days of birth, one person wrote.
Elvie's milkshake is hidden in the mother's bra and baby care (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: A great fear felt for mother as well as child.
But why aren't they used to spread the message of breastfeeding for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?
Another added Such advertising is useless.
Others spoke for the ad, and one woman admitted that the fear had made her laugh.
I think this is a very beautiful aloe.
I can buy one if I'm breast-feeding.
Redemption was just like a bull to me.
The advert was a bit of a distraction but it's there.
This is a product of great intelligence, one person wrote.
Another wrote: This is a new ad aimed at mothers who are doing the redemption (sometimes at work or in their bathroom) and find themselves asleep.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video one of the women showed that they had been dancing but there was a ransom hidden inside their bra.
The understanding that backed the ad was based on the understanding that the majority of women on lactation said they saw themselves as cows.
The Elvie's Redemption is even more complicated, completely concealed, has a strap or a handle and is hidden inside a baby-sitting bra, allowing mothers to walk around, hold their baby, and go out to unwrap.
Ana Balarin, partner at ECD and Mother commented: The Elvie Redemption is a brand new product that should be launched and inspired.
By differentiating between women in child care and cows in dairy production we want to put the dairy industry and all its struggles in focus, and show it a way that provides a fresh and home-grown feel of the greater freedom that the new industry will bring.
This was not the first time Elvie's ransom had caused a stir.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared in the street for a walk for the fashion icon Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Small-town Children Attend Camps in the Texas Panhandle
The number of child immigrants being detained has risen and although the monthly border crossing has not changed much, the Trump administration's stringent statements and policies have made it more difficult to keep children in foster care.
Traditionally, most advocates of asylum seekers have no record of themselves, fearing to infringe on their own right to stay in the country by coming forward to save a child.
The threat escalated in June, when the central authorities announced that the supporters could come with other elders of their families to hand over fingerprints, and that their data would be shared among immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has arrested several people who have applied to be sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
 Up to 80 percent of the people are supporters or a family member of supporters who are in the country illegally, many of them are illegal aliens.
So we are continuing to hunt the people, said Mr. Albence.
To process the children more quickly, officials who introduced new rules would require some to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days later, which was the standard, by the local authorities.
Most will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to request their case for legal notice before an immigration judge.
Those found to be unfit will be immediately taken out for inspection.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to be abused or harassed, which can lead to angry expressions or attempts to escape, by the housing authorities and complaints that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Proponents say the ideas are being echoed in larger buildings like Tornillo, where the baby boomers are more vulnerable and even more neglected, due to its size.
They added that taking children to the village without giving them enough time to prepare their spirits or to greet their friends could exacerbate the abuse many of them are currently experiencing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish-backed "local forces" to leave immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the foreign troops are on Syrian soil illegally, under the cover of attacking the couples, and that they will be treated as appropriate.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the congregation.
Moualem stressed that the War on Terror is over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011, while millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue this fight until we expel all Syrian refugees for two terrorist groups and any foreign presence is illegal.
The United States has 2,000 troops inside Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return, and blamed some Western countries for spreading fear and senselessness that forced the refugees to stay for too long.
"We have called for foreign teams and humanitarian organizations to start these repatriations", he said.
 They use what should be a humanitarian crisis to promote politics.
The United States and European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the rebels to end the fighting.
UN representatives said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone where the last remaining militants are in Idlib has created an opportunity for political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish decision ended the massive offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where 3 million people live.
Moualem Kazoul has also stressed that the agreement has clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action will drive out the jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will be eliminated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold the first meetings of the newly formed coalition of government and rebel groups to draft a draft war law for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the stage for the Syrian government's participation in the forum, saying that the forum's work should be limited to examining the text of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With that in mind, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as most reasonable people might expect, a coup d'état and bad behavior ends his reign in a timely manner.
What would be undeniable The ultimate fate of the most terrible president!
Now there is no sign of testing fatigue.
Since 2014, the highest-time-advertising ratings have climbed to 1.05 million clicks on CNN while it is just a little over three clicks up to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had the highest average viewership of 2.4 million, up 1.7 million over the past four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has remained at the top of the cable rankings with 3.5 million viewers at night for critical news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we understand", said Neal Baer, the star of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary becoming president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, the famous comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another idea.
He recalled a car ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would compare Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", Miss Scovell told me.
There is a recreational value in the conflict.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news reports from Washington will determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reconnect and the well-being of the global economy.
Distraction is a luxury that only the wealthy can increase.
But for now, it's beyond being a citizen and what happens when you find yourself at six o'clock watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of the head of the deep circle for his book Fear, the suit ostrich skin bomb by Paul Manafort is $15,000 (dressed with hubris, The Washington Post said) and the release of Stormy Daniels' description of Mr. Trump's bad skin.
I will never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes it look like a show is that it gives you a show every night", said Brent Montgomery, president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Pawn Stars, for the show's Trump and Changing Artists and Daily News coverage (fighting the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You should not be confused.
When I got Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees out and he was swimming along the coast of the northern tip of Kauai, but he was in the room watching MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He was not strong enough to withdraw, not as Brett Kavanaugh wanted to meet the Congressional Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court on the air.
I remember when we were doing all those silly shows in the old days, people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it means they're right.

Excluding the financial implications of the most difficult midterm election campaign for the House
It was not unusual in 17th-century Pennsylvania and the financial system, thanks to the reform of the congressional camp that two incumbents ran for the same seat.
Pittsburgh's recently renovated downtown district elected Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb was crushed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is largely confined to the new 17th district.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old park was divided illegally to favor Republicans.
The campaign on the 17th has recently started a campaign fundraiser between the two largest political sponsors, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a minor victory in the March special election that was overwhelmingly watched for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 votes.
Political experts have given the Democrats little headway.
U.S. Waits to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, but Stops
The delegates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have supported Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the executive team of the Trump Organization was fired by the partners.
State Department officials decided to withdraw American diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the recent decision to end support for Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received nearly $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development assistance and economic development.
The comparable penalties, which include the withdrawal of financial aid and the intentionally exclusive visa restrictions, should be a disgrace to the Central American nation and its level of unemployment and murder.
As the in-house meeting continued, North American and Central American officials moved to a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow up on the same rally last year that saw progress in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But before mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead, and to stop any discussion of sanctions for El Salvador immediately.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in recognition of the importance the administration places on the meetings, the delegates said.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new force or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the House debate in a confidential setting.
Their report was confirmed by an external auditor, who was close to the administration and spoke in a confidential manner.
Academic Records
The next step may be the appeal by Robert Mueller's special counsel for the impeachment of Mr Trump, which there is clear evidence of in public records.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's media and Russia were involved in his attacks on our elections.
Congress should change hands, and Mr. Trump will find himself questioning that, as he prepares to go before the electorate again, and perhaps later before a jury of his peers.
That's a lot of potential, not that I want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European allies.
There are decisions we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to overthrow Hitler, if the West would interfere and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the chance to avoid the year of the great catastrophe.
The geographical and historical sequence of the revolution, the unending struggle for democracy, will either continue or be cut short.
Americans are facing many major changes right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of much of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep trouble since the documentary, which last year, he compared to secretly recording the president and accused of being bad for the company.
Mr. Rosentein said the Times report was incorrect.
How do we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation request for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or valid - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite the clear accusations of assault and the flawed evidence?
After all, will we have a mid-year election for Congress that will keep Mr. Trump in office?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be ready for a long period of stagnation.
But I believe we will not fail, because of what we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported from Auschwitz at the same time that the Nazis took over my barracks.
He survived, fled to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on the swastika table.
Or is that my culture, how can I have real hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has high hopes for the Rapid Vienna
Rangers and host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, know that a win over the Austrians, followed by a dreaded knockout in Spain between Villareal earlier this month, will put them in a tough position to complete the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villareal but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to make serious moves.
"It's a good score for us because Villareal is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game hoping we could get something and come out with one point.
Maybe we should get a win in the end but, in summary, whoever wins is also a good result.
They seemed better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were better.
Thursday night was another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but, the crowd was with us, I am ready that we can go on and get a good result.
Last year was very difficult, with all the things that happened both my injury and the changes in the team itself but there is a good spirit about the place now.
The same game is good, my teammates have a vision; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can also move forward now, put the year of competition behind us and do well.
Women and the panic over retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people were talking to family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they had told their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to negotiate the deal", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is a good place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for caregiving if you do not discuss your needs early.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how care will be available, as those choices may be important factors in determining the cost.
Consult your financial advisor: A financial advisor can also help you to plan how to pay for those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include an existing long-term care insurance policy, a life-saving benefit-funded policy to help you cover these expenses or a personal-insurance with your own resources - if you have the money.
Discuss your legal documents: Solve legal problems at the opportunity.
Keep a health care representative on hand so that you can assign him or her to a trusted person to take care of your health care and make sure to see competent professionals in your interests if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your money.
You would hire a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to see that your bills are paid if you are unable to pay them.
Simple facts: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical accident and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and what they avoid?

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As communications were cut off, rescue workers were unable to get any information from the Donggala administrative district, the northern region of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were displaced by the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palua is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the peninsula on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a municipality extending 300 km (180 mi) along the western and northern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The administrative territory, the administrative area under the park, had a population determined at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the park, but is more prevalent in Morowali, and the façade of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongalla have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located in the middle of the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is frequently hit by earthquakes and volcanoes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake near the west coast of the Indonesian archipelago of Aceh on the Sumatra coast on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 cities, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of massive earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a violent tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing up to 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that devastated many rural areas and killed up to 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, causing damage and unrest and devastating damage to the people caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were triggered at this time, but collapsed houses killed more than 100 people.
2018: A massive earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake damaged thousands of homes and left some travelers with temporary problems.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Assault and Battery
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, and involved in a complaint of assault and resisting arrest, according to a complaint released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police complaint, when a female friend tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone from him.
Palin was arrested in Mat-Su Pre-Trial Building, held on a $500 bond, which was issued by kTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he described himself as "innocent, indeed" when his request was denied, the network tweeted.
Palin is facing a Class A felony, which means she could face up to a year in prison or a $250,000 fine.
He has been charged with a Class B felony, punishable by up to one day in jail or a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first criminal charge brought against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case was before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Affairs.
In January 2016 he was charged with assault, involvement in a crime of assault, and assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the case.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was reported missing by veterans in 2016 after her son's violence was linked to PTSD that began during her service in Iraq.
Indonesia: earthquake and tsunami killed 100
At least 384 people have died as a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks were damaged, with the dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a small outlying area of central Sulawesi which is the eastern and northern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating in public toilets showed the time of the crash.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami hit the waterfront.
Federal judges seeking death penalty for suspected terror attack in NYC
New York magistrates are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a New York terror attack that killed eight people -- the most severe sentence ever handed down in the state for any federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with driving a Home Depot truck and causing the accident on a bike path along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To demonstrate why the death penalty is valid, the jury will find Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" injured the victims, by a motion of intent to seek the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, by court order.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder with the aid of cold-blooded assault, which federal judges typically use in felony assault cases, and charges of assault and damage to a vehicle.
The attack required "intense planning and deliberation", the judges said, explaining that the behaviour Saipov used to make him "a criminal, abusive and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, torture, and destruction to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York handed down a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of two counts of murder and drug trafficking but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York city court case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being convicted of conspiring to commit treason against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of humanity in the days and months following the attack, which court documents show.
He told investigators that he was fine, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, which the indictment showed.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the city's public advocates and a representative of Saipov, said they were "deeply sorry" for the court's decision.
"We feel that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole will only further escalate the horror of the events for all concerned", Patton said.
A defence of Saipov had previously asked the judges to withhold the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be put at the head of the Brexit debate
Nigel Farage promised to rally the crowd today during the Tory protest.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should "get the heat" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs compared that to being at the head of the EU's central board.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham in the UK that he would leave if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's struggle with the idea that reuniting her deeply divided party was a sign of weakness as Remain Tory supporters joined the protest as opposed to stopping Brexit in the country.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers deal plan in order amidst the onslaught from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The coalition insists that he will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the slander - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and the apology.
Mr Bone told a Leave Means Leave conference in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He compared that Mr Farage should be made a member and given the job of the organ in the centre of Brussels.
"If he's in charge, we should leave now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: I will stand for Brexit but we should throw away Chequers.
Expressing his criticism of the EU, he said: We did not fight the world to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Boone lost the argument and public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: Alo that the British have changed their minds and want to remain is not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Most of the public did not like Chequers, the Conservatives could not vote for it, our political parties and activists did not like it, who walked the streets and saw that we were elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.
In Mrs May's speech, she said: Prime ministers are appointed when they make their promises.
Mr Farage told the assembly that the politicians should get the heat if they want to overturn the decision made in the 2016 election.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political parties", he said.
They are trying to push Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.
Message to the crowd: We want you to make one of our politicians, who are in the forefront of Brexit, see the heat.
"We, and the mass troops of this country that gave us the victory over Brexit, will not rest until we are once again a free, self-governing, dignified United Kingdom.
On the other hand, the Remainers traveled from Birmingham before the convention and spent two hours in the city square.
A small rally of Tory and Brexit activists has just kicked off this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis blamed the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered by using a party ticket to open the parliament.
"There are people who tell us they have a ready IT system and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for land and no-frills, for free and no-frills business in Ireland", he added.
It is a big one.
There is no such thing as a real Brexit, he added.
Warren is strongly in favor of the White House for running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a conference room in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He has been at the center of speculation that he might extend Trump's campaign in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th gathering of local residents using the synagogue system since Trump took office.
The person asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, but that includes a woman in charge.
Don't get caught up in the LSU Sims' crap
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said Saturday that a man has been arrested on suspicion of the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They uploaded a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the photo.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, admitted to being there, armed, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident, taken to the jail at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior at Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has already qualified for the World Cup after a one-shot lead gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and on Saturday the Mercedes team passed a rule that would have a major impact on the race side.
At first, Bottas got off to a good start, narrowly missing Hamilton on the sand as he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to hug his teammate.
Vettel got into the pit first and let Hamilton into the lockdown at the end of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after suffering a leg-to-leg injury that forced the Ferrari driver to stop deliberately opening the pit for fear of straining after a push-up to make a third lap.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid, finishing seventh on the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He continued to stay ahead for much of the race as he grabbed his tire to chase a fast finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth.
He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his speed with eight laps remaining as Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all week and was a very gentle man as I was told.
The same team has done a special job to have the first and second, Hamilton said.
That Was the Most Foul Language
President Donald Trump blamed Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not disclosed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's family accused of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not immediately address the evidence presented by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that the events in the Senate showed that people were cruel and corrupt.
"The same thing can happen and the same beautiful thing is happening a few days ago in the Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, angry, and deceitful", he said.
When you see the opening and the opening and they say oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you recall?
Dianne Feinstein, have you been exposed?
Remember the answer... you opened the book - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I have not yet opened it".
Well, wait a minute.
We have already... No, we have not, he added, in the speech of the legislator.
Feinstein sent a letter explaining Ford's allegations to Kavanaugh last July, but it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the revelation came from his office.
"I have not covered up the charges against Dr. Ford, his story has not been released", Feinstein told the congregation, The Hill reported.
He asked me to take him secretly, and I did according to his request.
But the refusal was not good for the president, who said on the night of the rally: I'll tell you, this is the worst language.
He may not have done it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen.
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court nominee, one of three women who have filed assault charges, the president compared the Democrats to using the charges for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power by any means possible.
You see the heartbreak, the cruelty, they don't care who they are suffering, who they will have to turn to for power and control,  Mediaite reported that the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in their game against Dundee
Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 comeback match against Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals in the season with goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie returned to put the guys home in the mix before Dwyer restored the Giants' morale.
Francois Bouchard returned for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the year between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford came in as Beauvillier extended the lead four minutes later.
In what was a developmental period filled with scandal, Sullivan brought the home crowd back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was an assistant for Cownie's response at 15:16.
Dwyer saw the Giants take the lead into the first half when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard again put them in a tie with a big goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead in the competition at the end of the second period, and he closed the victory with his team's fifth goal in the semi-final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A pilot dies to see hundreds of passengers killed in earthquake
An Indonesian aviation official is hailed as a hero after he made sure that a cargo plane carrying hundreds of people landed safely.
More than 800 people died, most of them without a trace, after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe earthquakes continued to affect the area, mostly trapped under the grass in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawang Agung has quit his job on the control room and waved at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was determined to ensure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway, was able to fly more safely.
Then he jumped off the cockpit when he thought he was about to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved many lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take her to a hospital in another city.
And sadly he left us this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were heartbroken to hear about this", he added.
On the other hand, authorities and fears that the death toll could reach thousands have caused the city's disaster management agency to say the roads to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are locked.
"The number is believed to be still rising as many people are still under threat of extinction while still not having access to the majority", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A storm of six meters has damaged Palu which is causing a huge landslide on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The coldest of small shops are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a disaster, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the local army: I ask you all to work day and night to complete any work related to the bombing.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year an earthquake hit Indonesia in Lombok killing 550 people.
Micronesia air disaster: Air Niugini leaves one man unharmed after a submarine crash
The flight and the flight controller who crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now said one man was missing, after initially saying that all 47 passengers and crew on board had been evacuated safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, that it had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or country.
A local ferry helped rescue passengers and other crew when the plane ran aground while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the event are unclear.
The pilots and the U.S. Navy said that the plane crashed into the beach shortly before it hit the road.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the road.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed a little.
"That's a great thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others tried to cross the water on foot and reached the emergency exit of the plane with a limp.
He said that the flight crew were terrified and screaming, and that he had a small wound to his head.
The U.S. Navy said that crew and pilots nearby were working to improve the harbor and helped with rescue operations by using a balloon boat and bringing people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed 111 people died in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades but could not include Air Niugini.
Researchers show the time of night a woman was burned alive
The jury dropped its trial on Saturday on the appeal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett has testified for a long time as an expert witness in the field of intelligence testing.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis and Chambers were with her on the evening of her death, contrary to her last words, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that Chambers was using his cell phone at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford sat down on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the jury questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was thinking about Tuesday, because I was in Nashville.
Another misconception was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before his death.
Phone records show that the two had known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and text messages from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life", Hale said.
The kidnappers and the defenders will begin their final debate on Sunday.
The Chief Justice said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop genius?
Three hip hop artists wanted to change the bad image for the genre by filling their music with beautiful messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has left its natural political message and addressed social issues.
They wanted to go back to its roots and make hip hop artistically popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent touring in the UK from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY child abuser sues couple for dismissal after getting a sex-crime report
A NY child molester sues a couple for firing her because of her race after receiving a letter from her mother complaining that she is another black person.
The couple denied that they were having an affair, saying the case was a money laundering scheme.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anger when she discovered that baby-sitter Giselle Maurice was black as she approached her first day of work in 2016.
MARKETING THE SEVENTH, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a note.
In fact, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After finding her guilty, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their kidnapper, who was African-American, had done a bad job on her in Filipino expectations, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice and the couple are suing for a ransom for the kidnapping, and he is seeking a $350 per day ransom for the month of June, and the housing arrangement that previously employed him, despite no written agreement.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do the same thing", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's biased".
The couple have denied the allegations of being biased, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the right thing to do, and fearing they could not trust him after they had offended him.
My wife sent him a message that she did not mean.
He was a man of lot.
We are not voters", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But will you give your children to someone you have spoken ill of, even in sin?
Your baby?
Please come.
Describing the case as a money laundering, Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago, and she was in a difficult situation.
Would you chase such a person away?
That's not necessarily a good thing to do, the reserve bank official added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple to public scandal, criticizing them for their behavior and opinions.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand beer and speech, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born immediately after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the position of the person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's three big laughs now and you know the big good story of Paddington.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he got inspired to write the children's book for a little beer toy, would have a good hope that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was ilu na ụtọ after his death last year.
Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family", also said that his father was proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a gentle man, not a proud one", he said.
But because Paddington lives so much for him, it's like having a little child who has accomplished something: you'll feel so proud of them even if it's not necessarily your own doing.
I think he saw the progress of Paddington along the way.
Although it was his own invention and will, all the while he was giving Paddington credit for himself.
My daughter is dead, and I can only keep her alive by telephone
In failure her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling every hour to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to live", Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad to say that he would die in the next two minutes, I had to tell him that he was.
I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you, it's in my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
He was given medication to keep his soul alive as the arrow slowly and steadily passed out of his body.
He had already died, and this was the end of all of them.
I waited a little longer, knowing that everything was going to be all right.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in the position of family and people around me.
I need to get myself together.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - who were unaware of what she was going through.
"No one knows", he said.
I nodded, and the girl was crying all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt a deep emotional pain for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Women mourning and handing out cards to prevent the payment of water rope
Two women who have been kidnapped by their loved ones and work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been distributing cards with messages and phone numbers since the Welsh seas where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I do every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son is a chef and a promising future with a smile and a smile.
He was known for his sense of humor.
They talk all the time and laugh and lift every room.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was too ill.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the one who found out after his brother committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: I always thought there would be a reaction.
Ms. Davis made the cards, to let people know that there are people here they can reach out to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit back - you should talk.
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davies, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He said he didn't say he was humble or depressed or anything,.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the floor on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents and looked at him and saw nothing.
She said that her death was a great shock to them, but they would work together to overcome it: It created a hole in the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigations begin
"I think if we can get something like what he's asking for - a limited, limited review - we can bring a little bit of unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the congregation and the organization are in a tight political lockdown.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of interest is due to time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they won't have much power in their bid to get the man they want nominated for the state's highest court.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Congress, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases his report?
Elections will be held in the House of Representatives, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently in the chamber.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the lower house of Congress, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to call his case and put it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seun, referring to data from the South's Ministry of Integration, said there had been 1,127 escapees last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the tightening of the border between North Korea and China and the high costs of evacuation were among the causes.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Many of the North's refugees are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee from China, which has the longest land border between North Korea and is still easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China is finding the refugees as more illegal immigrants than refugees and angrily returning them.
Relations between North and South - still at war - have seen a marked improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for further talks focused on nuclear proliferation.
This came after a major June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a broad topic of working together for a Korean land and nuclear-weapon-free future.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we can be a one-time consensus on the spread of our weapons", Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", saying he was not old enough to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh "crazy" and said she was too angry to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman did something like that, they would say 'crazy,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his teenage years, Kavanaugh's spirits were so high, he sometimes wanted to scream but this voice would kill him as he talked about his family and his college years.
He also made clear to the Democrats in the assembly, that the allegations against him were "a terrible, bloody attack" by the liberals and anger at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed her dislike of Democrats.
He said "I think he's defended himself by using those words and by the way he's criticized the Clintons and the Democrats".
Pelosi was quiet when asked if she would like to remove Kavanaugh if he is put in office, if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is he no longer fit to be on the Supreme Court, but you're on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that while the Democrat is concerned about the legality of Kavanaugh's bill would be for the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as a hindrance to change.
In the process of being sworn in, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a madman, who is trying to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not right,'" Pelosi said.
The Women Should Use It.
It was a fair criticism, months and years of anger and despair, he could not say without crying.
"We were crying when we got angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's new, do you?
She continued, I got a lot of help from a woman who is a local chairperson, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she learned a technique which means when she gets angry and starts crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I was angry.
Then he would move on.
I thought that was pretty cool.
Tears are accepted as an excuse for anger on one side because of its clear understanding.
One of my fondest memories was at the beginning of my career, past the men's club, where I found myself still in the distance and in a rage, being dragged behind my back by an old lady - a cold manager whom I was somewhat afraid of - who dragged me to the bathroom.
"Don't let them see you crying", he told me.
They don't realize how upset you are.
They think you're sad, they'll be happy because they've got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked for Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business, and he left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, in a fit of rage, found no reason not to consider running for president herself.
It was not a thought, he told me with a smile 30 years later.
There are seven other candidates in the race, and they want another one.
One called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because he was late for the ad, he was behind in raising money, so he vowed not to enter the race unless he won $2 million.
It is a battle to be fought.
He found that some of his supporters had given the men $1000 and had returned only $250.
Do you think I could get a discount? he considered.
When he announced his decision not to launch a full campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion - thanks to the people who supported him, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than representatives, and anger at gender bias - he was left speechless.
"You might think I was scared", Ms. Schroeder recalled about how the press caught up with her.
You might think Kleenex is a sponsor.
I remember thinking, What will be put on my tombstone?
Did he cry?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial tensions of the US-China trade war have been overshadowed, and while the fighting is far from over, the division between the countries could bring Beijing future benefits, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, had earlier this year warned by imposing tariffs on Chinese shipping markets including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest stimulus this week came with new tariffs affecting a $200 billion (£150 billion) increase in prices, with tariffs being imposed on half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing has also made similar efforts, recently imposing a five to 10 percent tax on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to unite the US, the world's second largest economy, in no time.
To discourage Washington means to agree to demands, but to publicly denounce the US would be a great embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still insist that if Beijing plays its cards well, the US trade war could support China in a positive way in the future by reducing the imbalance between the two economies.
"The fact that a speedy political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that initiates economic turmoil in the same two countries is still more dangerous than what observers have previously agreed", said Abigail Grace, an analyst with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security, advisors.
Syria is a preparation for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the return of the refugees themselves, and is calling for help in rebuilding the city that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the city is improving.
He said "Today the situation on the ground is still good and safe, thanks to the progress made in preventing the intruders".
The government continued to repair the areas damaged by the floods to restore the situation.
All the current conditions for the return of refugees to their homelands left by the displaced and the economic conditions of the targeted groups and their livelihoods and their occupations.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the countryside in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept help and rebuild the damaged city.
But he also stressed that he would not accept any kind of state aid or aid from the countries that support the conflict.
Europe holds the Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16:5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row in Europe, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as one of captain Thomas Bjorn's Danish squad reached their goal of 14.5 to beat the United States.
US legend Phil Mickelson, who had a lot of trouble in the tournament, threw his ball in the water on a 3 for 16 shot, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has done well throughout his career, being the only player to go 1-for-4 to go 5-0-0 since the current league system began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America fell 5-4 to the youngest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 to 1 to Ian Poulter of England who managed to play in his final Ryder Cup.
Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia is the most decorated European at the tournament, with 25.5 points over his career.
I don't cry often, but today I can't stop crying.
It was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for accepting me.
I was overjoyed, and I was happy to get the cup again.
It was for the team, I felt I could help, which Garcia was full of spirit said in the European victory.
He handed the trophy to fellow countryman John Ram who knocked out US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"This great pride I have, to beat Tiger Woods, I watch the man grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 of Ryder Cup records.
The reckoning and the imagination of one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major trophies second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the way past the only exceptions being Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extremely high golf throughout the tournament.
Captain US Jim Furyk spoke after a game that was not good for his team, I feel proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were cooking the Europeans.
We fell.
Thanks to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Conference, and we'll move on.
I loved these 12 men, and I was proud to serve as a captain.
You'll hit the ground.
We did well.
