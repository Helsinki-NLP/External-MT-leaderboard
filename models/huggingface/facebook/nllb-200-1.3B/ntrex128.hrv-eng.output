Welsh MPs are worried they'll look like Muppets
Some Assembly Members (AM) were stunned by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the chamber the Welsh Parliament.
MPs from all political spectrums are concerned they could become the object of a ruse.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name romies with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means a fool.
A Welsh MP from Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was 'more satisfied' and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was open to a name change, but that the MWP could quickly turn into the Muppet in speech.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the bill to introduce the name change announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how parliamentarians will be titled will be up to them.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had found broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the Members of Parliament in the House, the Committee preferred to call them 'Members of the Welsh Parliament' or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
House members are proposing alternative options, but the battle for consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill to change the law within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the parliament, including rules on disqualification of parliamentarians and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the bill, the House of Representatives will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The purpose of the vote is to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
The Commission has also requested the Commission to provide further information on the measures taken by Greece to comply with the provisions of the Schengen acquis.
Macedonian President Gyorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's have gone out as the churches of Harlem struggle to survive
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither one nor the other.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and will sooner or later be found again.
He added that the churches could replace the apartment buildings with apartments for people who would not be helping the other churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the day will come sooner when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of those churches".
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held worship services nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were opposed to the hiring or promotion of blacks.
The fire of 1939 badly damaged the building, but as Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the large carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been taking place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the diocese made up of laity, wrote to the diocese in July out of concern that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego station KSWB-TV that he and friends were diving for about an hour and a half Saturday morning when they heard the boy's call for help, and then he and a group of others rowed to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was the excitement of catching lobster, but then he realized he was screaming "Bite me!"
He bit me!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
"I'm trying to get everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a non-threatening species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the bathing community.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetics counters and engaging specialist retailers.
As part of a major entry into the UK beauty market of GBP 2,8 billion, which continues to grow as sales in the clothing and home furnishings market decline, larger cosmetic countertops will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one way that supermarkets are trying to take advantage of shelf space once reserved for TVs, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
Representatives of Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetics offer to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique line of decorative cosmetics, so most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be trial-testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon in south London and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily shopping of small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter the favourable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitat's divisions, because it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims stimulated grocery sales and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments had been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from the pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed the sale of Sainsbury's' pharmaceutical business in 281 Celestia, three years ago, for £125 million, to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by placing a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics department to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in special training for a colleague who will be on the customer's side and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits.
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby dropped her £11 million contract
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones left to flare up in anger after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11million deal with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the department store chain Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of homewear and fashion accessories.
Their brand has been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of This Morning (37) on Instagram has announced she's leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones to cook in anger by pulling out of a last-minute, profitable joint venture to focus on her own brilliant new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the golden girl of television during a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their Truly brand of household clothing and fashion accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source stated that "Truly" was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the launch of the entire line.
At the headquarters of the Marlow Company there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable startups, could cost the company millions of dollars in losses due to the large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the possible additional delay in launching the line.
And it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
Couples are vacationing together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we don't want to comment on his business activities.
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the press for comments that some might consider "undignified by the president" and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so many concessions?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I made no concessions.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead the US still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech to the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were threatened with war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results - halting missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting outside this crowded arena at the entrance, we'd have about 200 people there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomong has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international help, so it's all a bit problematic", Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Bureau, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to get involved in the relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, that country remains woefully unprepared to deal with nature's wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure was the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Joko is struggling with a lack of funds, and new elections are held the following year.
Joko is also facing pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea on Saturday with an 89th-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a substitution from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea.
He passed the ball to his left foot before he kicked it toward the opposite end.
The ball flew high above the net towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was demanding to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once.
Chelsea took the lead at half-time with a 1-0 lead after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning around somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he threw a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball into the net with his left foot on the opposite court next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool play a match of the Champions League club competition against Napoli at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are to welcome Videoton to the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster office said early Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5 magnitude quake felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on people in the area to report if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said the investigation is still in its infancy, but I'd like to get in touch with anyone who's been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
Friends who believe they know the woman arrived on the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police said they are also in the process of notifying the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but officers told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants were now told it would be several hours before they could return to their apartments.
The officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene of the crime in tears.
She keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, referring to record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found amidst the debate over the end of history.
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate now going on over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not something that Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamow Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century way of thinking and a piece of historiography of a man who is still considered by many to be worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the single most recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are still worthy of honor and celebration.
Pig killer killed Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man named only as Yuan was found dead with his arteries cut and covered in blood near a barn in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit the farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News reported that a cousin who goes by the nickname Wu said: My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had trapped a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disinfectant".
They're just a setup.
They're gnawing, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As previously announced, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters over the next few days to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa was blowing at 0500 hours eastern time, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low pressure area to cause heavy precipitation over much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mudslides and possible desert landslides.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will produce precipitation of about 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be as high as 25 to 100 millimeters in some parts of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Severe flooding is possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not advisable to go into the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms would bring local gusty winds and dust vortices.
The approach of the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause less mud and slippery roads.
It will be the first rains of the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before covering a wider area by the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area where the state borders Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and continue all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will continue to rise and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, early October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C] from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political debate continued, and reporters interrupted their regular program to announce a last-minute twist that Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, while drunk, had touched her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh has stated in his ardent testimony that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The Friday hearing was likely watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to a Nielsen report.
The company has been counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen also has a problem with measuring the number of people who watch content in their offices.
To put it more simply, this is an audience that is similar in size to the one that watches a football game or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest average viewership of 5.69 million during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in a drama that was set on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning captured him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down as he was spat upon by protesters in front of CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
They said to him, "You have power, and so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed he'd have more to say at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all the cable and TV networks were watching live as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate within the next week, which Democrats, who are in the minority, have demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview in the same issue with her on the front page went on to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU should charge each other customs duties was 'total nonsense'.
Wayde Sims murder: police have arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of negligent homicide, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video footage of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, CBS affiliate, reported.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
Bail has been requested for 350,000 US dollars.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their perseverance and pursuit of truth.
Sims was 20.
The 6'3" wingman grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatapetl volcano has reached southern Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center was following multiple thunder and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been observing increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles southeast of the capital, since the 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were excused by the intervention police, began shooting at the police with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would otherwise have been flooded with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and in their face, the unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, have not abated a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal and which Catalans celebrate.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence although turnout was low as those who opposed secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
Last year was one of the best times we had.
I watched my parents crying from happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite achieving a crucial, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties are struggling to keep pace this year as their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstrations in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government', he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car chasing into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after they crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 7.30pm BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door was damaged and the building itself.
It's possible that at some point, a single-shot arrow was fired at the car.
Meng's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston brought the win
Scottish Premiership side Livingston surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit to only his second defeat in 18 games at the helm of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Meng's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team tied the Iberian in seconds.
Gerrard's team is still unbeaten in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play Hearts, the league's top club, eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers of the Europa League will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't had a losing season since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against the dying guests
Holt's team should have been leading before they scored that goal, given that their directness in attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only aim the ball wide after slipping to intercept a head shot by Craig Halkett towards the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause inconvenience to the guests
And that is exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free-kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly assisting Mengi who scored in the middle of the goal.
By this point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they were facing an impregnable home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of action.
That continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's legs were untied by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a wide kick from another organised attack by Livingston.
Long runs failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleven-point shutouts were not counted after Halkett's clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one for a hand.
♪ Brilliantly by Livingston ♪
Alasdar Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great game and a score by Livingston.
All of them were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on that entry trail.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but a lot of credit goes to Holt and the way he's brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the helm of a well-organized defense, and Mengo was not letting Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall get a breath of fresh air throughout the game.
But the Rangers were short of inspiration.
They were a long way from the standard they set with good play under Gerrard.
They've only made one hole in the home team, and that's a call to arms for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the pack.
Erdogan met with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), there was a lot of laughter under the clear sky as the leaders of Turku and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police blocked a mass gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - including a large number of Kurds - raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back to the country.
The violent demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks hail as a hero and others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford on the city's southeast around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after a hit-and-run crash on Chiders Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
City police said officers are working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The accident has closed roads and diverted bus traffic, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six police officers injured in riots
Prison officials say six police officers have been injured in a riot at the men's detention center.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado troops have been brought in to quell the unrest involving eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers were on the scene, assisted by minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Special trained prison staff have been engaged to resolve the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars.
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the emergency police were called to the prison to deal with a serious situation where the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (potential benefit to dry areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but there's a chance that it will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining strength passes over the Desert's southwest and brings the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for an area from western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and pass directly over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depressions within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts 50 to 100 millimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimeters on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west of the desert including the Stenyak and the Great Basin, there is a probability of rainfall of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from the flash floods, Rosa could come as a relief as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major threat, some of this precipitation could be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. drought map, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
The hurricane's path first approached the coastline along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still hurricane-force, with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour, and was located some 400 miles [620 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at 20 miles per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
So it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwest Sonora is between 75 and 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat from Rose or her remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in the Baja California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in deserts and mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
Around 0400 BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and is stable.
Avon and Somerset Police Department said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called for anyone with footage of the incident to report.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has said that Kavanaugh "suffered the wrath and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the indictment hearing she filed.
The president said Saturday that on that day, the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump has asserted that the mission of the Democrats is to "create resistance and obstruction".
The Republican vice chairman told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, many of them as a result of the huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hit the shore at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately and died", said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was dragging cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The ensuing shocks continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was twice the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggests that the city's geographical location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugro, the number of casualties and damage may have been greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely cut off and we have no information from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to disclose the tsunami that hit Palu, although officials claim the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard panickingly warning people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that caused communications to be cut off around Palua, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the military, cargo planes have started to arrive with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other essentials.
City Airport has reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision personnel from Donggale successfully arrived in Palu city where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their offices, they passed on scenes of destruction along the way", Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although aid groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise are prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international aid, but that's not yet declared.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hit Palu on Friday, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved one would be one of those miracles that mitigate the dark scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"Given the many years I've spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray button instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves have stolen $26,750 during a cash-filling operation in downtown Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was loading an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement says the driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of cash.
While he was busy doing this, another man came up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene of the robbery, but police did not give the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In a Saturday tweet announcing the change, he wrote: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's creators said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had cancelled for "emotional reasons".
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti", West said earlier this year in an interview about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So, I'm you, I'm us, that's what we are.
It started with Kanye, which means "one", in just Ye. It's a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a string of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the military against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square vowed that he would never use the military against the Mexican people.
Military troops opened fire during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in this area", said AI investor and expert Kai Fu Leeu, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling investment could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence coming to the U.S"., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book, AI Great Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat out the top American player in the game of Othello, and later he was the director of research at Microsoft and the president of Google's China division.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
Lee says that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Science Foundation provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide financial resources to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China", Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over 100 million US dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been sitting idle for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Saturday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked the opening of negotiations to join the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents an appropriation of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gyorge Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect it to be considered decisive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has stated that as of 1:00 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, in Strumica, voted in a referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and moved chairs in front of the tent set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said a positive result would be a guarantee of our future.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, showed that 57 percent of those polled intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the whole Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday and won 2-0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders and then made it to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender, then overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's grounds.
Then he added the ball to Sterling's left.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero who hit a right-handed kickoff into the right side of the net and beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero has some foot problems, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has told reporters.
We planned to play about 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got the shot at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting lead in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's court during that game.
He's got a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the podium.
The Sky Blues striker put the ball in the net before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop the Rockies from moving forward.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to insist on a fresh start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping for a win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make the playoffs.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to at least secure a wild-card spot in the playoffs, but they're still hoping to win their first title.
While we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and another team would be playing at the highest level I'd witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but in that case, they're reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hander has posted an 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 earned run average (ERA), and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president, during a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, made a tacit comment on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice.
Everything we've done will be put to the test in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump continues: "Look at this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They intend to take power again by any means; you see the evil, the corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control; so they want power and control.
The Democrats, he says, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
"You've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt, and liars".
He addressed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud public outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the documentary. It was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer respects dissent.
He does not tolerate the expression of personal views.
It didn't surprise me too much when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome, all because we said what we had in mind.
According to my legal associate, Joan Ryan, they acted similarly because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship motion for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership on.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I've been a local Labour MP, the main council meetings on Friday nights have been just like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are held in a different tone, and the promise of a "kind, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought shared similar political views began demanding a drastic change of heart from me and a position I would never have agreed with otherwise - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a flurry of offensive words on social media calling for my dismissal, renouncing the policies of the Centre and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily avalanche of sexist or racist comments, but never give up.
One aspect of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every motion of no confidence or change in the electoral rules we become a narrower party.
Many times in the last two years I've been advised to keep my head down, to keep my voice down and to be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government which left my school's multi-purpose classroom in decline, I've wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grappling with Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting in the way I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr  Melrose: 38: 17 undefeated Ayr heading for the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final score, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're at the top of the league and the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, a great defense and a better use of the opportunity led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"They've tested us in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from the Melrose Club said, "All due respect to Ayra, they've taken their chances better than we have".
A 14th-minute attempt by Frazier Climo from Grant Anderson brought Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to boost the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by 11 points before scoring a goal in the half to make a solo attempt to turn the score 17:5 ahead of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and a try by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then a long break occurred due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was taken on stretchers, and as the game resumed, Ayr continued a good game with a try by Stafford McDowall who realized the Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and this by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The sideman, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to knock out the unbottled Clima; from the penalty line, MacPherson carried the laying behind Ayra in a full-stroke penalty.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took a high kick from David Armstrong and sent sideman Gregor Henry to the home team in the fifth attempt.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, star of the hit series Still Game, appears poised to resume his service career after it was revealed that he's been appointed CEO of a company that owns licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favourite series, for which he is a writer and co-star, alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and it seems Kiernan is planning to dedicate his life to the aftermath of Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wants to get involved in the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes to be granted access to the Pacific by the court
The sailors are patrolling the naval center full of elevators in La Paz.
An ocean-colored flag has been reported on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are told by the winged creature: "We have the right to the sea".
It's our duty to return it.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline to Chile during the 19th-century resource conflict is still alive - as is the yearning for renewed Pacific voyages.
As Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1, after a five-year process, those hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of difficult negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We're on our way back to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings means that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea is currently being taken up by the Bolivian leadership", Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried any goodwill in Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "unprecedented opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an "opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement to mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most beloved presidents - used the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is a chance to see that we need to get past it.
North Korea has said it will not achieve nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will never disarm nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made today during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be keen to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after his Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that sanctions have continued because of "permissible fantasies" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will not bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to have a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of large headgear on the way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely shade yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a line of unbuttoned giant headgear for their 2019 spring and summer collection at the runway and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
The extremely impractical hats this summer have been Instagrammed, and these designers have posted their creations that attract attention on the track.
The most prominent example was a large beige hat with a wide, feather-like rim that completely "takes over" the model's head.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick stitches and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creature resembled a diving suit with a blowtorch and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion saying, "luck is on your side".
Stylists predict that giant hats could be coming to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the soles of the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a rim about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that took social media to the runway has sent another big creation  a straw bag for the beach almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The orange-hued raffle bag, decorated with raffle ribbons and white leather linen, was a showcase item in Jacquemus' 2019 La Riviera summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm expecting big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer, and with the designer leaving such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories".
John Edward: Language skills needed by the world's citizens
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, and further emphasised by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education and higher education, the careers they want, and to make them citizens of the world.
As the education sector can design and implement the said school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest marks in languages were achieved by pupils from independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent score in Mandarin, while 72% of pupils learning German, 69% of pupils learning French and 63% of pupils learning Spanish also achieved the highest possible score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of a labour force with language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, those who learn a foreign language will in the future experience the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more than one language can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives him an advantage over his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4000 adults, 75% of UK respondents do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, or 15%.
So investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing countries, they will have a better chance of finding good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will choose the languages considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a wide range of options, as will teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment in which children learn to prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be overlooked that in today's global business world, language skills are so important for the future of any country that they must be reflected in education.
So, knowing modern languages really should be viewed as an "international communication skill".
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will make his first appearance in the Lakers' uniform on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans are about to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need preseason games", he declared.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign with a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned rallies Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for the new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be watched online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the recent hearings of Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over sexual assault allegations.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gain a lead in the November elections.
So Trump's presidential campaign headquarters says the five meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and getting them to sign on as Republicans try to maintain and increase their majority in the Senate and House", Reuters reports.
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign", an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, where he won the 2016 election by more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for the Senate, Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls", political scientist Simon Haedar of West Virginia University told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA left heart on the field before the individual events on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a pair-on-pair match on Sunday afternoon may be just what it takes to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"Luck turns around" is a saying that holds true in sports and that athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the wheel of fortune now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so I think luck is on our side at the moment", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are up by four points with 12 points left in the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his pair play with Justin Thomas, with whom he scored three of his four points after a full day of play.
Spieth has played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The fan-favorite cheers grew louder as Spieth and Thomas came within two points of each other, culminating in a crucial pathway that brought Spieth to the score.
After the 15-hole victory, there was a similar cheering scream, which reflected the hope and belief that the Americans could turn things around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game", Spieth declared.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but irresistible European couple has the maximum number of points and can't go wrong.
Mollywood is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, and the incredible energy that binds Fleetwood and Molinari, shows that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than these two to seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Le Golf National in Paris.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's doubles game.
One bogey and two double bogey on the first nine holes of the course buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't dig out.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch couples play up close because you can see the interactions of the players in pairs, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, and study the strategy that can be changed in an instant.
The Europeans have played better as a team, and they are coming into the final day with a significant lead, but this game in pairs also showed that the US team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
The Europeans enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
The Europeans are coming off Saturday's doubles, and on the final day of the Ryder Cup, they're coming in with a significant 10-6 lead over the United States.
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in their quest to win the trophy that was stripped from them at Hazeltine two years ago, were superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs, with a score of 3 to 1.
The American team showed greater combativeness in pairs winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophy, Jim Fury's teams need to collect eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutant from a European team to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to score four points in a pair-game in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they proved superior in a game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who hasn't had a top-notch performance in two games on Saturday, has made some brilliant moves, but now he's got 19 losses from 29 games in fourball and doubles and seven straight losses.
Justin Rose paused the morning's fourballs to return to the doubles game with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's No. 1 and No. 3 players.
But Europeans did not fare nearly so well on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple-winning Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their American team.
They first beat Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team that was four points behind the rest of the field has managed to come back in individual games, even though Furyk's team needs only a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of delay, it looks like their Sunday counterattack will be hard to come by.
North Korea has declared that there is no chance of unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea last year took "significant measures of goodwill", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station and making a decision to stop developing nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States", he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't trust our national security, and under such circumstances, there's no way we're going to be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the U.S. has demanded that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that continuing sanctions increase mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting that the US president had talked about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the last five months, adding: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this halt".
Regardless, the tone of Minister Ri's speech was vastly different from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and declared that the targeting of the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, this year at the United Nations praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that they still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riyadh at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him out a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea has arranged a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will be achieved if the United States takes appropriate action.
He added that Kim had disclosed to him that these "appropriate measures" were related to the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course on how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the increasingly pervasive culture of caffeinated learning and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's top university often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I only learn this now, in my last year of college?"
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement and improve overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, says that the university decided to introduce the course after students were observed to have a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involved a picture of a student's dorm room where students had to click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map is displayed with interactive icons that encourage students to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that student behavior won't change immediately.
But we feel that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of studying all night before exams is still alive, says the professor, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety should be good, quality sleep, which also helps fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, putting it into a state of starvation and causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar course of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on their alarm during sleep as well as when they wake up, being aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt their circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston  Rangers 1-0 Meng's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after a hit by Dolly Meng crushed Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with a 1-0 victory over Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to secure their first away win since their February triumph and 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his side are now eight points behind the leading Ladbrokes in the Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to run out of inspiration and didn't seem to be going to tie the score.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third with just one home run behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence sustained a head injury when he was thrown a long-range object.
Gerrard made eight changes to his flanks and so he went alongside Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was going with the same setup as Livingston who took Hearts to the plate last week and would have been delighted that his well-designed setup had stifled every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after Mengo was first sent off, which gave Scott Pittman a chance to go for Alan McGregor's goal, however, the goalkeeper missed the opportunity.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate kick to the back rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, it seemed like they were playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the referee should have given him an 11th in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed to get just two balls into the end zone in the first half, but for former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, a head-butt from Lassana Coulibaly and a stupid shot from Ovie Eary were no big deal.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play slowed the game down, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again failed to use Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his composure and chose Mengu for an easy finish to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which was almost an instant hit as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but Kelly's impressive blocking from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the exact game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long blow after another.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor effectively disrupted Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entry from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late for the 11th because he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes away again.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now comes a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago ...the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention he developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science since that time, the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that, God?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals.
Look at that, it's just coming out!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot bad cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the bad cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient and converting them into a laboratory.
The cells are treated to recognize the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman, a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells helped to reduce ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune system cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to recognize a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from a patient and teaching them how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, joined the Trump debate and supported him, wearing a cap that read "Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-in performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song at the Ghost Town night, during which he wore a cap that read "Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against the Democrat and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people so often and they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist".
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to woo West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he was being pushed backstage because of the hat he was wearing.
They pissed me off backstage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat".
They were bullying me!
They said I was drowned, reports the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he's going to put on his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.
Variety magazine reported that his comments at least twice caused public outrage, and the members of Saturday Night Live appeared embarrassed, with one person telling the magazine: "The whole studio went silent".
West was called in at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle of mineral water, stunned many.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous people in the world: THANK YOU FOR OPPOSING THE MAFIA".
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself" and that it was absolutely wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And we are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder with a knife in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police have reported an incident at Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast Offences Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, has succumbed to toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-bearer in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor resists the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such television roles often make boys feel that they must be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he wants to "face this problem very decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment "where did we go wrong with manhood?" he asked.
What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now face?
Keith believes that television, thanks to its highly masculine characters on screen, may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these certain traits of a man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because something's obviously gone wrong with the boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming the sequel to Game of Thrones after its conclusion next summer, and said that he was "finished with battles and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother's robbery.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set of that show, which gave me a family and a future", he revealed.
Rose was in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, playing Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Around 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan, Chinese health authorities said that the number of people who become infected with HIV in this way is almost nonexistent.
Yet, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but there is talk of discrimination against LGBT people.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, in 2003 the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked information about GOP senators to the public, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had released the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assures us that these claims are being spread by right-wing individuals, as well as the website.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters tweeted.
The leaked data reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information leaked online on Thursday was released by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the data release belongs to the office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
Any member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations is in no way responsible for the leak of this data.
These baseless allegations are completely false and absolutely false.
Ms. Waters's statement quickly attracted online critics, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is a furious denial", wrote Fleischer.
It shows Waters doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He mustn't question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and composed.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism Democrats are making of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had notified the "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet", she continued.
Johnny English: Back on the job, not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights a spy
It is now common in every new British film to ask for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be the case in the new screen adaptation of the action series Johnny English, whose first sequel, titled Johnny English, premiered in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title Johnny English Rides Again.
Will the curvy satire of how obviously useless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes peeled and face rubbery has permission to complicate the situation again, while his name more than anything says that this is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where the cinema is not in English.
He is of course a disgruntled secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean, and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
His character is also inspired by the traveller and mysterious worldman that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, and who is the epitome of chaos.
There's one or two good moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that "serious" film titles like 007 and "Mission Impossible" themselves offer elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children, not adults, and I think that Johnny English's wild coincidences are not as innovative and focused as the Atkinson's silent gags embodied in Mr. Bean.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
A hacker has broken into Britain's most secretive spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the horror of the acting agent, who unfortunately appears briefly as Kevin Eldon.
It's a spillover of the Prime Minister's patience, arrogance and warlike character who is experiencing the complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to portray faithfully the character that should represent Theresa May, but she hasn't quite got the material to do something about it.
Her intelligence advisors reveal that all active spies have been compromised and she will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person is going to be the reckless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaching how to become a secret agent: here are some cute gags because English teaches rock-and-roll-style spying.
English is rushed to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the over-enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential has been largely squandered.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything wrong are back in action and meet the beautiful and fatal woman Ophelia Bullet as Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and funny coincidences: disguised as waiters they light up a fancy French restaurant, cause enormous disorder by smuggling into Volt's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the interior of Volt's house looks like.
Everything was done right for this last sequel, but as attractive and elaborate as the film was, it still had plenty of childish elements.
Pretty mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I again wondered if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched his talent?
The Labour Party is denying that it is working on a plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week and be paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants the bosses to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to the workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could fit into the party's economic program and plans to make the country more favorable to workers' interests.
The trade union congress has backed the move to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
The four-day workweek will not be achieved overnight, but represents a drive that fits into the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this tendency.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being discussed by the party".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to work out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's decided to take power from the hands of faceless CEOs and profit-makers in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not be able to recover their full stake because the Labour government could make deductions based on observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10 per cent of the capital of private companies would go to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency's finding could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance the FBI would uncover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after you were briefed, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, was as if it were carved in stone.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong indictment to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied everything", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named could corroborate her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission:
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park to not only enjoy performances by stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen really given that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of "clicking" where people feel like by signing an online petition or tweeting they're actually making a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million shares by its supporters who have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in more than $37 billion of economic impact by 2030 affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The group estimates that the funds insured have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and implementers committed to helping children develop to their full potential, with a pledge to provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a mere fluke in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition that will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which reads: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we'll fail".
But we will succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us did, because together we are stronger.
Performances by Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports.
Washington can, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russian involvement in Syria - particularly where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, southern Europe", he says.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the opening of sea lanes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself in the United States as the "voice of the energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuels", he said, and for Russia he says "the same trick is used in fossil fuel-dependent economies".
The comments came at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a face-to-face meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in charge", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
Warren has expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that he is leading his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent voting for the potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin is mentioning PTSD to Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after returning, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general issue that is being kept quiet for her son and other war veterans, saying they're coming back a little different, coming back hardened, coming back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given to this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a female, obstructing a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly briefing Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reports.
The full names of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy have not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and violent members of his gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries that face pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an impediment violates this principle, states the Friends of the Court report.
The lawyers further argued that a policy that denies immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "secure the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualties double in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting more difficult.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her son who was shaking with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
The ambulance is bringing bodies in every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through flooded things, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake were in ruins.
Some of the injured, including Dwija Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of the tremor shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the rubble wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "harassment" through "propaganda ads".
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily promoting mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid-for addition to Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubling economic path because the media is under the heavy pressure of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that some of China's most prominent newspapers had turned down an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
Kavanaugh's debacle has kept Republicans from voting in the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many Republicans supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite stirring, and a majority of Republicans have already shown they still want to cast their ballots.
Such things cannot be returned, said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come cold!" protesting in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
People say they're already high-level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among suburban women and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts are hinting that there could be a backlash if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It's a real mess for the Big Old Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the bench, but the way the Republicans approached it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more inclination toward him.
A new poll released by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that's developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, thinking of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal network data storage or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online storage is that the decision about who can access what information is entirely up to the users.
The company calls it "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few engineers who signed contracts to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will implement a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the award of the Victoria Cross to World War I priests
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter has been staged in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was shot by a sniper and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat for which he received this recognition.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal, "through very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and engine room".
Later he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the troops forward before he, without any help, rushed to the Polish cannon and slaughtered three of the military detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's achievements were "something I know I could never achieve, and that inspires humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Pepp.
Imagine this: you stay up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches only to end up unable to follow the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and in the UK it was shown live at night on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by Pepper's Rooster.
Many were not impressed after being kept up until the early hours of the morning just to fight.
One fan described the interruption of the children's cartoon broadcast on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
"Under state regulations, that content is not appropriate for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to move it to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the move.
"Yup, the 'Pork Peppa'".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, has said he will align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider re-enacting, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
But the transmission is there at six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday, when it's Monday at their place.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut off, there was a lot of correspondence going around that wasn't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do, and we tried to give our fans more, but we went overboard.
It was an unfortunate circumstance.
Tom Daley felt inferior when it came to sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he started high school, he was not aware that "everyone is like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" compared to others because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said, "Until today, these feelings of inferiority and of being different from others were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove he was something so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said it surprised him to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young you go through so much", he said, looking back on his first Olympic Games when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find someone his age who hasn't experienced the same ups and downs".
In June, they became parents to a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, the whole story would be about me having to win the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be first in line.
I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you're not gonna be here long enough to be first in line", he said.
"I held his hand as he expired, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died, that I finally became aware that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel better", he said.
It was also the inspiration for choosing the first song ̶ Proud by singer Heather Small ̶ which resonated in him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which he always resents.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson off the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to fully recover to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who is playing in this biennial tournament for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-a-side games.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working his game out in the gym in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where a long, unstable course routinely punishes inaccurate shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is up against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 12 games out, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had faith in his man - more than he could say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a celebrity and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's what happened and we felt we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everybody else.
Mickelson is set to surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people, and he's a great guy for the team", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory by a narrow margin of 141⁄2 - 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that this isn't over.
You'll be playing at full strength tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floor is announced on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I'm talking all the time, focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who's up against us - the greatest players in the world.
Bjorn was delighted with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, adding: "I would never run in front of a rope in this.
Tomorrow, we're going to face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the main singles, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there as an individual, they ultimately test your golfing skills.
That's the message you have to get to the players, and that's that tomorrow they have to do their best.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate on the other side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big turns on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as the loser after Europa performed the "miracle" in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, cheered his players up before the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When that rush goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
So we've organized our lineup and we've arranged the guys like, you know, we're going to try to do the magic tomorrow".
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main bout, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the top half.
"I decided to put this group of guys in this order because I think it's all inclusive", Bjorn said of the players selected for individual matches.
German new warship put back on hold
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reports citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period ̶ it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years without returning to home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which are said to allow Germany to show off its power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key software and hardware flaws that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also proved to be dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy is actually "lacking ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem increased over time because the old ships were being decommissioned and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow common and swamp bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats, at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be set up at key locations around the holdings to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile scans using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what species are doing.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelter and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mosquito nets and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their night-time hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary on Threave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge bat room", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good housing.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we are doing here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since accidental destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a spokeswoman for the Scottish Bat Conservation Society, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are progressing".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape allegations made against him as "fake news", saying that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 at the time to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a live video he posted to his 142 million Instagram followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they said today is fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's the way it is.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the footballer added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage" in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was 99% a good guy who was let down by that 1%.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of retaliation" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its car manufacturers
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, should Britain leave the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker said that the impact of border waiting in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience a production shutdown at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal because of the possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota's Derbyshire plant could not hold more than what was needed for one day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the "Chequers" plan Theresa May is offering for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers shows that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old worker in Burnston and a member of the Unite union, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back".
A government spokesman says: 'We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight continues over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a buzzword in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of announcing that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh lawsuits, further delaying much of the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The date is not set, it could be this week; it could be postponed for another week considering everything else going on with the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I always like to report everything to the press.
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of the "theatrical" behavior of television reporters, although she said, "I will not object to the fact that they are messing around".
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more meetings to answer questions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have analyzed the numbers".
Short talks will continue to happen, Sanders said, but if journalists have the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you've seen that in the last few weeks, and it's just that you can talk to the president of the United States and it's going to replace brief press conferences.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Health Minister has sent a letter to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wish to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He got to the line of the playground and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further tests.
A representative from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no details about the type/size of the injury and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shutouts before being out of the game, bringing his total to 18 shutouts for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
That move would neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and target those with high salaries.
The increase in fees will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee ̶ which is added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for issuance ̶ may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to integrate into the homeowners' society.
Many affluent areas in the country ̶ especially in the capital ̶ have become ̶ ghost towns ̶ because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking but not exploiting the land, and called on Mrs May to give up her quota on affordable housing to remedy the "shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced proposals for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to zero-tolerance evictions.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term to rebuilding the British dream - that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that non-UK residents, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as the UK's valuable citizens.
The dream of owning a home has become too distant for many people, and the shame of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become the Governor of Scotland.
The Scotsman (42) is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points behind the top-scorers.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always brought me back.
But that opportunity could only come if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul DiCanio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel afraid because he inherits such a big name at such a big club, having previously turned down calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy getting there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there.
Ross is just entering the third year of his managerial career, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months' experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from relegation to the championship the following season.
And Ross says he's feeling more comfortable than he's ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably a real crossroads", he remembered taking Alloe.
I really believed that management was what I was good at, more than acting.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making a solid living, and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management seems like the real thing.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life.

The perfect time to pint is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to research.
The summer heat wave boosted revenues for British pubs struggling financially, but added pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's business advisory, which collected the data, said: "The continued good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July would be similar to the previous June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 per cent, with restaurants now being hit even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly serve drinks, have made much higher profits on a level playing field compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs, where food is served, have also suffered from the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars operated, drinks sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell 3 percent".
Paul Newman, RSM's holiday and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual drop in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant managers, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed respite.
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, in July was 2.7%, reflecting the slowdown in the growth of the brand share.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry sales tracking system for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and establishes an industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they keep from their parents
A study reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social networking accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, open secret social networking accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Instagram accounts" referring to photo-sharing websites.
The news has reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a cleaned up "main" account to show their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One mother who found a secret Web site for her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged her by saying the words "rape me".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to tap into her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in high regard in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having him on the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the sports people and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, of his four Olympic golds, and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left unable to walk after a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and is now doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Internet opinions divided over a traitor's ad comparing mothers to cows
A company that produces cheaters with its ad comparing nursing mothers to cows that arouse husbands has divided opinion on the Internet.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the world's first silent wearable cheater, Elvie's consumer technology company released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that new cheaters give mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a barn full of hay and cows to music that says, "Yes, I'm a husband myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't whims, these are my breasts".
And then the chorus goes, "Pump, pump, I feed the baby with it, pump, pump, I husband my ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "wonders" of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth, one person wrote.
Elvie the traitor discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: "Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yeah, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone added: "Absolutely pointless advertising".
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she found the song "ridiculous".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Giving out milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product, she said.
Another person commented: This is a fun commercial aimed at mothers who give milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a cow.
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with discreet cheaters in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who deliver milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the breastfeeding.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie Selling Machine is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new betrayal will bring.
This isn't the first time the traitor Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children in sponsored care.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsoring household in the country are illegal, and a large number of them are criminal clients.
So we're continuing the search for these individuals", Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, in order to expedite proceedings for the children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear via videoconference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to statements by shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
Advocates said these concerns were expressed at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, signs of a child's distress are likely to be overlooked.
They add that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say hello to friends can cause the trauma many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territory is cleared of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that have encouraged the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for resuming political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited to a revision of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
There's no sign of spectator fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, hit-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed that by as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell said.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the abortion laws stemming from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
But you're going beyond the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used "deep background" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket, and the implications of intimate descriptions, this one, of Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria the same way again.
"Part of what it does to make you feel like a reality show is to feed you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Bail Bond", about the rotating cast and the daily complexities of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' home this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of the island of Kauai, with temperatures of about 27 degrees Celsius, but he was inside watching MSNBC and simultaneously recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
"I remember back in the day when we did all these crazy shows, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside is left in the most uncertain midterm congressional race
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This newly reorganized suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won the seat in the second district last spring in a special election.
Lamb is running against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the party's main fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. is considering whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then pull out.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to call in the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to proceed with a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The history
The next thing that's coming in could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible Trump obstruction of justice, which there is now very substantial public evidence of.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body just as he prepares to stand before the electorate again, and perhaps ultimately a jury of his peers.
There are many such "like" and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable downfall of Mr. Truman - or of the likes of him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only to be opposed by the West and backed by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these papers reported that he secretly proposed to film the president last year and speculated on his incompetence for service.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair... "or if he is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite compelling sexual assault and perjury charges?"
And above all, will we vote in a midterm congressional election that Mr. Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we won't fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the cork cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing the Rapids of Vienna
Rangers are on Thursday hosting Rapida from Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented teammate Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something done and we scored.
We might have stolen the game in the end, but, generally speaking, the tie is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Let's hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to start the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes known beforehand.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth ̶ as long as you have money.
Organize your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage health representatives to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Consider the following: Imagine that your aging parent is in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please include details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan handy.
Man shot multiple times from air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by air rifle shots as he returned home from a night out.

Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, emergency officials could not get any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 kilometers of coastline on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26th, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 degree storm hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Court of Veterans' Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend testified that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paluu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare execution for a federal crime not carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who crossed his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those points lead to a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck down a 22-count indictment against Saipov that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment states.
He also requested to hang an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a plea of guilty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics since one of the MPs, Theresa May, had suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have 'come out' by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May has faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tory remainder-minded people joining a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain her "Chequers" compromise plan amidst the attacks of the Brexiters, the Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wants to get rid of the Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick the Chequers out".
He said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Conservative and pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the march, addressing reporters with the words: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In a prominent message, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to "feel the pressure" if they are to fail the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us people and our political classes", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'you're not going to get away with it'.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists waved Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they had suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
"These are people telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plus plan, for unimpeded border conditions, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a live audience in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
She's been at the center of speculation for some time that she might run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the public since Trump took office.
A fellow speaker asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in charge.
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at a press conference on ET.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing a weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team lineup would play a big part in the race.
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pitch one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that reluctantly left the Ferrari driver free-in at risk of being held back after a double move in the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he relied on his tyres to get to the fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached the pits on lap 44, but failed to pick up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
"The team did a really great job of getting the formation finish", said Hamilton.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the only beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the publicity and the leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no, you know what?
I didn't.
Hold on a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
"I didn't withhold Dr. Ford's testimony, I didn't release her story to the public", Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.
However, her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting on Saturday night: "Let me tell you something - that was very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual assault, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges to their own ends.
They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get to power and control, are the words of the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for their defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead in the early minutes with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, exactly 3:35, with Kendall McFaul's assist, with David Rutherford's assist doubling the lead with Beauvillier's shot four minutes later.
In the rushed opening, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first quarter with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a goal-scoring draw at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to Dundee's first lead at the end of the second third, and he secured the win as his team was already halfway to victory in the final third of the game for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes team in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board the plane avoid the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport control tower which was rocking violently.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"Our hearts are breaking for this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be rising further, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many have not been found", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to 20 feet [6.0 m] in height destroyed the Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove an ambulance every minute the body was brought in.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is on the run to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people died in the earthquakes that struck Lombok, Indonesia.
Air Niugini now says one man is listed as missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that owns the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, they have been unable to track down any of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to locate the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to break through the water that was up to their waist to the exit in case of danger of a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby repairing the harbor also helped rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered air carriers over the last two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst's running a time-lapse on the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office on Saturday concluded the case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambers's at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and stated that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, at some point after Chambers' death, erased her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense should begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is enlightened hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singing group The High Breed argue that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and a focus on social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are being reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for firing them after a racist text.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected text from her mother calling her "another black woman".
The couple denied being racist, comparing the charge to sexual harassment.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned on her first day of work in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEEE ONE MORE NEGRATES", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "accidental" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, she claims, their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well, and she was expecting the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and demands compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was originally employed, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do such things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying that terminating Mauric's employment was a reasonable thing to do, for fear that she would be insulted and not be trusted later.
My wife didn't mean what she said in the message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on, you guys.
Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna sue someone who's in that situation.
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid readers wouldn't identify with the talking bear, revealed in the new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It's very amusing what we now know about Paddington's enormous success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man and was not a boastful one", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was perceived as an achievement of your own child: you were proud of him even though none of it was actually your doing.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit solely to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was really bad and that they believed he would not get out", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart working were slowly losing their effect and leaving her system.
She died just before boarding, and then everything went out.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going to happen next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all to myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I lowered my head, and tears flowed down my face the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Message from a grieving woman on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at age 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile who was looking forward to a brilliant career.
Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before his death he left the job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a negative effect".
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of the cards so people would know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on top of the world at Christmas when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or ask for anything else.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to get over it: "It leaves a huge hole in the family.
He's throwing us off.
But we're gonna keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought maybe we could bring in a little unity if we could really get something like what he was asking for - a time- and scope-limited investigation", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the board would fall apart amid a deep-rooted partisan blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was prompted by the choice of moment.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to bring the man of their choice to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush is constantly calling on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
The vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United South Federation Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapees last year compared to 2,706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and more fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of the northern refugees eventually became South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for making no progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not in our interests to disarm first under such circumstances", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like that, would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he can't participate in the Supreme Court's work because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she'd try to impeach Kavanaugh if he's confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll tell you what, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the federal court of appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade because she's considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse any Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'", Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has been building up for months and years - all of that can't be gotten rid of without a cry.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a former CEO and who said that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique where when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm mad at you.
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, is that one time, as I was crying with unspeakable rage, an older woman -- a cold-hearted manager who I had always been a little afraid of -- dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, then-Democrat congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another.
Someone called them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had already moved away, she was behind on fundraising, and vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her followers, who had given the men $1,000 each, had given her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was speaking out about not launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism - that her throat closed.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder, "the media reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were gonna put on my headstone.
She cried.
How a U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The onset of the U.S.-China trade war has echoed loudly, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently it imposed tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to hit back at the United States with a blow, and the world's second largest economy is certainly not about to give up.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger an economic meltdown in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow for strategic thinking focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to restore normalcy.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily life and existence are now met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water on the first stroke, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, the American, was sent off by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player in the European team, with 5 and 4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't stop crying today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
"It's all about the team, I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram, who in Sunday's singles match, defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods, 2 & 1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought".
At certain moments, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta take your hat off to people.
We're out of business.
New data on red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of red tide in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, heterogeneous algal blooming conditions are reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County areas ̶ indicating decreasing concentrations.
The red tide runs about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The blooming areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
A red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County or adjacent coastal area, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County coastal area, common to high concentrations in Manatee County, common to high concentrations in Sarasota County or adjacent coastal area, common to medium concentration in Charlotte County, common to high concentration in Lee County or adjacent coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory tract irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
