To assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in 14 days, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.

This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the cumulated incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.

Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.

Despite the fact that countries are in different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not submitted).
The Commission has adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment and the environment.
11 A study in 2010 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 individuals in 201011).

As cases have hitherto been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and as hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case and intensive care bed data should preferably be established at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent Rapid Risk Assessment by the CPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from an anti-virus approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been done in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

Coronavirus is traditionally considered a non-fatal pathogen for humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds 4.
None, over the course of this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
Covid-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1 outbreaks of pneumonia of then unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.

Meanwhile, the outbreak had spread rapidly to the cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.

23 January, Wuhan City was quarantined with all public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
February 11, 2020 A multi-centric study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spreading in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and outlying areas.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
Average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean time between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95 %: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (IC at 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (IC at 95%: 2.02-4.59%).

They can be classified into four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 was established as a new type of betacoronavirus, with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequentized samples taken from the outbreak's origin site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Under the use of transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
ACE2 in humans has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
ACE2 binds to human S protein less strongly than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
Sars-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by lorf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by lorf8.
orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit lIFNβ expression; however, lorf8 contains no known functional domains or patterns.
February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human lACE2's cryo-ME structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the amino acid carrier BAT1.

B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
host and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camellids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, bats have been promoted as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronavirus from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be elucidated.
Ji et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans through snakes, which would have involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers from Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-muzzle, ant-feeding mammal, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a gap of 1% between two genomes constitutes a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results for the establishment of concrete evidence should be expected (Fig.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.

At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Defendence: We can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Virus induces inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation and synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) by various means which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
N protein of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.

T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the defense cells.

Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
Antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
Somehow, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst-case scenario, multiviscereal failure or even death.
Sars-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home onset, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.

However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days for a range from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) was based on a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.

Covid-19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Some patients had dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.

Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest x-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that 98 percent of patients had fever, 76 percent had dry cough, 55 percent had dyspnea and 3 percent had diarrhea; 8 percent of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family and a household that developed from transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
In the same way, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).

Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
The main symptoms of SARS were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) and ventilation assistance was needed in approximately 14-20% of patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Comparatively, the mortality rate for SARS in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality was 37% for 2 494 confirmed cases.

The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Defendence: It is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of symptoms.
Including the use of the virus in patients with HIV/AIDS, the use of the virus in patients with HIV/AIDS and the use of the virus in patients with HIV/AIDS has been shown to be significant.
The patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
Lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4 × 109/L and a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109/L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high blood levels of hepatic enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.

In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
Type I and Type II pneumocytes dysfunction leads to a decrease in the rate of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
18 Feb 2020 Primal pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes disquamation, hyaline membranes formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multi-nuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
Despite the high rate of false-negatives, which can accelerate the outbreak, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.

February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows for the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than an hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will greatly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working on developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other ACE2 organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.

Respiratory assistance is therefore essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.

In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An overreaction of the immune system has been established to cause cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include T cell modulation of the immune response, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 report suppressor and dHDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.

However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Gilead has sent the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and results are highly expected.
Interferon-α, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have also been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of treatment with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.

In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Symptoms improved within 24 hours, combined with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose this method for large-scale use until no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully examined.

Thus, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes coding for the relevant antibodies or to look for effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.

The effects of the drug depend largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known at all as they are difficult to extract and verify, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a severe form of the disease.

However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the assessment.
Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study on February 18, 2020 that compared a treatment using Western medicine (WMD) only to a combination treatment combining WMD and TCM.
It was found that the time taken to return to normal body temperature, the time taken to resolve symptoms and the time taken to be hospitalized were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, the mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
THE efficacy and safety of TCM remain to be clarified through controlled trials conducted at larger scale and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.

In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric illnesses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.

Mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.

However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models subjected to lethal provocation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection remain to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In the Middle East and elsewhere, however, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur because of the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Different vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the long time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
️Most cases patients recover gradually without any complications.
None, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.

According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table33):
Âge:Âge was the main predictor of SARS, and it seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly individuals aged 30-65, with 47.7% over 50 according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
ACE2 positive cholangiocytes have also been established that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to positive lACE2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, treatment response and healing.

Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroid use has been widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors have had avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Dose of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental Stress: As described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to a large number of cases of exceptional stress, patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative that psychological support and long-term support be provided to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Deputational studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.

The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Continue to quarantine almost all of the population in order to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the outbreak.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the outbreak will end in March and that the decline phase will last for 3 to 4 months.

Paul Hunter et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go away in 2020.
Ira Longini et al., have developed a model to predict the outbreak and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.

Comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.

A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health professionals.

The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other people.
N95 masks (1860) provide protection against 10 to 80 nm inhalation of viruses, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure about 85 nm.
As the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear adjusted isolation jackets to further reduce contact with viruses.

22 January 2020 a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eyes due to inflammation.

For the populations of the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined as much as possible and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.

These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, must have placed China in a high state of alert following the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was low-contagious, had limited human-to-human transmission and would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has led to a notable release, particularly as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan has been missed.
The Commission has proposed that the Commission should adopt a decision on the basis of the information available.

The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing, it has spread to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Debate as this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is a preview impression.
Nothing is known about the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.

Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronavirus from bats, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 came from chiropractors.
What is the intermediate species that allowed transmission of the virus from the original host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the outbreak may resume at any time.
ACE2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?

How long will the outbreak last?

Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.

Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.

Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities seen in laboratory tests for suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increase in macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.

In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.

Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory illnesses.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and sustain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.

The four community HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the restriction factors of the host.
In this view, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the higher the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If adapted well, its transmission to men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.

Covs, on the other hand, can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reserve host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.

These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Enzyme converting human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate relative of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries were HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as were camels from the Middle East present in several countries in Africa.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion for bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

Alpha-CoV from the alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpha-CoV of alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
actually, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.

ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but encoded different ORF8 proteins.
ORF8 is subdivided into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presumed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
The following are the most commonly used methods for the analysis of recombination sites:
MERS-CoV epidemic has also been shown to have occurred in recombination between different strains, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
f4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV from alpaga has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a lag in the reading frame.
Evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.

Anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, for example, effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the VOC.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDOs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the VOC and affect the 'reading' by the exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
The most pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.

CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts like bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
here lies the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was split from the replication of the VC.

In order to stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
A number of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the VCs of bats, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
Culture of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.

They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonotic reservoirs.

The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;

Pneumonia, one of the leading causes of death among children under five years of age, which kills nearly 1.8 million people a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Impetigus, which is transmitted by direct physical contact, is also protected from hand washing.

The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are hardly soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
There is no evidence to date that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective and stress-relieving agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon found that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, in preventing disease and eliminating bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively kill germs.

The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened by skin emollients and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, emollient-containing hydroalcoholic solutions caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown a long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.

Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.

There are many economical alternatives to hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and pierced bucket or drain and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
Tipy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cotton candy jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.

Anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, for example, effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the VOC.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor and by the low expression rate of the major class I histotocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RDOs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress the replication of the VOC and affect the 'reading' by the exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
The most pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.

CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts like bats and camels.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
here lies the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was split from the replication of the VC.

Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Typ I interferon should therefore be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not successful in bats.
Inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.

While a beta-mouse-CoV that shares 95% of its nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat-CoV that shares 96% of its nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.

In order to stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
A number of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the VCs of bats, which have a very high zoonotic potential.
The chances are not missing for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new more transmissible and/or fatal human CoVs in the future.
Culture of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.

They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonotic reservoirs.

Confirmation of a suspected case must combine one of the epidemiological background characteristics with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a comprehensive analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan City and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive test for nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City or nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 weeks of contact with fever and respiratory symptoms, such as reduced office/respiratory symptoms, lessons in the classroom, lessons in the schoolroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
Diagnostication of confirmed case must be based on suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or modification of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive or increase in the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.

These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.

therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated given that they classified non-clinical symptoms as  low risk .
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
Finally, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to submit their comments.
Suspect cases and confirmed cases, we suggest that they follow and follow the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.

Woolworths also restricted home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
The measures follow the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its press release of 8 March, said that with the four-package restriction in place, many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery, and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it unanticipated.
Sales saw a sharp rise last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the permitted quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Retailers' Association of Australia's Executive Director, Russell Zimmerman, said retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local council's restrictions on truck delivery times made the task difficult.
It envisages higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in small quantities of stocks which, once depleted, leave large areas of empty space in beams, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
Coles and Woolworths consider that if the beams are full, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, stressed that they worked 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioneer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on holiday during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thrs edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page envelope to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited Andres toilet paper purchases to two 12-reel packages.
WHO classifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
WORLD HEALTH OG (WHO) on Wednesday declared the current COVID-19 outbreak (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) as a pandemic.
Pandemic only refers to the extent to which the disease spreads, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are to detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
We are very concerned not only about alarming levels of spread and gravity but also about alarming levels of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is unprecedented.
Apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued global spread.
We have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak:to sum up, the situation will get worse.
Associated Press  on Thursday  there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is a coronavirus disease outbreak that has been ongoing since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
L'épidémie a été détectée à Wuhan, en Chine, en décembre 2019, déclarée urgence de santé publique internationale le 30 janvier 2020 et reconnue comme pandémie le 11 mars 2020.

Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confining suspected infected persons.

The pandemic has led to serious socioeconomic disruptions globally, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and others from regions with many cases of the virus.
As a result of the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.

As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were present, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
Analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.

The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it might not include those who died untested - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Italia's partial data reveals that the surmortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
We know that [number of deaths announced] is underestimated, a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.

28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Antarctica was the only continent in which more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on 13 March.
The number of deaths in the population is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate is 6.0% (97,039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.

Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on estimates of mortality rates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by region.
Without control, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease becomes unavailable hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at the moment about when this will happen.
This could be completed by June if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said on March 17 that SARS-CoV-2  will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two .
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).
I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus because it's very easily transmitted will completely disappear and that it could turn into a seasonal disease, which could reappear every year
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.

The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
WHO states that about 1 in 6 people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult waking, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so the researchers made recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Asymptomatic ratio estimates in China range from a few to 44%.

The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly by close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).

It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).

Comparison of the entire genome has revealed up to 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolin is the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that  the scanner not be used to screen or as a first-in-first-out test to diagnose COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first appearance on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.

On 6 April 2020, none of these were proven reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in glass and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners to PCR and showed that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neuron networks have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies for preventing the transmission of the disease include having a good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.

CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughing, or sneezing.
Defendered by the fact that outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended that alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol be used when soap and water are not readily available.
SOMS advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within a minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a daycare center, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.

WHO has issued instructions on where and when to wear masks.
Purpose of wearing a mask is to reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.The use of masks has also been recommended for those caring for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they are facing a significant risk, for example if they are caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it recognizes that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.

Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory for all outings, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask for those who cannot afford it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.

Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in the areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of gatherings recommended by the US government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10.
Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people on March 22, 2020. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The use of the term social distancing led to the belief that total social isolation should be used, instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means.Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.

Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation.Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in the affected areas.

Epidemic control strategies are: mitigation and eradication.
Lendiguement is set up in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Menuination and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Elimination requires more extreme measures to inflate the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Pharmaceutical non-interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as closing schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and has issued travel warnings for infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have quarantined themselves, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies.Simulations for the UK and US show that mitigation (slowing down but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (turning back the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
optimal mitigation policies can reduce healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.
Elimination may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because otherwise transmission bounces quickly upon release of measures.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.

Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use may worsen the results.
A number of compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has stated that some  traditional and handmade remedies  can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to redistribute resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions wherever possible, separating and isolating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available fans and beds.
There are various theories as to the origin of the first case (called patient zero).

December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a  coronavirus similar to SARS .

Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to start an investigation in early January.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway hub.

National responses have included measures of containment such as quarantine (also called stay-at-home, stay-at-home or lockdown orders) and curfews.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are under some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were experiencing some form of confinement, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later  about a third of the world's population.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the outbreak.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of covertness hindering prevention and response efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government regularly reported on the lunar New Year's eve to avoid panic.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO Representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was certainly not a WHO recommendation, it was a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated and he spoke of an unprecedented fact in the history of public health. On 30 January, following confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside of China and an increase in cases in other countries, WHO declared that the epidemic was an international public health pandemic (IPP) that was being declared as the APPI pandemic since 2009.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that USPPI was due to the risk of global spread, particularly for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
There is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade and the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.
February 5, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support those countries that  do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear .
Tedros then declared that we were  as strong as our weakest link and urged the international community to  invest today or pay more tomorrow. On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
The same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the  strength of the entire UN system into the  response.
The WHO has activated a UN crisis management team to coordinate the entire UN response, which will allow them to focus on the health response while other agencies can bring their expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.
February 14, a joint mission team led by WHO was activated in China to send international and WHO experts on site to China to support national management and assess  the severity and transmission of the disease  by holding workshops and meetings with leading national institutions and conducting field visits to assess  the impact of provincial and county response activities, including in urban and rural areas . On February 25, WHO said The world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of , indicating that although it is too early to talk about a pandemic, each country should enter the preparation phase .
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to the site to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO representatives said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from a very high level to a very high level, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Programme, warned in a statement: This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared, adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid the worst.
Ryan went on to say that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that we accept absolutely that every human being on the planet is exposed to this virus.
March 11 WHO declared that the coronavirus outbreak could be called a pandemic.
The Director-General indicated that WHO was  extremely concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction.WHO faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, in particular because of the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
26 Mar 2020 Dozine of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Experts emphasized that every individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.

The US administration of Donald Trump has labeled the coronavirus as  Chinese virus  or  Wuhan virus , stating that  in China  censorship has overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic , which has since been labeled racism by some opponents and intended to  divert attention from the administration's inability to contain the disease .
The Daily Beast obtained a US government telegram exposing the broad outlines of a communication ploy apparently coming from the National Security Council, whose strategy cited is as follows: Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every way possible, including at press conferences and on television. Press agencies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to gain global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and 'generosity politics'.
China insists aggressively that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending a priori aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other conflicts related to masks have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey has also seized hundreds of respirators for Spain.
Early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union towards Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, indicated that only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.
22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian Army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
Anonymous political source quoted by the Italian newspaper La Stampa who said that 80 percent of Russian aid was little or no use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of embarking on a charming  geopolitical and diplomatic  offensive.

Russia has also sent a cargo plane for medical assistance to the United States.
By offering his assistance to his American colleagues, he [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to repay them as needed.
The scale of NATO's planned military exercise  Defender 2020  in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
Defender 2020:In the current public health crisis, it puts not only the lives of US troops and many participating European countries at risk, but also the lives of the people in the countries where they operate.The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran.The epidemic sparked calls for the United States to adopt common social policies with other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanaging the epidemic by the government or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.

The technology sector in particular has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100.
This demand has led to prices rising up to 20 times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will put healthcare professionals at risk.

The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been envisaged in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy saw no significant decline in agricultural production, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food beams were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government members unlocked pork reserves to ensure sufficient subsistence for the population.
In Italy, similar laws exist to ensure that food producers store supplies for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy have been felt in China: according to a media report dated March 16, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
The mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, and the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerged of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the outbreak on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-04 SARS outbreak.
An expert from Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global logistics chain could have an impact of over $300 billion over two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly went bankrupt after oil prices fell sharply due to declining demand in China.

Anticorps detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to report or asymptomatic people.
The results of this test can be used to determine an exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity among the population.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
The number of deaths reported in the EU is likely to be significantly affected by this variability, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal cleavage or expectoration.

RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of disease.
Afterwards, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
Infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken into the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or a spit (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).

E gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing their real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reintermediate Resource Agency.
Among the earlier versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests yielded inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were given permission to start screening.

March 19, 2020 the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system.

FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Abbott plans to scale up production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
Lung X-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of TMD [tomography] may be conclusive even before symptoms appear.
Typical symptoms seen in DMT include multi-lobal bilateral opacity in decolorated glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TMD in Wuhan, where the current pandemic originated, suggested that TMD is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
The American College of Radiology recommends that TMC not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
Anticorps production, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be done in central laboratories (TCLs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCTs).
The automated broadband systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.

Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that had duly informed the Agency and that can now distribute their antibody testing.
After March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
The emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube, patients will spit inside, send it back and later receive the test result.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspect cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used.
drive centres have enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screening in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated on 2 March that it had the capacity to perform some 12 000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10 700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
Cost is covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.

The South Korean government has increased the capacity of screening, largely in private sector laboratories, over the years.
16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow down the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of detergents and chemical reagents have been exhausted.

In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had  defects . The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a high  error rate  and that it did not use them . The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.

WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and limited experience of COVID-19 in their national laboratories send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
Positive in % of tests  depends on the national screening policy in the following table.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a higher test positive percentage than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, with the other factors being the same.

hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;

A study conducted in 2013 suggested that improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.

The introduction of actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea by about a third, a figure comparable to that achieved by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhea by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs).
Pneumonia, one of the leading causes of death among children under five years of age, which kills nearly 1.8 million people a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
UNICEF: "If you wash your hands with soap before eating and after going to the bathroom, you can save more lives than any other vaccine or medical intervention, and you can cut the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter".

A Danish study from 2012 found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or skin dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in healthcare workers.
Overfrequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (miction, defecation), after cleaning a baby's ass (or changing her diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.

The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are hardly soluble in water.

Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Liquid soap vending machines are preferred
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for those concerned about their health.
There is no evidence to date that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.

Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective and stress-relieving agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the School of Public Health at the University of Oregon found that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, in preventing disease and eliminating bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not help reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for the hands or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickener such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to produce a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively kill germs.

Primary: The palm and back of both hands should be faced together and the fingers and nails should be interstitially faced for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
You should also wipe your fingertips by rubbing them, palm to palm.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may lead to skin dryness if the formula is not strengthened by skin emollients and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, emollient-containing hydroalcoholic solutions caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown a long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.

Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.

Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the following steps:

Sapone removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotate for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinsing in running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can result in re-contamination of hands.
Dry with a clean towel or outdoors.

Hydrating lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin promotes the development of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection.
There are many economical alternatives to hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and pierced bucket or drain and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
Tipy-tap is a simple technology that uses a cotton candy jar suspended by a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Efficient hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.

In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air-jet hand dryers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the pulp of the fingers by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.
Airjet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the device and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows the spread of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
The paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryer has been compared to paper towels.
Laving hands with disinfectant towels is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Solution hydracolic must contain at least 60% alcohol.

In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after you have been to a sick person.
Concerning the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefit to increasing hand washing frequency by more than 35%.

In most rural Africa, for example, it is rare to find handwashing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
A lack of soap or water can also be attributed to persistent habits.
Promoting hand washing with soap and raising awareness can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap washing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and social marketing campaigns are less effective. In promoting handwashing in schools, UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
Construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that claims to encourage behavior change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy living earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing  the British.

Middle exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high population density work environments and some large-volume retail environments.

Finally, shipments of items from geographic regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
Planes take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as old age or chronic pathologies.

Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Equipment for personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing labels, including covering their mouths and noses for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage bags, preparing for remote work or scheduled working hours as needed, dissuading workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever controls or other symptoms-acting medications. They also recommend that employees be able to stay home to care for a sick family member and that employees be informed of these policies.
OSHA notes that jobs at medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), with people who are not suspected or known to have COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of an ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person recently travelled internationally to a region with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and installation of a drive-glass window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, conducting in-person meetings through virtual communications, protecting the stages of work, providing non-essential travel equipment to meet the risk of COVID-19 and other workplace safety measures, including providing a means of protecting workers' hands and hands, providing a means of protecting workers' hands and hands, and providing a means of protecting workers' hands and hands, and providing a means of protecting workers' hands and hands, and providing a means of protecting workers' hands and other workers' health, including the use of screens, and providing a means of protecting workers' hands and protecting workers' hands from COVID-19 disruption, and providing a means of protecting workers' hands and protecting workers' hands from the spread of COVID-19 disruption, and other disruption, and providing a means of protecting workers's safety and disruption of the spread of COVID-19 disruption.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following: separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a protective mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when they cough or sneeze.
Cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
The use of the use of the product in the transport of dangerous biological waste is not limited to the use of the product in the transport of dangerous biological waste. The use of the product in the transport of dangerous biological waste is limited to the use of the product in the transport of dangerous biological waste.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the isolationist's cabin.For schools and childcare, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimum to moderate Community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choral courses or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, scheduling arrival and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of a major transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered.
Police officers who have to come into contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a household detergent towel or spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE as well as containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be in categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Exposure-high-risk jobs include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulation of samples of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
The procedures producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
Exposure high-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they go to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy.Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.

The samples must be handled using Level 3 biosecurity precautions.
WHO recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPIs, OSHA recommends breathing masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory filtration masks or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide greater protection and greater worker comfort. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the entry point.
WHO recommends for those who collect breathing samples, care for or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedures, surgical masks, protective glasses or facial screen, blouse and gloves.

Due to the insufficient global supply of EPPI, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a COVID-19 patient's premises to those directly involved in their care, using only the EPPs needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the EPP supply chain, and dissuading the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjusta­tions in our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
In this conversation we considered what we thought would be the appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organisation during this period.


To all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work time target will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful in the mission.

There are certain things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Confiance &amp; Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to work twice as much to catch up with the time lostwhen the pandemic is over.

We recognize that circumstances have changed and we will endeavour to set new objectives and timetables where appropriate.
What about the annual planning?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time objectives, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan which provides more time to budget so that employees can focus on essential work, taking care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines greatly reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmed.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.

Our colleagues who are used to working remotely know that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to sessions of one or two hours maximum.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Definir claramente la reunión, tener un orden del día y enviar la documentación por adelantado.
Make videos the norm, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare refund for snacks.
Join the Slack channel #remoties to talk to your work distribution colleagues
The HR operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients of the community grant to cancel Wikimedia funded public events, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.

It is a matter of acknowledging that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we feel are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to give our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our planned work will be here waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.

Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Lenzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of dangiotensin II and increasing the ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
enzyme human version is often referred to as hACE2.
angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter colectin domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
ACE2' s extracellular domain is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resultant soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: lACE2 is bound to the cell membrane mainly by type II lung alveoli cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle blood cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
ACE2's primary function is to compensate for the ACE.
ACE clivs the vasoconsisting hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn clivs the carboxyl terminated amino acid phenylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, lapelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Cell surface binding of SARS-CoV spicular protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of lACE2 results in lendocytosis and translocation of both virus and lenzyme into the endosomes inside cells.
This entry process also requires the transformation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 serine host protease, which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment.This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment with ACE and ARB inhibitors should continue.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that  the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those suffering from stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia.
Enzyme converting human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is presumed to be an innovative treatment for severe lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high circulation of dangiotensin II. RhACE2 in perfusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Apps for COVID-19 are mobile apps designed to facilitate contact tracking in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identification of people ( contacts ) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.

Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided as open source and will be given to the government.North Macedonia has launched  StopKorona!, a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
After the 14th of April 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
Contact tracking application is at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning to deploy applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a georepairing application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and living in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has highlighted several possible practical problems associated with the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of the population uses the application.
Coronavirus fake or harmful apps, Apple only allows official or generally trusted organisations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications in mass surveillance, especially the possible dismantling of surveillance infrastructure created to cope with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
The following are the main objectives of the programme:
supervision should be legal, necessary and proportionate;
the control and surveillance extensions should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of the fight against COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated in a way that is protected;
the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and with Article 21 thereof;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
significant participation  of all  relevant stakeholders  would be mandatory, in particular that of public health experts and marginalized groups.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network geolocation systems have been used instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present important potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems based on central servers need to access personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers for intercommunication only, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).

Rather than using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then combined to send SMS alerts to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following profound changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak that affected that country.
Information is publicly available through several applications and websites.Countries such as Germany have considered using centralized systems to preserve privacy.
Details were not yet disclosed on 6 April 2020.
Privacy contact tracing is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-related solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
The PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.

Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many attempts at development are underway.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared in late February 2020 that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, until at least 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak was reported worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investment and research in developing a vaccine.

Define in April, the imperatives of the ICES initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.

The main platform targets in Phase I security studies include:
DNA and RNA (vaccine developer and candidate phase I: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (vaccine developer and candidate phase I: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) have been confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or design).
A phase I-II trial carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo controlled and performed in multiple centres, determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the vaccine' s effectiveness in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in preclinical research).
About January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pin vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
About January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they had begun work on a vaccine, whose human trials are expected to begin in 2021.

Virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during the later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.

This is called the incubation period.
Inkubatory period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under study.The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

A study in Singapore found that a cough without protection can drop droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors located in the corridor outside patients' rooms produced viral RNA positive samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spreading through stool, this risk is perceived as low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although it may be possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others.
The virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
This however varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Sapone and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products break down the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables it and eliminates skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.

Plunges are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the host cells via the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
Spicule  (peplomer) is a specific surface glycoprotein used by the virus to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.

ACE2 receptors in the heart may also be associated with acute myocardial lesions.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis.
ACE-2′s epithelial cells are tropic to SARS-COV-2, but severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
IL6 secretion inflammatory monocytes recruitment and severe lung pathology of COVID-19 patients have been associated with GM-CSF secretory T cells in particular.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
Testing is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or expectoration sample may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.

Anticorps tests (which can detect active infections and previous infections of a person) were being developed on 4 April 2020, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experiment revealed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first test nearest to the patient on March 21, 2020 for use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobal opacity in glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms seen at the beginning of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with progression of the disease.

The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
4 types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: edema pulmonary, hyperplasia pneumocytata, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
ADD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxemia.
exudate organization in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leukoblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering mouth and nose with a sleeve when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow when there is no sleeve.

CDC recommended that people in public places cover their faces with a cloth to limit transmission in asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling important gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
No medicines are known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called flatten the curve .
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after wet, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends that a hand sanitizer solution with alcohol content of at least 60% alcohol be used, but only if water and soap are not available.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not an active antiseptic substance for the hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care which may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy eating have been recommended to promote immunity.
WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
IBCC, a free resource, has been compiled by several U.S. resuscitation physicians and pneumologists with therapeutic recommendations from several agencies.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
ibuprofen as the first line of treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in care conditions where the performance of procedures may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that healthcare professionals treating people with COVID-19 be placed in an airborne infection-appropriate isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends facial protective screens or, as a last resort, handmade masks.

Reflectional assistance for people with COVID-19 respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people.Some evidence indicates that intubation can be prevented using a high-speed nasal cannula or positive pressure from the double-level airways.
It is not known whether either or both of these benefits the same for people in a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the capacity of the healthcare system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.

ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
Clinical trials are underway for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under test are already approved in other indications and testing is already in progress.
Antiviral medicine may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA granted temporary approval for plasma from people recovering as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
Has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for disease.
February 2020 China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.

20%-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
The same report found that the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five days in hospital.
Hospitalisation and death were average of seven days in patients transferred to intensive care.
In an early case study, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Postmortem pulmonary samples have been subjected to histopathological examinations showing diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
Image of the lung resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).

The number of people who have been admitted to hospital in the United States is estimated to be around 89% of those who have been admitted to the hospital in March.
The estimates of the mortality rate from the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.

March 2020  It was not known whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.

The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications reported the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.

The number of patients with HIV/AIDS in the UK is estimated to be around 1,5% of the total population.
2019-s, WHO assigned the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Johns Hopkins University statistics show that the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from the disease and the infectious mortality rate (IRF) which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.

Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.

69 fatalities (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as COVID-19 related.
Pandemic impact and mortality rates differ between men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in men in their 50s, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% in males and 1.7% in females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be among them.
The development of co-morbidities such as hypertension in men at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called  coronavirus  and  Wuhan coronavirus .
WHO recommended in January 2020 that the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV be used for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of place names in disease and virus names.

Due to the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as sinks and breathing parts.
When an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
Besides the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.

Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicular protein that starts with serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE receptor 2.
oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was conducted.
He is currently undergoing a nationally randomized Phase 2 trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected individuals.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of a different-cause steroid-refractory cytokine re-expand syndrome, CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
There is no randomised and controlled evidence to date that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CFS.
Concentrated and purified antibody transfer produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
