Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two sides agreed to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising actions in the Middle East.
The meeting will also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution being discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington has criticized Israel's ongoing settlement building and accused Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal Obama has been promoting on Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress, at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not cancelled, but Obama had refused to meet him, citing the upcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
In a 911 call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police, in a somewhat trembling voice, that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block that read, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me". This was stated in the letter, which was signed by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, another death had occurred: Lamm took his own life when the police locked him up.
A day after the university shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as the testimony of students and staff who knew him, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Social Sciences and History departments, which have 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, stating that he had some medical problem.
He only taught two online classes this year.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic path to an assistant professorship.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping the campus, police later tracked Lamb's entry back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to that house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and education.
He got his PhD in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar for a few years.
He was the ladies' man then.
All the girls would melt away when he was there", said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss were together for a while.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife", but there was no marriage certificate.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that borders a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was totally devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were the best of friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both performing at a summer carnival three years ago.
Later, they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were cleaning up and joking around.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the late professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student body.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, approximately 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members attended a candlelighting memorial Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students to come back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the 911 call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb did refer to Prentiss as his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to reduce staff for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it will not be hiring as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give its current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it planned to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and added 45,000 more workers over the Christmas period in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin recruitment interviews this month and increase the number of employees from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a big moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it's becoming clear to me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film, "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it occurs to me that I'm a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"It is, to me", Spielberg said, "unquestionably the greatest time-travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be released on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation insoluble".
The five permanent members were asked to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they had shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polling points that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have Donald Trump leading in the double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of the nomination.
Of course, it's too early in the election cycle.
Nobody's saying that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's resilience and are starting to pour their dollars into bringing him down.
Here are some recent polling figures that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are stuck in the early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "pleased" if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson is about as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were to run.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting remarks, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post reported on Monday.
The same number is true in the nation's first voting state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he lacks the personality to effectively run the office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change from the time four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, versus only 28% for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet, it appears that a large number of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump garners the majority support.
He's leading Carly Fiorina by 13 points, ahead of Marco Rubio by 14, ahead of Walker by 15, ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33.
It's a head-to-head with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their ballots firmly.
Of course, much can be done to change this, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competitor right now is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made up their minds are twice as likely to be for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a focal point of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic rhetoric will alienate key Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so, apparently, will Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government is at an all-time high.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of Republican voter support, largely due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new Monday poll from ABC/Post say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "displeased" and 21 percent "hell-bent".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the North Sea.
On the street, the average cost of a square meter of a thatched house is $73,300.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited", the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows which specific locations have the highest cost per square meter.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student lounge in Munich is not really a small amount.
Unlike Germany's top-rated resorts, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential areas - with prices per square metre at staggering heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros of nix per square metre, you will have noticed.
But, well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
The double-goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller opened the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it was over.
A glorious start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Witch's Cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League against the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52. / 90. +2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth success in the series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkel pot to Munich in the third round.
Müller received his 28th goal in the Champions League against Bayern with the help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who passed a shot from the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them", Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match in Karaiskakis Stadium to 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed performance without glitter.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the top flight, including against big clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, unbeaten in seven European Cup matches against Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were bold, but often unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a play-off shift to left-back Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right, as his flank from the right half-field hit the top left goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best chances in the first half were Robert Lewandowski's.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the head ball of the Pole from the line (26).
Then, by direct tackle, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with the knee (35).
Although the Bavarians drew their usual dominating game, Piraeus was able to put up needle stitches.
But there was no confidence in goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
For example, when he shot a shot of Ideye across the bar (56).
Guardiola defended a four-way tie with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, who was back in the squad after a muscle problem, was initially sidelined.
The World Cup winner only gave the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to do something else, that is already evil".
Guardiola also decided against him in the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76) and cleared the field 13 minutes later, with Müller adding another goal per half-hour.
Before the game, there had been a riot in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported from the stadium.
Smokers are at higher risk of tooth loss
Smoking harms not only the lungs but also the teeth - as suggested by a long-term study in Potsdam, Germany.
The good news is, if you don't, the risk goes down fast.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the conclusion of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several members of the staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared with non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasises.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to a higher incidence of gum disease in smokers.
It was not clear to what extent smoking also increased the risk of caries.
But people who quit smoking may reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than a decade for the risk to return to the level of nonsmokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England.
"Smoking shortens life expectancy", said Heiner Boeing, head of the DIfE study, who said that people need to be persuaded to become non-smokers.
Not smoking is good for your lungs and blood vessels, and we've found that it also leads to good dental health well into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, according to the DIfE.
Previous research has suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists on the banks of the Rhine River in Cologne find late-Ancient remains
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Roman-German Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction of the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called "ground monuments".
The museum is always involved in all construction projects in the Cologne district as the specialist department for archaeological landmark maintenance.
The archaeologists have now found the third construction section of the Rhine Boulevard.
The text documents had already been known that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman was injured in an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asked the public for help.
Early Wednesday morning, at about 1:40, the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, the train caught her and she suffered the most serious injuries.
She was treated by emergency medical personnel and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The reason for the young woman's crossing the railway at night is not known to the investigating officers.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
The question is from the residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the Federal Police's free 24-hour hotline on 0800/6888000 or from any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in TTIP dispute
To defuse the dispute over the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the EU Commission has proposed a major overhaul of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between groups and states are thus to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning is much more similar to traditional courts.
"We want to create a system that citizens trust", said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch.
The Swedish government intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position to the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration system specifically provide for the EU and US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to be equally divided between the EU, the US and third countries.
The second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow the right to appeal against judgments.
The parties to the proceedings had so far agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of appealing against their judgments.
The discussion over the past few months has made it clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the drafting of the draft budget.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the matter.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) procedure, which is being sought by large corporations in particular, is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Opponents of traditional arbitration have criticized it as a kind of parallel justice, where companies can sue for damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws, or enforce lower consumer and environmental standards.
In initial comments, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they did not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a great step forward.
The Commission is taking into account the main points of the reform that were worked out by the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the business community's legal capacity by too many new rules.
The Commission's proposal is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
The EU's trade policy is based on the principle of free trade and the principle of free trade.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
The agreement was originally due to be framed by the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered to be tenable.
Delikater Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg, Germany, is a song by the German band The Clash.
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flip chart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience of about 40 is almost overwhelmed by Stevens' talk.
He uses various locations, which he repeatedly draws on the map, to tell the story of his meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" cleverly composed songs appear, which harmoniously nestle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into great opulence at any time.
Rumor has it that "Michigan" is the first in a daring series of songs that will be performed in each of the 50 states.
But in 2004 and in the Rhine area, "Seven Swans" was already published and it breaks certain positive expectations.
Stevens is playing a reduced version.
He's got a guitar and a banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the show.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") was released in 2005 and is a nationally acclaimed masterpiece.
Filled with ideas and stylistic sophistication.
The album climbs to number one on the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year-end list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then uses The Age of Adz (2010) very extensive electronic replacement pieces.
This sixth studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and hall.
Long after the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon rainbow bands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger More!
The theatre presents the main show, "Carrie and Lowell", which has been on the air since March.
Though nearly 2,000 guests are now confined to their chairs, the much more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play through the richly enriched album.
The audience is told that the talk is "more opulent" and that it can "basically throw away the record".
Stevens humbly thanks him for an extra part, plays a few older songs acoustically, and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's first question time with the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly anticipated.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is set to make his debut at the prime minister's question and answer session, and take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-set questions shortly after lunch, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less drama and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to give them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood by in respectful silence" and he had recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences on the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the cap on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour would table amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow minister for work and pensions, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposed to the government's plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, across the parliamentary dispatch box in the last decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has crowd-sourced ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "bumping" and arguing with counter-hooks and instead has decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also brought up the idea of other colleagues speaking occasionally and that he had approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the politics of the "Kasperley theatre" often associated with the prime minister's question time, but a few years later he admitted he had failed to do so.
First broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader's judgement and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': homeless youths trained to be photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be if you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living from it.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose sharply following data showing an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period of the previous year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of a rate hike.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with a rise of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the dominant stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury goods firm Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are growing again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
The stock of the packaging and paper company Mondi was the biggest loser on the index, falling by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set its valuation for the company Rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1%, after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But he said it was unlikely that this purchasing power would offset the higher labor costs at his company.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, the star of the show.
A young man of 21 years old, a little handful with a very fine beard.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
More than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17s are going crazy.
Such as the case of Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
Among them are Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7am, however, the polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin Luxury Hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: this is the home of her idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite the Canadian singer is staying in costs her the same amount per day as her mama Ewa earns in six months.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria should be in tenth grade in high school".
"I'm fulfilling her dream".
School time?
Who cares about it?
The fans don't.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He's already done it.
He made $3 million for the Super Bowl commercial, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company, and he put a lot of money into Bieber's account.
And every time a doll that looks like him walks across the counter, Bieber's cashing in, too.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you look out the window.
He is said to have made over 100 million dollars.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others point out that Bieber is currently in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" number one.
Even Bieber, whose fourth album is due in November, doesn't care about the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to the potato bowl idea
Potatoes or donuts?
It can do both - and it can do so in the potato doughnut developed by Hani Alhay, a restaurant owner in Oldenburg.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes instead of donuts" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
He got the idea from a poster he had seen on TV at a Pegida demonstration, which read "Potatoes instead of donuts".
Since then, his shop has been running a barbecue with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach", says Alhay.
The Lebanese man has now registered his idea with the patent office in Munich.
The Commission has recently granted it protection as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the dish contains.
He just says, "It tastes better when you put it together".
His customers also welcome the culinary international understanding.
Metcash launches ground-based campaign to combat Aldi-
Metcash is trying to protect IGA branches from an Aldi surge in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a groundbreaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands like Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, beverage and appliance wholesaler holds its annual Investor Strategy Day.
The stakes are high, with South Australia and Western Australia accounting for nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store business and generating higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that within 12 months of opening its first markets, Aldi will grab about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Africa and 30 in Western Australia next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and grocery revenue to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and to reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and grocery business, which serves approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while pressuring sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to match retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to help IGA retailers improve their stores by growing faster fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and store renovation programs will increase at Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior, according to Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who are often referred to as "Special Ks", has been thrust into the limelight by Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit the kid".
While he was last seen crushing a tennis racket after a cramp foiled a potential U.S. Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite jealous of is the fact that I think Thanasi has been dragged into the controversy a little bit", said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost the US Open to a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of that.
But, really, he did extremely well at the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been a little bit overreacted.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to not consider Kyrgios in the important pre-season decision that starts on Friday, describing the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the Canberra man that he will return to the team as a long-term fixture".
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has done very quickly the kind of ascension that people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's rising in the public eye, and he's made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time away from the spotlight, where he can just think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone trying to enter the country illegally, all in an effort to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's-land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled the violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations were mounting.
As a police helicopter hovered above them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police on alert.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
The EU is also calling for the EU to take action to combat terrorism and to ensure that all its citizens are protected.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people who had sought refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU countries would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on any immediate action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia, and also impose higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to give its procedural approval for the military deployment, which is expected to take place next week, but Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered deeper into the country.
They come over here, they damage the fence, they're now in police custody and they're being charged with committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed wire train arrived to close the borders.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and a crowd of people pushed to get inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll halved
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (58 percent before), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is receiving support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primary.
With more than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say what candidates they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their voting than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton has a big lead in women and moderates, but those leads have decreased.
Her support among the men has fallen off a lot, and Sanders is only five points behind here.
Clinton's lead in the Democratic under-50s has faded, and she and Sanders are now on equal footing.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double digits in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are most enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The agreement to deal with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
With the vice president putting a potential candidate for the presidency on the ballot, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primary would like to see him in the race - though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who their second choice for the party would be, Biden is in the lead.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is second by a long shot in this measure, but the percentage who see him as the "most electable" has risen.
Yet, when asked what is more important about a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters in the primary.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on several key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the top candidate in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
All these polls, about a quarter of the Democratic voters don't have a view of Sanders.
With questions continuing to be asked about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public at large.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the matter was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
While Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent view her as honest and trustworthy, down eight percent from last month and 15 points since May.
62% of the voters don't think she's an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score highest on honesty.
A majority of people think Sanders is more honest, but like Carson, many people don't think he's honest.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump in the national poll.
Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and the others are losing ground dramatically.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson went from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well-received among demographic groups and trump outranks among republican voters with college education.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is down with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the most, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 persons of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls - he's at 19 percent support among Republicans, behind Trump at 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a rising Carson last week, Trump found some collateral damage for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees Celsius.
Even if peak values are measured only at a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to find still warm water.
A swim in the North or Baltic Seas is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people are not going to the sea anymore: The water in the North and Baltic Seas this week has reached a maximum of 18 degrees, according to the German weather service (DWD).
The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures, with temperatures reaching up to 29 degrees in the east.
In the Adriatic, it's 25 degrees at the top, in France, 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is getting to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College freshman.
Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are being charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to cross a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members failed to call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide utensils and put the welfare of the Brotherhood above the welfare of Michael Deng", said Police Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment. At least one student has died from harassment every year since 1970", Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a charge of murder in the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with inciting racial riots and forming a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to hold the people responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
That's what's gonna happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike comes along, and the housing market will falter, bond yields will go up, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this is going to last and how long it's going to last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within only 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
That's why Fed officials have been so vocal about the need for investors to focus not on when the Fed will start raising interest rates, but rather on how long it will take for the economy to return to normal.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement over an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The first Fed hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect a gradual return to normal US interest rates, but still too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
But that doesn't mean there won't be any impact.
Here is a look at how some sectors of the economy might respond, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the elevation occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset returns to be choked off 12 to 24 months after the first rate hike, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed raises interest rates.
More specifically, the market has been mostly upwardly for the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to higher interest rates, fairly flat for the 250 days after that (average gains of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on equities tends to occur later in the cycle of increases and the yield starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of life, but rising interest rates often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is particularly remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate increases since 1950, only twice has nominal GDP been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, and only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether this time it will be different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading gives only a 25% chance.
"In our study, all the increases from 1950 to today have occurred in a super-cycle of increasing GDP momentum, eclipsing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began", the report said.
On the contrary, this is clearly a slow recovery from what has been the worst recession on record.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market avoids an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than that of stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first rise/fall in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the cycle of increases, bond yields immediately fall, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge and flatten the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns", said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve has flattened, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed is tightening its policy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as will their debt financing.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on equity and low stock volatility also outperformed their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "deadening"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they were just imitating The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the programme The Voice and said that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 'turning' to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament, adding new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that private stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public service broadcaster was "dumbing down" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be The Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you are really just imitating what is already on the market", Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I'll never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and to making music that's really unmatched.
"And Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works, I think is really important too", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work needs to be done to engage the audience than has been done in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, to come under fire during the hearing at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee for trampling on the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC One show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hoped the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time they launch an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more episodes of The Voice in the future or spending fee-takers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales were the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month saw the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago as mobile phones became the go-to shopping tool
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has slowed down spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have become ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five per cent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, it has always evolved over time", said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG Sales Index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales started to increase three years ago when shoppers started using their phones to shop.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, like at home on the couch.
But now it's shifting, and we may see that growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that shoppers are holding off on shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times the average number of shoppers have gathered at their computers to make their bargains, and some retail websites have crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers fought over bargains, could discourage shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets of Mecca for the first burial
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse in part of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Mourners, dressed mostly in white, filled the streets to pay their respects as the first of the dead began their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed the Holy Place where just days before, a construction crane had crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents at the Grand Mosque before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already pledged that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands more coming to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the crane arm standing when it was not being used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statements on the de Kran collapse and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not taking up-to-date safety measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounding Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the Saudi ruling family for decades, undertaking major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was dispossessed by the family in the 1990s.
The crane's collapse came amidst strong winds and rain, just days before millions of people were expected to arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every healthy Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured persons will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the days of cheap Eastern European craftsmen are over
The UK is increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This will result in the opening of 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
This is Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail.
It is claimed that the British are abandoning their hammer and brush in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes.
If you can handle a hammer or a paintbrush to paint walls, you are apparently in the minority today.
The head of the company behind B&Q says that Britons are increasingly employing artisans to do home-made jobs in their homes.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the chain of home-made stores, said that a large increase in the number of skilled eastern European artisans offering low-cost services had been overtaken.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen and to close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the staff is predominantly male.
She said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more single female households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: 'There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We must shift this more towards balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the purchasing decisions being made by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a leading UK company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of its team of women, including its executive and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group had to bear the cost of closing stores.
Because of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will be opening 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials in court for breach of trust
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob were charged with fraud and tax evasion by the regional court in Klagenfurt.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been postponed.
According to the Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged during the preliminary investigation that the defendants used for private purposes between 2006 and 2011 funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions.
The damage is estimated at about 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also facing financial crimes charges.
The Chairwoman of the Schöff-Jury, Judge Michaela Sanin, ruled out this fact.
It's to be negotiated at a later date.
The defence argued that the club had never suffered a financial loss.
The sports officials had only paid compensation for expenses and had paid out the debts of the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schillings (approximately EUR 44,000) in 2001.
"We were faced with the situation: should we continue to run the club or close it?" one of the defendants told the tax inspector of the large-scale company in Brotberuf.
He and his colleague and co-defendant then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We put money down, put our life insurance in the bank as collateral", he said at the takeover.
The agreement with the association was that they could freely manage the money, but that no debts were to be incurred.
The Court also held that, in the event of financial success, the payment of the compensation for expenses was to be decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, part of the compensation for expenses was paid years later, namely from 2003, when there was a surplus on the account.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the European Union's financial contribution to the European Union.
The accounts and savings books were jointly managed by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the details of the payments had not been disclosed to the association.
The answer was that the association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, but only in the debt relief.
In 2011, when an investigation was launched against one of the officials for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
The defendants stated that these were deposits.
This security account was in the name of the second defendant and according to his statement the association was not aware of it.
"Why?" the judge asked.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he said he thought it was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor said.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official defended himself.
This transfer was worded as "reparation".
Why compensation? the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of the woods with this one".
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official further stated that he had never received a penny of salary, but had only calculated the mileage and the allowances.
He said he had billed the club for 1,000 euros a month in fees, but the actual cost was much higher.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be presented by the defendants.
They were no longer kept after an in-house inspection, which had found everything to be correct, they said.
The second defendant had also taken the fare.
All payments were made in cash, and he had to travel from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff cuts that have been underway for the past three years, the computer giant will cut more jobs as it splits up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not ending.
The US technology group plans to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division as part of its restructuring.
The company said on Tuesday that it would save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion) in costs.
The move will result in a surcharge of approximately $2.7 billion, which will be due from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been going on for three years, is not yet complete.
HP still employed approximately 302 000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
After-tax, Hewlett-Packard stock was down 2.3 percent.
The company, which grew up with printers in Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: the computer and printing business is to be consolidated even more closely in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second largest PC manufacturer in the world, after Lenovo, has recently been hit by another disappointing PC sales and a weakening demand for its services from corporate customers.
In the third quarter ending July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 per cent.
Sales dropped 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This means that revenues have declined in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the industry's change by splitting up and cutting jobs.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has been slow to respond to the shift from traditional computers to smartphones and tablets, and to the increasing number of online transactions.
Whitman's restructuring plans are to cut around 55,000 jobs in total.
Conflicts: majority support for anti-IS training mission
The direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly rejected: 54 percent were against, while 35 percent were in favour.
61 percent of respondents say that other countries are carrying out air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria.
Twenty-four percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is opposed by 51 percent of those polled, while 20 percent are in favor.
29% were undecided.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair, which runs until 27 September, will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility.
After two days of press conferences, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday, under the theme 'Mobility connects'.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA motor association expect around 900 000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
The European Union is committed to the principle of non-refoulement.
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border in Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line formed, and behind the policemen a water cannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing rocks, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers first applied pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
That's the end of the group.
The refugees have now retreated a little, waiting.
A pregnant woman, obviously injured, was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees became withdrawn and breathless.
The press spokesmen of the Serbian police were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world will be watching as the Federal Reserve meets for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought the Fed would do this last week now think it will stay a little longer, keeping interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero zone and start a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is doing relatively well, trillions of dollars are being added to the balance sheet, and it's generating little inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned markets to prepare for a hike, but the signs are that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Deadly shooter at Delta State University left a note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished "he could undo it", authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house, but that "nobody will bother" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shooting.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination".
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also having an affair with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triple relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who's 19 and she's "destroyed".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friend".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", said Knowles
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail".
When officers caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself dead.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left) pictured with his son Redmond (right) has had some stressful years.
In 2001, he was battling leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this must be taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group alone wants to save half a billion euros a year by improving its organisation.
150 of the world's 1,000 or so executives will lose their jobs as a result of the restructuring.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its business and upgrading its subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute to the earnings of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the new rules are applied.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
The executive team headed by Chief Executive Carsten Spohr will in future be headed by Karl Ulrich Garnadt.
The restructuring underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the group intends to use against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
The organization of the 120,000-strong enterprise was complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the case of the labour dispute with the Cockpit (VC) pilots' union, negotiations are to resume this Thursday after the strike was put on hold by the courts.
That's what the union said.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted to achieve viable results as soon as possible "within a year of a forecasted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In the background, along with the pilot transition, is the Wings savings concept.
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to its own Eurowings passenger line in order to combat competition.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out of action for months with a double fracture .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this has left the left-sided full-back crying and will keep him out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital".
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, it's very difficult and then he plays fantastically, and then this happens.
He was in the locker room wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the penalty of a penalty of one meter.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery is starting now, I will come back stronger".
In this context, Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The European Championship in France gives the England defender an extra incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury".
When a player leaves the field with that kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played Van Gaal's Holland team in the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good", Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel really bad about this.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than you?
It's one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I love to read to my children, because there always seems to be an image or message we've missed".
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron purportedly describes the plot of the book, instead re-captures a table of contents of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand upon the rather short original text.
"In the walled city of Thneedville, where all nature has gone and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", reads the caption.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads in part like the synopsis of the Lorax movie, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins: "In the walled city of Thneedville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, as an unnamed boy hears the local environment being ravaged by the greedy, tree-cutting, thneed-knit Once-ler despite the protests of the namesake Lorax, a squat, mustachioed creature "who speaks for the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low-level PR task was delegated to a helper who had not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from the England team, but it's still hard to
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out a home win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the side three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they will not have any scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even though he is an unknown size on test level, is an option for the attack.
In this news, Adam Lyth is dropping out of the England Test squad and has been replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven Tests, he's had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are outcome-oriented.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because -- and I said this earlier -- players are their own best choosers.
A long time ago, you would have extended Lyth's life, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he can get more runs for Yorkshire, hopefully, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform as well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man first.
The question of how much time a test batsman is given to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only charge that can be brought was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at his peak - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitter I value.
He's an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early in the season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He must at least have the same opportunities as those who came before him, but this of course depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen hitting next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quick bowls, came up, and I'm not opposed to it.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county of Worcestershire, but he's a number three for them, and there's not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before he was the opening batsman in 2001.
He made 300 runs in a row and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a backup spinner, and in my limited contact with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his stats -- average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a punt, but there aren't a lot of backup spinners who are raising their hands and the coaches have gone for youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England have made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master stroke.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he's gonna bring a wealth of experience, because he's played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball stage of the Tour and he brings energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I've always felt he was made for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can all benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what's been said before.
Collis's Durham teammate Ben Stokes is not being used for the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for one, have no problem with that.
Some people may disagree, but coaches and team leaders don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Decisions like this are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp could gain traction if the economy is in a slump by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, who are violently bickering over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A friend of a European diplomat recently said that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-made agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don't want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they don't like them either, if they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local figures, then come home and say they're winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend who wants an outward-looking UK inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before things look bad for her, as they did for the excessively long-serving Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking to be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine them going out of their way to help the selfie-Brit, whose energy should be better spent on preventing Scotland's departure from the UK - something they don't want, either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So it's possible that some of these ministers are even deliberately planning unhelpful remarks, very SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign, to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 by a two-to-one margin.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU-like banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his insanity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-avoiding thugs, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you're better off handing out bananas to distract it than becoming its lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more of a Blairite than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum whirlwind, because Blair had put the principle over the un-adopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's 1980s Murdoch strategy of boycott, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I'll put it in a friendly way - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-carbon bent and the wilder reaches of Tory's Little Englandism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, as the scout inside him struggled to not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more appealing.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow competitors and MPs after all reports at their hearing on Monday night.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn is trying to convey - remember, he even stirred me - news discipline remains important in the age of 24-hour TV and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe which allows him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins would agree with you.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disagreement.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in making concessions to the British when all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cutting of the Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the "principles report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and have pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers, writing in the BMJ, asked whether the claims "are based on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: 'A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.'
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products, and the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said he received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reportedly previously receiving from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco directorate.
The group's research "significantly acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes are a way for children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the BMJ's claims had been responded to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still need to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence is and what it is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die from smoking-related illness every year, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programmes likely to be seen by a smaller audience in highly contested time slots against the most popular shows of its rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals", Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programmes that others don't make or commission.
They're broadcasting The Voice in a first-rate time window because they want to reach the widest possible audience for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such show, EastEnders is another, admittedly both of them self-produced.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what public television should be like.
I don't think it would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo what former Sky chief Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programmes "should go to BBC4 where you can't quite gauge the audience, but they are doing their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees, 'Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody has seen.'"
You put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee, "I would urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think, that for £150 a year you get a lot of value here, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC's output was now officially classed as education - he said it was 1 per cent of their TV output and 0.1 per cent in radio - and that they should take the example of public service television in Australia and Canada and change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically engineered nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high in frequency for human hearing.
The impulses work by activating motor neuron cells that are genetically engineered to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new technique called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Flatworms usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then enter the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves open these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are attached, reports Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbeads and transmitted into the worms, where they activate the altered motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to optogenetics, a breakthrough tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technology.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unimpeded and thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices right on your doorstep!
The ads are damaging Britain's arms trade
The video of the Amnesty International anti-arms fair.
They're the most horrible killer drones!
The ankle-breaking shackles!
Scatter the bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to smuggle weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
The EU's arms trade fair is a major event in the EU's history.
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
"Important Notice: Will You Ride the DLR from September 15 to 18?" read the London Underground's typeface and the DLR line's trademark logo, which changes to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be riding the DLR... asking customers to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of input keys that are claimed to "access around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London does not find this poster-boy "vandalism" amusing.
One of the spoof ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator at Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and seeking to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms-trade posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the non-profit advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun fair promotion - due to a blank space in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of creating a more realistic, shady corporate advertisement, but "the infusion of bright colors and animation keeps it more adherent".
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair", said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a British government intervention and a guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside ExCeL, where exhibitors are spouting fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a US Army order for "the shoulder-fired AT4CS RS".
These include a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding reverberation effects inside the target".
Whatever this does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a dorm
Eleven years ago, I moved into a dorm room as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I had upset - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from mildly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you're from, when and where you took your sabbatical, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room".
Just breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like as opposed to the people you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Leave the people.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie nights, and communal gathering places, but they're also the places where people dress and get their underwear ready.
In this regard, do not think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts get a rough ride at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student housing units create a room-to-room roaming culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I've spent interacting with you".
Try to sense when a peer is exhausted from socializing - and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had this idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
You make friends by baking.
Now, since you're entering college at the height of the back-mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less weird than the 1950s greeting, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, that depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to pose asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, it's theft to steal chickens, but is it theft to take a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll say to serve themselves, even if they're cooking inside.
If someone steals your things, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my roommate, who added detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but being, in the truest sense of the word, one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning Drum & Bass down a little bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before letting her own music plaster, locking her door, and going on to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
Conversely, wouldn't it be deeply embarrassing to mistake a roommate for your future spouse, fall for her, break up with her, and then have to see her every day and perhaps witness her dragging all of your mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart has a way of doing its own thing - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense into your gut.
The exciting moment you notice someone left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between a bully and a bully is much more subtle than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it only takes a few moments to turn it into a boomerang.
Hiding teaches a valuable and fun lesson about safety - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, put your keys in a glass of water, and put it in the freezer - but don't pin your belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Serial housing for refugees, single parents, low-income households
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who don't have much money in the Eckental region of central France.
So for refugees, for example, but also as a signal: "It's not just refugees who need housing, but single mothers and low-income earners as well".
"I'm showing how to build cheaply and well today", says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will crowd into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to create affordable housing quickly: he is building a project of row houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, there's going to be a lot of refugees pouring into the housing market.
What solution do you propose?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gyms is not sustainable.
Because people are staying here for the most part.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will need sufficient housing for the coming decades.
A very commonplace three-storey row house is the solution.
A terraced house is the least space-consuming.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
Many refugees may say, "It's peace, I'm going back".
Then the houses can be easily adapted to the needs of the individual.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's understandable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building codes complicate your plans?
I've actually done my project correctly.
The threat of the sword of Damocles and the special construction and the parking regulations always make things more complicated.
It was creepy.
It is still assumed that if you are to create three apartments in a terraced house, you need at least three seats.
Only in the cities is there no room for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How have the residents reacted to your terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some, who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true: we've had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has a message that ordinary people need housing.
Not just refugees, but single mothers and low-income earners as well.
I'm showing how to build cheap and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tapping "General", and then selecting "Software Update".
When it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message saying that the "software update failed".
To work around the problem, users are advised to either wait for the onslaught to go back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update. It will also be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down midway and this could lead to the update being canceled.
iOS 9 release still on schedule despite WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9: the least exciting but best iOS 9 update so far: How to prepare for the new iPhone OS
You should also make sure that you've checked our checklist of all things before you download it, to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto is full-on attack.
Nico Rosberg's only motto in the fight for the Formula 1 world championship against his clear-headed Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton is "full attack".
The World Cup runner-up, before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, stressed "that I have nothing to lose".
53 points separating the reigning world champion from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton before the night race in Singapore this Sunday.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also the favorite to take on the Flutlicht Grand Prix in the city state.
In 2009, and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze has hung over the city, sparked by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chessfrienden Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is Paul Gauselmann, a keen chess and tennis player who has visited Bad Kissingen more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen was supported by Gauselmann with a donation, which was accepted by the chairman, Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to take in chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the future of the European Union.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum have teamed up under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to counselling, courses are also available.
The Social Welfare Foundation is moving down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, next to the shopping market, seniors and those seeking advice can now receive information on questions such as nursing care insurance or the services of the sickness and care insurance funds.
For years, our outpatient care service has found that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"It is not uncommon for many services to be missed because the complexity of insurance is still not understood", explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the Amadeus ambulance service.
In addition to counselling, the new district office also offers prevention, health and well-being courses.
The Saludis were taken on board for this purpose.
Therefore, additional services such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy may be used.
The services provided by the senior centre and the Saludis complement each other perfectly.
Saludis is an acronym for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre", explained Heike Riedel, the managing director of Saludis.
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city centre is seen by both managing directors as being particularly due to demographic change.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council for the future.
In addition, the district office is also dedicated to the loneliness of the elderly, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasised at the opening ceremony: 'There are numerous events and offers on the agenda, and these invite you to a regular social gathering'.
The Social Foundation has thus made a major contribution to ensuring that older people can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar surroundings.
The district office is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 to 14 hours, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 16 to 18 hours and on Saturdays from 10 to 12 hours.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on the 6th of October
Now it's official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-tier Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the date of October 6 has now been set.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth round of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third-tier club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively terminated.
The match will be played on Tuesday, October 6 at 7 p.m. at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game will be played, we now have planning certainty", says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket sales that have just started.
It's a special thing for our team to play against a third-tier team.
We therefore hope to see a large number of spectators, and not without reason, since flood games have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg 2010 entered the round of the last 16 teams by winning against the district league opponent FC 1. Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league opponent 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Vereinspokal 2016/2017.
The defending champion is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyen of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Former soccer player Tim Wiese has been unwelcome in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and involved with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
He claims to have gained 100 pounds [30 kg] of muscle mass in the past two years.
But he has not gained much in intellectual capacity.
Wiese was getting his hair cut in the city of Bremen when he saw a parking lot attendant outside, posting a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the employee, and threw the fine at her feet, reports the Bild newspaper.
The city of Bremen has confirmed the allegations, but has not yet determined the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review", says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to report Wiese.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rain forest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days, Panamanian authorities have been tearing down and burning 4,500 plants.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans in a
Police are looking for a witness to an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at around 11.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends about five meters away, according to police, and shouted at them to wait for him.
At this point, the group was at the bft filling station.
Three other persons were also present at the gas station.
One of the men shouted at the youth and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nasal bone and severe nosebleeds.
When his two friends rushed over to him and spoke soothingly, the man first let go of his victim.
His friends have now brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove past them several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went to the front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the bat and another male.
Using a club, the victim was beaten on the face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, we have only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second hitter was said to be about 5 feet 11 inches tall and wearing jeans and a brown-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and informants to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros in the new building
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (left) are taking over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The mayor of the Samt municipality, Bernd Bormann, the economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and the mayor of Asendorf, Heinfried Kabbert, are also happy about this.
In many places in the country there is a shortage of doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice in Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be assisting his successor with half a post in the coming months.
After a period of conversion, Müller reopened the practice on 12 October, by which time he had invested EUR 310000 in the premises at St. Marcellusstrasse 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausen family met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and intends to join the practice next year.
"We always thought that the Müllers would be a good fit for this practice", says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen, laughing.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The Müllers liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients is very attractive to us", says Müller, 39.
"We want to get to know the families over the years and accompany them".
He also sees the advantage of soon being his own boss.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The father of two children, Frank Müller, grew up there, and after studying medicine in Hanover, he worked in several doctor's offices and in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the head emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is involved in the DRK-Readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Starting September 19th, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, are planning to become house doctors.
"That's why the endoscopy comes out", says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations, long-term and stress-related ECGs and we will need more consulting rooms.
The EDP will also be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of EUR 50000 as part of a support programme from the district (EUR 25000), the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued", says Bernd Bormann, mayor of Samtgemeinde.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice each quarter, while the average number of patients in the northern German practice is about 500.
There's another general practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller: the pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If she hadn't found a successor, she would have left, too.
The seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens are still the ones who are most familiar to those who visit Müller's office.
Their departure marks the end of an era in Asendorf, where the medical profession had been established for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we had only two rooms", recalls Ursel Felstehausen with a grin.
She's feeling a little bit of melancholy after all this time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients again", says the internist.
Her husband adds with a smile: "We have a 6,000-square-foot property".
"I've always avoided gardening, but this time it might be different".
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy traveling.
Croatia: 'We are allowing the refugees to pass'
"Now border controls are being increased at our southern border as well", said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will continue in parallel.
The Commission is also proposing that the Council should be able to adopt a decision on the basis of the Commission's proposal.
The provision and safety of the people is paramount.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council for adoption.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It requires a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia refuses to take part
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and possibly establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the view of Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", he said, adding that Slovenia would rather intensify border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of the environment against the effects of ionising radiation.
The Minister stressed that Slovenia was not seeking to close its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work", Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to evade registration.
Croatian police were able to apprehend them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, since then, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
The majority of these are Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
The Commission has also been asked to take account of the situation in the country.
In the coming days, his country expects to receive about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border that had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border were being diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We neither can nor will do this", it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses are expected later in the day.
Across Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, some 300 miles [500 km] away, through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to come here", said one of the refugees.
They were to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria on to Germany.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more westerly route, as already predicted by observers.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive options for border control' is a key element of the EU's strategy to combat illegal immigration and the fight against terrorism.
Earlier, Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
The European Union is not a member of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007 and its EU partners have consistently given it a good record in terms of border control standards.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
Belgrade media reports that they spent the night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossing points, Horgos and Backi Breg, remain completely closed.
It is not yet clear whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down the situation at a local meeting in Horgos early on Wednesday, saying that the debate on alternative routes for refugees, now that the Hungarian border was closed, was premature.
The Commission is therefore in favour of a more flexible approach to the problem of the refugees.
It is not yet known whether they will continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to take dangerous alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee agencies have already started distributing maps to refugees, showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: parts of the border area still have minefields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance workers had been sent to the border region.
Ukrainians pay $30 million to hack the stock market
Supranonok is believed to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of stealing unreleased financial reports and press releases from websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is said to have been used to conduct insider deals on the financial markets.
In this way, investigators estimate that over $100 million was embezzled.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught", the SEC statement says.
Trials continued against 32 other defendants in the case.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have operated from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
The Ecumenical Hospice Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
The parade ground in Mannheim is bustling with activity.
People go about their chores, sometimes in a hurry, sometimes in a leisurely stroll.
You're heading to the two stations of the Mannheim Auto Show in the Parade Square.
Stop the city trains.
Pulsating, bragging life in the glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle four large boards each with the title "Before I die, I want"....
With this action, Ecumenical Hospice Aid has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary and is certainly facing mixed reactions.
"Life is important, so we have gone into the city and among the people", says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice is available for questions and discussions to the passengers as well as to the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously take up the chalk and add "I'm going to die", "I can read", "I'm going to drive across America", "Stop the war", or "I won't suffer long", others pause, read, say phrases like "I'm not there yet", and then continue.
There are always small discussions that develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, about dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that the world will end for me at some point can I live responsibly", says the director of the Mannheim Diaconical Work, which is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice together with the Caritas Association.
So this publicity campaign is good for the 20-year-old.
It is understandable that not everyone wants to make their views known on the panels, since this is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in particular has contributed a lot in recent years to people opening up.
A view shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The funeral director is one of the first-hour volunteers.
She read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was looking for volunteers by appeal, she immediately came forward and was present at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are assisting the affected and their relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospice Saint Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is very good at handling her task and the experiences and experiences she has had.
"I see life from a different perspective, I value it and I cherish the moment", she says.
The offer of the Ecumenical Outpatient Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of any religious denomination.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations make it possible to train, train and supervise the funeral and mourning attendants.
Training is offered for new employees every two years.
The paintings described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit outlook because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it will make a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than its previous forecast.
Analysts are expecting a survey from FactSet to bring in $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, averaging 4.9 percent, effective January 4, and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, levied from November.
The company said that it still expected its profit to increase from the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "reporting solid returns when we consider weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day after those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts Zacks interviewed were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to stagnation in its express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
Last quarter, ground transportation sales were up 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Over them, at one end of the ornate, two-story conference hall, is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all else.
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X factor in a decision too close to call, as it is revealed on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start weaning itself from the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Although most economic data shows that the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already cautious Fed officials worried about adding to this volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the main thing they're watching", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is justification enough to continue to wait", she said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself makes the financial markets uncertain.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets are expecting a wait-and-see from the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a hike.
This indicates a stock market decline if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at this point", he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to calm financial markets so they don't panic".
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has consistently been below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world rattled late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% from its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would dampen global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below its May high.
For Fed officials, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If it weren't for the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have pulled the reins in this session", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, and therefore it should not technically be involved in its decision-making.
But in effect the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that don't seem to be connected to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited detectable effects on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize aspects of financial stability during a major crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turbulence doesn't come close to this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to be in a situation where it's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting excited", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should be ahead of its time.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of entry and offers a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and utensils, furniture, religious ornaments and Christmas decorations.
There's even a car department if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to walk through the hallways.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The good and affordable kitchen in this store is near the cash register and has various take-away options.
What's in here, do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian delicacies and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
A good portion of the store is the massive freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods, and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklift trucks.
You can find it here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the register.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is busy, it's not hard to find a parking spot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
The warm welcome you are receiving is made possible by the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda too, there are a number of people who are selflessly supporting asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still loves to teach.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, that's a whole different lesson from a real school.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women into the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by showing pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets can affect the child's immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipality council of Bernried approved the building application for the sports hall, which cost 2.3 million euros.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flattened for solar.
The planning of the long-awaited gymnasium building at the Bernrieder sports ground is progressing step by step: the draft building proposal was approved unanimously without much discussion at the recent municipal council meeting.
The committee had previously decided on a request for a building code "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The 'exception' concerned the permission for a special form of roof construction.
The project is to construct a "saddle roof with non-central roof and roof overhang".
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar panels: "This will give us a wonderful large southern roof", Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The 'liberation' was again concerned with the roof slope, which for energy reasons - contrary to the construction plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This reduces the volume of the hall considerably.
An 'exemption' was necessary because the development plan does not allow for 'exceptions' in respect of roof pitch - although the Berneder Gemeinderat generally acts more restrictively in respect of exemption requests.
But the construction of the gymnasium is not a recurrent project: "We are not setting a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at some 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from the school and public sports promotion.
The next step in the procedure is to submit the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall to the county council office for examination.
Peißenberg clinic is moving to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) is appointed new medical director of Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
The district's hospital, which was confirmed by the regional councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß, has announced plans to do so.
The decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans are implemented, all the approximately 50 employees of the hospital in Peißenberg would be kept on the job.
The vast majority of the population is to move to Schongau with Fischer and the remaining inner station.
The rooms are available.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and now moves to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
The question of who should succeed came up, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer", who agreed to take over as of 1 October and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the Schongau-based company, this was in any case an "upgrade" and an expansion of the range of services in the field of internal medicine, said Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is the specialist gastroenterology unit in the Inner Ward.
Fischer and his team will run both houses on a transitional basis for the next two years, if the supervisory board agrees, until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed permanently in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
The district had previously planned to do so in 2018, when the ongoing refurbishment of the hospital in Weilheim will be completed.
The Commission has also proposed that the Court of Justice should be able to give its opinion on the question of the application of the principle of equal treatment to men and women in the field of employment.
"I'm not going to take it". As for the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
The hospital is currently home to a Caritas short-term care centre and a day-care psychiatric unit.
"We couldn't have had a better experience, such an opportunity will not come again", said Fischer of the quasi-migration to Lech, which was received by the staff "positively and with great understanding".
There was no real prospect for the house where Fischer had worked as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by colleagues in Schongau to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg hospital (at least 100 beds) has been threatened with closure repeatedly in recent decades, with departments being closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are called this evening (20.15 hours) at the Bergische HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Bader team suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have to make amends.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire while harvesting corn on Tuesday afternoon.
During the winter break in a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in action, as the police announced.
A 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man were seriously injured and taken to hospitals after a shooting.
How exactly the accident could have happened was unclear at first.
The Crime Squad is investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of violent crime
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old boy from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old confessed to killing the youths and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from the Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as the public prosecutor's office and the police announced on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man arrested on Tuesday night, who reportedly confessed to the crime and led investigators to the body.
The 16-year-old girl was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed the previous evening after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal belongings of the victim.
Interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing eventually revealed suspicion of the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested man confessed to the authorities during police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old girl and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to appear in court on Wednesday, with investigators charging him with manslaughter.
Further investigation will reveal the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need shelter: study warns of housing shortage
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The construction of social housing is a challenge.
The fight for distribution in the German housing market has long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are entering a market that is already overcrowded in many big cities.
They're competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the Confederation of Social Housing.
By comparison, 260,000 units will be produced in Germany this year.
That leaves 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer required to live in a first-aid accommodation as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many then find themselves in the housing market, lining up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers were renting their homes last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany faces a housing deficit that is growing every year.
The study's author, Matthias Günther, said that there were already about 770,000 housing units missing in the metropolitan areas.
Many workers were therefore forced to live in shared rooms in large cities.
Young adults were involuntarily staying longer at the Hotel Mama because of the housing market downturn.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per head had fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a new start.
The aim is to provide new incentives to boost social housing.
The tax on land acquisition could be abolished and the tax on subsidised housing suspended for a limited period.
The Alliance also argued that attractive tax depreciation options were needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A week after the launch, more than half of the available €300 million had been called up by Monday evening, at €184 million.
Now the project could even be extended.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is virtually no way through Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing to cross Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the passage of passengers through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
But the route is still dangerous.
The EU has already made a number of proposals to the Council on the future of the EU.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor", said the Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set off for Croatia, from where they will try to reach Western Europe.
The Croatian TV channel RTL reports that 500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik.
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make formal asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "They can travel through, and we are preparing for that possibility".
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at Serbia's border with EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
Most of the victims were reportedly from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they attempted to cross the Green Line into Croatia on foot.
The Croatian-Serbian border is not fenced in by refugees.
But the border region is fraught with other dangers: it still contains land mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
The Minesweepers are now to make a safe passage quickly.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'recycled' in the same way as the term 'recycled'.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before the doors closed on Monday, it was 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws make it a criminal offence to cross and damage the border fence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal cases were opened.
The convicted face up to five years in prison and deportation.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established "transit zones" at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - at the main crossing Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
By Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still believed to be there.
But practically no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a 'safe third country'.
Refused asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
Workers in Röszke started to clean it up.
They were collecting the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
The grids were removed and one of the storage rooms at the border was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this remodel.
Austria is receiving only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also increased its border controls.
The government estimates that there are still some 20,000 migrants in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting to be taken to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
Freilassing was regularly visited by smaller groups of refugees on foot.
Mayor drove the "Gestrand" across the border
"We were cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent", said Alois Stadler, mayor of Wernstein.
Tourists, they were taking the train to Passau.
But because Germany had suddenly suspended rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded men, along with two other helpers and their cars, across the border to near Passau.
Before, we'd entertained the unexpected guests with a little refreshment.
We said we'd take them to Passau by car.
"This was a matter of course for us", says Stadler in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
One man was so generous that he made a donation of $100 for the fire department.
"We were very pleased", says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had boarded a regional train to Passau from an ICE on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try to cross the border after the announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended.
The regional train was stopped at Wernstein am Inn, just before the border.
In Wernstein, cross-border crime is generally high in the ratings.
The bridge festival was held in a friendly atmosphere with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, and the day before a two-bridge race was held in a sporty way - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending another zillion to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures to guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has officially and publicly dragged the Hungarian government into the darkness of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees too will have to realize that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing influx of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for asylum seekers in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proofed quarters
Konrad is busy with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Conrad is used to his word carrying weight.
The government has hired the formerly powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the Traiskirchen reception center has already gotten Konrad under control.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen", he said of his first success.
The European Parliament has also called for the introduction of a new European Parliamentary Assembly procedure for the European Parliament.
The Home Office, on the other hand, called it a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet this figure, 35,000 more shelters will need to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can handle it.
"But it is not a bottomless barrel", said Konrad.
He's already been talking to the governors.
These would have assured him that they would also provide quarters for the incoming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria", said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar is backing Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to discuss how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also sets high expectations for the ORF action "Helping like us".
The platform allows private individuals to easily offer accommodation.
And you're hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "too high".
In times of emergency, it may not be that the quartermaster has to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or size of the top light.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to be applied.
Konrad's experience is what makes him more successful in housing than the Ministry of the Interior.
I'm an old man who doesn't take lying at face value.
He said persuasion was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier have declared that they do not cause any cost to the Republic.
They want to increase their staff to three or four.
The search for his own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seems to be a problem with the permit.
Linz calls for better distribution of resources
The city of Linz is not planning to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips-Arena and the Design Center to house refugees.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of people who are in need of housing, according to the mayor, Klaus Luger (SP).
However, other sites are to be checked for their suitability in the event of an emergency.
The head of the town criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute to this.
Seehofer: "The borders are not sealed"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the state's governor, Josef Pühringer (VP), agreed on Monday on the next steps in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The continuation of the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic was still possible.
But there are the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
The European Council welcomed the progress made in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, and called on the Commission to present a report on the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
The fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is, according to Pühringer, "a logical consequence" of the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time.
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial zone has been officially completed.
The four six-storey office and production building is occupied by the listed IT group S&T, the rest (2700 square metres) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smartest minds are our raw material - and we have to make them work for us", says S&T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Dock and later acquiring some of them.
From the outset, S&T has been keen to cooperate with its new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises himself: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested EUR 1.7 million in the site, EUR 3.3 million in the Techcenter, which is owned by one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal state (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
Thirty percent of the remaining 2700 square feet of space in the building is already rented, and there are inquiries for another 40 percent.
Lia-Peroni owner opened a second store in the arcade
The new shop is focused on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni's Pigeon Market Arcade had to postpone this project: after all, she has now received an extension in the form of another store.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes of various manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories can cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop opened yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks before.
"But I've been thinking about opening another shop for a long time", says Breit.
The decision was taken partly because the Furla producers, whose headquarters are in Bologna, were also interested in the idea of having their own site where only their handbags would be sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area that sell this brand", says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit's interest in fashion was nurtured by her mother.
I'm most suited to seeing things develop and to be able to show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women become enthralled at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman cannot answer with absolute certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag makes any outfit worthwhile.
The Rattler of Kallstadt
Donald Trump's Pfalz ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This trait is also associated with the billionaire who wants to be president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for a fuss.
Whether he is xenophobic, rude to journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics, the candidate for the US presidency is turning the election campaign upside down.
And cutting it off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire's grandparents are from.
The New Yorker with the hair like a hair dryer is a household name in the wine country.
Many in the town of 1200 inhabitants are related to him.
His grandfather was from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The cold city girl Simone Wendel made a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstad way", says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstädt has made an amusing documentary about the town and its famous descendants, including the Ketchup family Heinz, in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - thus stating that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't take it to the King of Hearts.
There was respect for the family's achievements, but also a tendency to think that Trump was "already a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname Kallstadt had in the area was "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the show-off.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his future grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a gold-digging shop.
The real estate company's first real estate acquisitions were in New York.
However, the lives of the grandparents were not without tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland permanently failed at the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He had not recorded Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared at the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes uncomfortable statements of the successor.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"It's not so sympathetic the way it is", says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was a born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American as a distant figure, "he's always so upset".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that", said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that", says the 68-year-old.
She felt it would be better if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in charge in his grandfather's day had been like him, "he would never have got there".
"There are more interesting subjects than him", says the winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president", she says.
And, "The grapes are ripening without President Trump".
Wendel's film, which Trump was interviewed for, has been seen by 12,000 moviegoers, and is gaining interest in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
The vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, awarded the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the prize.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings despite Nine's attempts to take the loss of the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership's loss, but it hasn't produced any major shifts in ratings for Today.
The Nine Breakfast Show was broadcast from the nation's capital as Malcolm Turnbull engineered the ouster of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change are affecting these morons more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit-show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a resounding "yes".
Seven's The X Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) slightly.
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half, from 5:30 to 6:00, jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia was watched by 520,000, and the second half-hour by a whopping 720,000.
Hot-seat averaged 620,000. That's what I'm going to do.
The decline in the second night's ratings of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute who failed to make the cut on the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
What is the secret?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they turn two, you may have inadvertently given a hint as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed tight until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically spoken out about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they would love to be his partner.
However, when asked the question "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?" their answers could be game-changers as to who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as the best partner for Wood, besides themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed [Sarah's] and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show", said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is down to earth, it's so much fun to be with her", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
From her perspective, Mackay said that the house call last week made it clear that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now totally committed to him", she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that", she said.
I love the other girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the U.S. -- and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have Hayne benched for the rest of the game when he lost a scrum, as the Aussie rugby league convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to make a punt return and also to the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colors in the locker room after the game.
Instead of putting his rookies through the paces in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sportswriter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his busted catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches a punt that was recovered in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field swearing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just worry about the next game, and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass at in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian roller coaster.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his democratic efforts were thwarted.
The Free Voters demand the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
The party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn recess in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavarian schools if there are not new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse", said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will have a shake-up in the Bavarian education system".
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian commune.
In fact, the main subjects were quite different.
But the record number of refugees is now dominating the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course the asylum issue will superimpose the cloister", Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee shelters in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way it goes, we have to look at the causes", said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
This is why Aiwanger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges", said Aiwanger.
The FW head criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards for the federal states".
"Bavaria is pushing, others are not".
"We must become more active".
But the regional policy in the Greater Wallonia should not be undermined.
A longstanding issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
The new school year saw the launch of a pilot project by the Minister of Culture, Ludwig Spaenle (CSU), in 47 secondary schools, to test the extension of the secondary school education from three to four years - in the end it takes nine years to reach the final year of high school.
But that is not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated", said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever it is desired.
Wall Street firms are helping Dax get back on his feet .
The German stock market has closed with gains after a long period of directionless and nervous trading.
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger start in the US stock market provided a clear direction, which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.56 per cent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax of medium-sized stocks gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The tech-heavy TecDax was up 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 index, which is the leading index for the euro area, rose by 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points.
The London and Paris markets also recorded solid profits.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index recently gained about 1 percent.
Many stock market participants expect the markets to be in a tailspin until after the US interest rate decision and the big drop in the futures markets on Friday.
The debate on the burden of nuclear decommissioning has meanwhile pushed RWE's shares to a record low and left a deep mark on Eon.
According to "Spiegel", German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures reported in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares rose another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one trader, a positive report in the US investment magazine "Barron's" from the weekend had an impact.
The German chipmaker was not currently receiving sufficient attention from investors.
The investment in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen's shares increased by 1.26%.
The yield on German bond market in the form of exchange-traded German bonds fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) per cent.

The Federal Future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro's price dropped to $1.1262 in the afternoon.
At noon the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at US$ 1,1305 (1,1268).
The dollar was thus worth 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence erupted Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's senior official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some throwing rocks and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police fired tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, appeared to produce such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Tharu who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 December.
The first was the August massacre, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Planned construction area in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the sale of the 4,000-square-foot space.
A mix of commercial, industrial and residential is planned, but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden is planning to sell a 4,000 square metre plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are under way.
The site is planned to be used for a mix of commercial, industrial and residential use.
The city is waiting for offers.
The Commission has not yet decided which investor should be considered.
Accordingly, no contracts had been concluded yet.
The City of Emden had already bought a part of the land at the Ringstraße/Große Straße corner some months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
Plans for a holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project to the public for the first time.
Many residents are still worried about the sale of their holiday home.
It had been negotiated, pondered, debated and sketched for months behind closed doors.
Plans are now being drawn up for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time in public on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP faction, who accused the investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends from the system-building management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions", he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to counter all the rumors now.
The project, which will cost between 10 and 12 million euros, has been discussed for months.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel building provoked strong reactions from seaside lodging owners who had attended the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of a seafood stand and a board member of the local residents' association Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a giant building that will outshine all the other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly because of the planned size of the plant: 'There must be whole busloads to make this count', says Schulz.
What exactly is happening on the acre-and-a-half of former inn, however, is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must first have a coherent concept", said Ralf Behrends.
The Commission's proposal for a directive was to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
Twins born to gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted to have newborns among its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twins are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago, and it was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not been determined yet, as Mother Diana is still holding them tightly.
The first was the "Bild" newspaper.
NHC is predicting a 60 percent chance of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The US National Hurricane Center on Tuesday forecast a broad-based low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc announced a "double-down" campaign that will raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an unusually personal approach to announcing the fundraiser on its blog.
Rather than let a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her own experiences.
"Our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold, and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people, like my family, are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For diabetics who are slightly overweight, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes will live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show anything", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight-loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery, or obesity surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they had collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tubal ligation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, those who received nonsurgical diabetes treatments had a BMI of about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had their diabetes completely resolved and 28% had it partially resolved.
In comparison, only 1 percent of the medically treated group had diabetes completely resolved, and only about 2 percent had it partially resolved.
In addition, the results of the blood pressure, triglyceride, and "bad" LDL-cholesterol controls "were generally better in the 'surgery' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The best hemoglobin A1c is kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes for the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had more weight loss (18.7 vs 14.2 kg) than the gastrectomy group, achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and were more likely to have a complete diabetes recovery (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent surgery for obesity were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for those with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group", without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse".
Love story is in the back of the head
It is a theme that is currently gaining more attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unattractive in school days, meets after years the lover of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recent novel "We are not really like that" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it takes place in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The writer grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to create a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
The Dalai Lama said that Europe could not take in all refugees, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies.
He demanded that under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before those of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although praising the efforts of Germany and Austria in managing the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the violent response of the US was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has produced unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in hand sanitizer use by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of hand sanitizer-related incidents reported by poison control centers among children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more and more into these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some kids drink disinfectant on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a social media prank.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectants just for the sake of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouthwash to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive fragrances of the disinfectant.
"A child doesn't think that this is bad for it", said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive hand sanitizers are those that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, even a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children do, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently ingested four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice the legal limit for drunkenness in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use nonalcoholic products or disinfectants and to keep hand sanitizers out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than the active ingredient ethyl alcohol.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by spreading antibacterial products around the classroom", reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and has banned her from her room.
The police considered the failed plan "nonsense" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old motorist was slightly injured in a head-on collision on the cross-country road between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the intersection in the direction of the roundabout industrial area and too late noticed that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
He then crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed the vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta parked in front of it.
The police said that the vehicles involved in the accident suffered damage of about EUR 10 000.
The 33-year-old's Audi was not ready to be driven and had to be towed.
Rumors are flying: no disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad spot, but that he will turn it around.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson's indictment and Warburton will be cautious about January re-engagements that could destroy the squad's unity.
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths downplaying talk of disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which were spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team-mates are not under increased scrutiny as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're feeling any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show the highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic have to fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, who now have a clear five-point lead at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad times before, and we'll be back".
Now we want to get out of here as fast as we can.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton, be careful with January transfers.
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new signings, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
The players that come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, who was in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been battling a sore ankle for two years and has failed to make the Wales trip this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle because of Neilson comments suspended
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later lifted - the third red card for Collum to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, and insists, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance".
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment", said the striker, adding: "It's safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless it's playing for Celtic Glasgow".
Tannadice supervisory board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna get these guys back on track", said Donnelly.
McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unseemly".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive league win, which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's no team that's won everything, in cups or leagues, that's not won games like that".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the period May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of people employed now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, David Mundell, Scotland's Secretary of State, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy".
It's been almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the flow
When security personnel were unable to calm the situation, the staff called the police.
Only the use of pepper spray enabled the officers to take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test in a 16-year-old gave a reading of 0.89 per millimeter.
The growing one was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had a 2.15 per mille and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, barring any late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first extended in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who gets selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossop's closest friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the course of months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to bring a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll have access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have said it better", but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't write it if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go into all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory to the crime.
But I think there's a strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to warrant a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you're gonna get from me is what it's like to see a man die a needless death.
Man after wet police chase persuaded to come out of Canning River
The Canning Vale cop stayed dry when he talked the Canning River man down.
An attempt by a Perth man to avoid the police failed when he found himself in the shallow, swampy water, just a few feet from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore".
Canning Vale Police were called to a home invasion incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he was trying to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape", said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship soccer player Ben Cousins provides an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid an alcohol test and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that the stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were running a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself in difficult circumstances when it came to the positive cobalt-tuberculosis test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months from the espionage charge, and he didn't want it to "look like a hanging grape".
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once", said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had blown the whistle in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll name him if asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should be grabbing their noses because they failed to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's getting personal?
Is the RVL acting like a coward and maybe making people outside of coaches responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
They may have to take my license and kick me out, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make you think about it now.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led to him saying that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this", he said.
"One of my coworkers accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which it was.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race.
It's a joke. I know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all see the need for rules, but this has gone too far", said Moody.
Man arrested after hit-and-run
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a hit-and-run with a cyclist in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to the police in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with reckless driving, negligent driving, and other traffic offenses.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is fighting back against rivals over allegations of wrestling .
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackling "agenda-setting" by two of the NRL's Premier League favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed Storm players to "wrestle" with his team during the high-profile Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled remark to the Storm team after his team's win over the North Queensland Cowboys in the final on Saturday night, calling the game a "glamorous example" of rugby league and saying the two Queenslanders were not "too good" at wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling, saying that they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team made him feel confident, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24 to 2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, but in the last six weeks, we've made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that's been the game changer for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this keeps popping up this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take care of shit.
But now he has a team that can play and we find it exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have those kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football -- not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
I'm building up a stronger trust because they're saying these things because they're a little bit worried about having to play against us.
I guess they didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was all about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against the Roosters scored a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good one, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or is taking breaks and not scoring anything exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet them at some stage.
The Storm team is off this weekend, having won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the AAMI Park Preliminary on Saturday night, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man with $ 200,000 bail after drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for his attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilos of the drug on the Solay yacht, which had come from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess the entire quantity and that he might have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape danger in Maksimovic.
He has clear ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his whereabouts during the criminal case.
Maksimov's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bond as collateral to secure his release.
"It is clear from the sworn statements of the two persons that the imposition of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to deter him from not showing up, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: cabin breaks apart
A three-car accident on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening seriously injured a truck driver.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to make a left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's cabin was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 am.
The damage was estimated at 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure paedophiles into sending him pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as it was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up to discover the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the computer searches were conducted by him, but said it was done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was mentally ill when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Mr. Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, breaching the terms of the order on January 25 this year, and failing to appear for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be entered on the sex offender registry, arguing that there was "no significant sexual element" in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed sentencing until October to get background reports on community service.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in pretrial detention pending hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the sex offender registry before the date of sentencing.
Smugglers are using small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken in outside the main checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, fearing detection and arrest, let people pass through smaller border crossings
"We are not going to let the Austrian side get out", said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn River in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had crossed bridges and dams on foot to the German side.
There they are taken in by federal police officers and forwarded to the registry.
The main train station in Munich received significantly more refugees on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week, according to the Federal Police.
By 8 a.m. alone, some 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropical Storm Henry is expected to move southwest
Forecasters are warning of a storm surge in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
The German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported that warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a low pressure area over Western Europe.
The strong depression was the outlet of tropical storm Henry, which had crossed the Atlantic from Bermuda in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected in Baden.
According to the DWD, winds of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Bodensee circle until Thursday morning.
So, on Friday, the sun will be out for a while longer.
The crowd is the key: every two years, car manufacturers show their new cars at the IAA.
In 2015, the trend is mainly towards compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
The compact car segment is currently in particular demand: according to the Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA), this segment accounted for some 28.1% of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public day 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury and premium cars, this year will see the introduction of many new compact models.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us", said Opel's chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
He's part of the core of the brand.
The new Astra should not cost much more to make the volume model sell well.
Opel is looking to enter the market below its biggest competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine producing 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen is offering further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including for the first time also three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike its main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon, which is also already on display at the IAA.
And what's going to be on the new compact cars at the IAA besides the Astra?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra-rival Mégane to the race.
At the show, the Mégane will be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
It's coming to market early next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The newest addition to the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan subsidiary wants to find its place in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits in perfectly with the brand's design.
The base model will be fitted with a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: Another new addition to the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which is making its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer.
The Baleno will go on sale in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
The designers of the Citroën Ablegro took particular care of the front of the car, redesigning the grille and adding LED technology to the headlights.
The interior was modernized, with a touch screen that reduces the number of buttons and for the first time integrates Apple's CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added to the compact class at the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cells are unworthy of people
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favour of a former prisoner of the Tegel prison, who was held for months in a cell that was too small for him.
In principle, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation for the violation of their human dignity if they are confined in cells that are too small.
This was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can hope for money even if they have been confined in the cramped rooms for only a few days.
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters; the toilet was not separated in space.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now free, was moved to a larger cell.
His civil liability suit against the state of Berlin for the undignified conditions of his detention was unsuccessful.
However, the Constitutional Court annulled the judgment of the Kammergericht Berlin and referred the case back to it for reconsideration.
You see the man's dignity being violated.
The Court of First Instance is now deciding the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were relevant for the compensation, a right to compensation was claimed.
Otherwise, "the protection of personal data would be in danger of being lost".
The court of appeal must now decide on the amount of the financial compensation.
The Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, for example, a prisoner was awarded damages for being naked in a cell.
A 2011 decision also found that the use of multiple cell occupancy without a separate toilet is considered to be inhumane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 a dehumanizing accommodation.
The then applicant was held for between 15 and 21 hours a day for over three months in a cell similar to that of the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours, aggression is on the rise, and there have even been reports of violent clashes because of the tense situation.
According to information from the Judicial Press Office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young people, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We can do it'
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's coming for Germany?
The German government has already announced that it will be taking steps to ensure that the EU's citizens are able to access the EU's asylum system.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in the face of this unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we will do this".
The following overview gives an idea of what is in store for Germany.
According to various forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) homes are needed annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice the amount of housing built so far (250 000 dwellings).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housing units are falling out of rent control every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap housing units.
The German Federal Minister for Construction, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore wants to double the amount of funding, from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
The Pestel Institute considers this to be too little: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in supporting this.
The scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research estimates that in the long term 55 per cent of refugees in Germany will be able to find employment.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
The integration of refugees is however determined by whether they find work in Germany.
"Work is the key to social contacts, to the value of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants", says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, Thränhardt says, there has been a political change: from a ban on refugee work to the recognition of work.
While there was a previous ban on asylum seekers working for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residency requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market has been largely accepted in society, also because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
The number of courses offered is still insufficient for general and vocational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often found through personal contacts.
The development of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the key to integration into work.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in kindergarten, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of the daycare centre, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
If the need for female teachers were to increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example, by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, pupils without German skills are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Board.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state in Germany prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated students from studying - the only exception was Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
The accessibility of higher education could be made easier for refugees who are willing to study.
The reason for this is that refugees with a residence permit or a tolerated status no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Benefits Act when they start a course of study.
The latter do not in principle receive a pension, since they are not included in the circle of persons entitled to a pension.
As of 1 January 2016, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, but this period has been reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get their ba-fucks right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is a more important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches and develop the existing state-church relationship into a new state-religion relationship.
It is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association to take care of the newcomers in a professional manner.
Rights include duties.
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear points of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and to allow it certain control possibilities.
This includes a willingness to take a bold stand against religious fundamentalism.
The head of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could be brought into Germany as well.
Those who wanted to bring such conflicts to Germany "have their right to stay in Germany immediately revoked", he said on Bayerische Rundfunk.
The European Parliament has proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will be a much more general issue for society as a whole in the future than it is today.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the European Social Fund.
The German Government has, as a result of European decisions, for almost a decade now, had an anti-discrimination office and a general law on equal opportunities.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white interest groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention commit Germany to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
The German government is prepared to provide medical care for the refugees it has been expecting, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do it", he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, this would require additional money to be put into the system.
To avoid congestion, Montgomery is requiring all new arrivals to hand out health cards at check-in.
The benefits provided could be repaid to the Länder at a later date.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment is based on the principle of the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
Otherwise, the main thing that makes doctors create is the language barrier.
Thea Borde, a health scientist from Berlin, has already shown that migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a system of 'transfer of funds' to the European Union.
The European Union has also made a number of proposals to the Council and the European Parliament.
And with a different diagnostic eye.
For example, there is a significant increase in untreated disabilities among refugee children, and among young people, there is a need for HIV education.
The slightly different disease patterns were clear to German doctors from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasitic infestations and tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as for the shortage of medical supplies, he said that the refugees may even be able to provide relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed educational system, and some of the refugees are even doctors.
In order to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass further examinations.
The German Psychological Association (BPtK) estimates that at least half of the refugees who arrive in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by the University of Technology Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany traumatised.
Those who suffer from PTSD suffer from flashbacks, which include shortness of breath, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, intense fright, and emotional numbness.
Early treatment is necessary to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, Munz explained.
However, only four percent of refugees with mental illness receive psychotherapy.
Although asylum seekers with mental illness can apply for psychotherapy at social services, the process usually takes several months.
In addition, in social welfare offices, it is usually the case that social workers or doctors who are not trained in mental illness decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", Circus Probst is taking its cues from the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate all ages with fascinating acrobatics, animal acts, and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream on the brick-washed manege.
"Our passion is the circus".
"I can't imagine living without my circus family", says Stephanie Probst, a veterinary teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - that's the motto of the current stage production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm runs in the family.
"It's important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours", says the 27-year-old junior manager.
"Cocktail of monkeys with the flair of a global city", Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 2,000-mile journey can now experience this flair.
The circus' program features talented performers from around the world.
Winner of the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers know their stuff, too.
The Cuban duo are looking to take on the heroes of silent movies.
Lightness and mobility - these are the words they identify with.
Her humorous art on the mast is to capture women's hearts by storm.
Besides numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with finger-pointing and articulation.
Balancing the unicycle on a ball?
He Yuan is fine.
Snake people are both fascinating and terrifying.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is fascinated by its mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals are part of our family", says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconduct in the care of circus animals is all too often a topic of discussion among various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not well, we are not well".
Some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caress.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read every desire from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it won't go to the stable.
So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a hybrid of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals have lived together in a pen for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, all of a sudden, our little jumbo was there", says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid may not be ready for the ring, but it is the one and only mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for everyone who visits.
"One thing is certain", says Stephanie Probst, "whether it's five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and we give our heart".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September, daily at 5 and 8 p.m.
Sunday's program will begin at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, so for the 5:00 performance, prices are discounted.
The zoo is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the incident quickly spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations from opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and had been warned against shouting at Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but it is titled 'death'", he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that the immunity in Parliament ends and that once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a stand-alone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual sales of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing unprecedented integrated technology solutions for enterprises", according to a company statement.
It is the end of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been called the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in a series of actions based on the belief that more focused companies perform better.
Arsenal FC captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation was going as planned, there was no reason why he couldn't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a threat to his career", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or any of the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The Premier Injuries Ltd investigation has documented 23 different cases of Wilshere's disease since his debut six years ago.
He's also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to have recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rates will continue into the final season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he will, and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will begin their Champions League campaign against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is set to rotate within the squad.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are allowed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it", said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten in 41 games after starting the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale on Tuesday evening.
This year was the tenth in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope that his management will lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense", said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in the business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, especially in light of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of the Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the key to overcoming this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that having a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods" doubled the chances of recovery.
For those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first, for a friendship to work.
In an age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even when in reality, isolation is the norm.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values -- money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner longing for personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video-game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross' yearning for Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can relate to it anyway, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone worker explained to me: "My role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference".
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak to friends.
The old phrase 'I can get by with it' has a huge impact, like the feeling that it's perceived as weakness to talk openly about problems".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So, if you're coming to Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is airing on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria is meeting to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his win against Malmö.
Di Maria makes his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria was less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as PSG player who put the French champions on their way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a 61st-minute header.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not only to qualify for the knockout rounds, but to improve on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal, who was later substituted in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and to look back with a relaxed attitude, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect during the season", said Blanc.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not score another goal or two".
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was touted as the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was snapped up by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmö's defence before finishing past Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.
But if anyone thought PSG would win a big one, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, entered Anpiff with nine national players on the pitch and were a tough opponent with a five-man defence and two lined up deep in midfield.
But aside from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, which went a long way past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the way of offense.
Instead, PSG themselves sometimes gave up, with some misses and bad finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who paced alone in the first half on no less than five tries and then was dropped after Cavani had him re-signed after the restart.
However, he showed much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a spin shot that was passed by Wiland on the post in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark, thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended any speculation that Malmo could return to the game, and only an outstanding intervention from Wiland at short range to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough".
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is being hit by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion in a stock sale on Wednesday as part of its massive debt repayment plan.
Glencore, a London-based company, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early trading on Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay down about a third of its $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, which was a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99% of the group were sold.
Concerns about long-term stunting in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people arrived at the municipal administration in Weimar after a long flight.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
Xi's visit, Xi's first official visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and follows President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement", the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440-hp sports car borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rain-soaked highway, the evil awakening came.
A company in the district of Gotha offers the opportunity to fulfill your dream and to borrow and drive a V8 American sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
A 29-year-old from the district of Gotha did the same.
On the A71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of his sports car, skidded down the wet track and slammed into the dashboard.
The sports car was totally damaged, no one was hurt.
The material damage is estimated at EUR 40 000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi plays for the al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern were apparently close to signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight Spanish champions, three Cup winners, four Champions League winners, two Club World Champions, two European Champions, one World Champion - Xavi's record is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi revealed that he was already in the process of saying goodbye to Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship.
"They told me Barça wanted to sell me".
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing", he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria".
"Rumbley wanted me".
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't make the switch.
But the change did not come.
And the man who made it happen is working for the German record holder, Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great World Cup".
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me".
"That's how he got me".
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season with Xavi would have gone.
Xavi represented Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, eliminated the Reds (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the end of the first class triumph.
Matt Damon downplaying diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, veteran actor Brown interrupted the show when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives, with a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we're going to talk about diversity, you're going to do it in the cast of the movie, not in the cast of the show", Damon assured.
Brown reacted with shock, offended disbelief, and shouted "hoo! wow. okay", as the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about - whoever the director is going to be - how they treat the character of Harmony", Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a whore getting beat up by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People pitched finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon countered that their directing "may end up giving us something we don't want".
After the debate aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WELL that it hurts".
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when the accurate portrayal of race in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national attention, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group", the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are being invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowned first champion
Professional sport climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which was just wrapping up its seventh season, had never seen a competitor complete all of the stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finale.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the challenge in the time it took him to be the first athlete to complete the grueling Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-won victory, still reeling from winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never made more than $10,000 or had a life", Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
So suddenly... like I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first to finish the race, will not receive any prize money.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it", Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he gets the great reward.
I don't think he holds any grudge against it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's won a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I'm gonna get hit by anyone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they'd switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past the Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season hasn't been a very fun one for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, but today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played that part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins squandered a chance to advance within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return to the three-letter F-word that had been so elusive for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth, and then once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strong this year", said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go into the game with a lot of focus.
Tiger designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the baton well", said Ausmus.
He looked good in batting practice, looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs down in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a home run, and Simon struck out his second baseman Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy outplayed Mauer, the only man he faced, before designated rookie Miguel Sano, who gave right-hander Drew Verhagen a two-run home run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, the pleasure brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play leading the major leagues.
After Detroit added an insurance run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Mauer made an RBI double against the Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon and tied the game 5-4.
The right-hander, however, knocked Sano off three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit had the advantage of a still-unmoved Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been taken off the injured list before the game after missing more than a month with a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but I felt better when I got going and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches in the third inning".
After receiving the Leadoff batter in the first, the Hushes gave a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who scored a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez completed his 0-21 winning streak with the runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single off the right side, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to reach third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no runs in the third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and one walk with four strikeouts.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been sidelined with a shoulder injury.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the disabled list since mid-August with a dislocated shoulder, is set to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be taken off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in a trade with LHP David Price on July 30.
He's been missing since August 20th with a torn ACL in his right hip.
The Tigers and the Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is going to play against Minnesota 's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be housed in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for Wednesday night.
The people stranded there will be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, the city of Wiesbaden said on Tuesday evening.
She estimated between 450 and 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls in the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the Gießen Government Office responsible for initial admissions, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action with German participation in Syria is a possibility.
"I believe that decisive thinking about military options for action must not take place without Germany", he said.
He accused the European states of "collective dismissal".
Four years ago, we were glad that the chalice of military involvement had passed to Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep", he said on Germany's Deutsche Welle.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees on the ground.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced checks at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian television channel ORF on Tuesday evening that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
"No, that's the deal", she explained.
The European Union has also been active in the fight against terrorism, and has also been involved in the fight against terrorism.
The Commission has not yet given any figures, but it has referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
EU countries have so far been unable to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's interior ministers are to make a fresh push for the final distribution of a further 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday.
The Federal Government is keen to provide the Länder with more support in the first reception and distribution of refugees in Germany, given the high demand for refugees.
The German government will manage this jointly with the states, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
The EU's position on the EU's nuclear programme was also welcomed.
But those who have no prospect of staying in Germany cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort of power".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 110-mile (175 km) border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is not part of the EU like Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent traffickers from seeking alternative routes via Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were initial arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, thousands more migrants are reported to have made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which is located about a mile from Earth
Beneath the icy surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is emerging.
This is what researchers conclude from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
According to this, the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
This tail motion is small, but it is still too large for a continuous solid celestial body, says a statement Tuesday from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal Icarus.
It has been known for some time that liquid water must exist beneath the ice cap of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, spewing water vapor and ice particles that feed Saturn's E-ring.
At least at the South Pole, astronomers concluded at the time, there must be an underground sea.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich will have to forego offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier in the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis "presumably means four weeks of mandatory rest".
"This is a heavy loss for us, Rama".
"Of course we have to think about it now", sports director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper about the possible commitment of an un-associated professional.
As a guest of training, however, the Sixty first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously contracted by VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian now has "the opportunity to prove his worth".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to training next week after suffering a concussion.
The Austrian national player is due to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in a violent collision in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
Contrary to initial fears, however, he was left without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - Mangoes are high in sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to maintain their slim figure are often discouraged from doing so.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - mainly sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy, however, because they contain B vitamins, as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit thus supports vision, the immune system and the body's metabolic processes.
When purchased, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and should smell pleasant.
The color of the shell alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can be very tasty too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
But a mango also adds a special touch to hearty dishes.
It soothes the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads, such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US courier service UPS is once again hiring up to 95,000 extra workers for its Christmas sales in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
The main thing is to find drivers.
Last year, UPS added 95,000 holiday workers to its workforce.
With online business booming, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early preparations for the Christmas shopping season since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries were a source of criticism for parcel services.
First a hailstorm, then a marked cold front
The Föhn will break through the valleys of the north side of the Alps next night, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday nights, the Föhn blows partly with storm force through the Föhntäler valley.
After a windstorm on Thursday morning, a cold front crosses the country, bringing heavy rain, wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews reports in a news release, Switzerland is currently at the front of a large area of low pressure over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
The wind then blows in the Föhntäler valleys until Thursday morning with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, sporadically and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes with more than 100 km/h.
The winds can reach the adjacent central highlands, and in the mountains hurricane winds of over 75 miles per hour are possible.
While stormy weather in the north on Wednesday brings summer temperatures of 75 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the humidity on the Alpine slopes is beginning to settle.
Here, it starts raining and it lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps, more than 100 litres of rain per square metre are expected in the next 48 hours, after heavy rainfall in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the air runs out of the funnel, and then a cold front rolls over Switzerland from west to east, with heavy, partly torrential rain.
Along with the cold front, the wind is strong and refreshing, and the temperatures are dropping significantly.
The following days are autumn in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it is sunnier and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Less than 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of the mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was named after the German reformer.
In the Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is right in the middle of ancient Rome, right next to the Colosseum.
The name change had been requested by the Working Group of Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that for centuries Protestants in the city of the popes, as a minority, often had to live their faith in secret.
The square is a symbolic way of showing that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city was a corrupt Babylon of sin.
Historians believe that these negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther's theses against indulgences had led to a split in the Western church.
Hammer Künstler spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) Crown of Thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated the Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, now published with beautiful illustrations.
The original painting was for Otmar Alt, who created his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has retained his "language" of colorful colors and imaginative shapes - but that is not the same as "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, when adjusted to the subject matter, it can be quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of all Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on subjects such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments, or the Lord's Prayer.
This has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is the author, Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of the painting.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today's context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the given situation.
The jewelry wrapper has gold lettering.
So the 75-year-old allows a double double deep look into his soul, his emotions.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were the catalyst for the Bible project in the end: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"There was a time when education was done by the cane", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've been trying to work it out, to maybe get back together with the Lord Father".
He also said that he was concerned about helping art to regain its importance in the fast-moving times: "The perception of visual worlds is now shaped by advertising, and it is noisy.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different taste and pleasure in showing things.
Pictures are always mysterious and not decorative.
"In that respect, I'm a dinosaur".
Altmar wants the viewer to "fall" into the images, let them affect themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost, who was presenting the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation on Tuesday, said that he had "always been" a fan of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not try to cover the Bible in its entirety, but chose the topics that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level", says Altepost: "It's about the pictures, the text is just an explanation".
Hans Möhler, of the publishing company Luther, calls this work an invitation "to deepen one's life and find freedom".
For Möhler, the images of Otmar Alt speak both the (Biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening at the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Construction of BMX track is nearing
Plans were made, a site was found, companies were commissioned, earthen mounds were modelled for a round course: a year later almost everything was ready - but it was over before the official opening of the BMX track.
Political and administrative failures caused frustration, especially among the local residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill was moved, new site searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will come in October, the First Municipal Council Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now inform the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year will be more visible", she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool was to start without "further pause".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, with the Bundesliga making a clear statement this weekend.
Football is reacting to the worsening situation in Germany and is assuring the politicians of its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this the greatest challenge to our country since reunification".
"Nobody can say, 'This is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.'
"Everyone must be interested in getting a handle on this issue", said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
The European Union is also calling for the establishment of a European Union-wide network of contacts with the countries of the region.
"I'll be at the Chancellery next Wednesday and will meet Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor there".
"The issue will certainly play a central role", he announced.
Football can and will help.
The decisive course must be set by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019", Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's, Malta.
Some Federal League members also support this programme.
This weekend, the 36 professional clubs will make a clear statement by wearing the slogan "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve of their jerseys instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can", Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi Völler told the Bild newspaper on Tuesday, calling the project a "self-evident" one.
"The refugee drama is a matter for everyone, and no one should look the other way".
"We football Bundesligists can, no, we must use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly", said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director, Peter Rettig, spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensed clubs in their towns have started their own projects is great.
It's also great that small and small clubs are active.
The message we have issued, "One-O for a welcome", is being lived out in football.
"This is of enormous importance", he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB-Auswahl and the Federal Government, will each provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire amount for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
The accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States after midnight, he fell on a glass of water, which he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He nearly bled to death, fainted, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week", SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner quoted in "WiWo".
McDermott can do his job.
"We will meet at the beginning of October before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf", said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully fit for work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm all for SAP, all in my job".
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, all the time", said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf since the summer.
He said that it was important to him to go public with such a personal story, saying that "anyone can do it".
"It's important to get back up again after you've fallen".
McLaren 's backup pilot Magnussen has been out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo of the incident and said he was injured when he fell off his bike.
He is therefore not in the race in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
Borussia Dortmund have finally crushed all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League.
The German national will also miss the Bundesliga leader in the match against FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 CET).
"We cannot rely on him", said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top-flight against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
With the high workload on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his lineup at the Giant position.
He announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of Roman Bürki.
"He is training at the absolute top level", praised the football teacher of the world champion.
The club's goalkeeper, David Tuchel, said that the club would not be able to play in the Europa League.
There's a good chance he'll play the second game.
The sophisticated statement by fellow player Reus that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl considers understandable: "Marco is not so wrong about that".
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title".
Robots: government wants to pioneer for Germany
The German government wants to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which among other things provides for investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive.
Automated and connected driving will improve road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his G7 counterparts, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband deployment and a swift switch to digital audio.
A test track is being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver "does not incur additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to new developments".
The Commission has already proposed that the maximum speed for self-driving cars be raised from 10 to 130 km/h.
The German Government is also pushing for a change in the Vienna Convention, which so far only envisages human drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, the driver becoming more and more the passenger.
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "far beyond 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site is estimated by the authors of the study at around EUR 8.4 billion for 2025.
"Digital connectivity of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic", said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
However, the Germans are still skeptical about self-driving cars - much more so than the French or the Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization DEKRA, presented at the AA on Wednesday, shows that only eight percent of Germans believe that self-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it to happen in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect to have self-driving cars by 2025, compared with 33 percent in the United States.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven per cent would agree to hand over the controls on all roads for the entire journey.
On the motorway, you could imagine that in flowing traffic, at least 15 percent, in congestion 45 percent.
About 1 in 4 would not under any circumstances let the car take control.
Boll cancels team and doubles in table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer will only be able to fight in singles in the title fight from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision should be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team".
"The boys found out in the morning".
"We are strong enough to win the title without Timo", said German coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a flight to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"The disadvantage is that without Timo we are not such a clear favourite anymore", explained European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"Tim was missing then too, and we became European champions".
"We should be guided by that", said the fifth-ranked world player.
England soccer player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit on a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis of the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a fracture of the tibia.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They're wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer who became a major star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits and with putting men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair".
"It used to be bleached, now it's real", said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk), which will be on view from 18 September in the art gallery of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about himself.
He was against it, because, he said, "to me, an exhibition sounded a little like death".
When you die, you go to a museum.
The impressive collection had previously been seen in Montreal, Canada, and Paris, France.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful dresses", said the art gallery's director, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits offer a glimpse into the still-elusive work of the man who made fashion history without ever having completed a formal education.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellent choreographed work of art, for which a lot of effort was spent: for example, a stylist was hired to haircut the dolls.
14 tons of material have been taken to Munich by the creators, according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna. She is a great actress.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy bear is also on display.
It represents the designer's first, tentative fashion-walking experiments.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he would wear his teddy bra and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have let him.
He later taught himself fashion design.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at other designers' designs, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
But then I bought it.
He couldn't afford to pay for his first fashion show.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of gardin - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long sewing machines and the plain were used to make measurements.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who further processed them into, for example, blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today", explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen Spit, fashion played a greater role, then was displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, in accessories such as bags, and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is an increasing potential for ordering.
The textile industry in Germany is a niche industry.
They already account for half of our orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien trade association together with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, some 80 percent of the sales have been lost.
Private shops and wholesale trade are almost all but gone.
Our products are hardly ever delivered to customers that way.
The mass-produced products are now produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains.
Exports to Russia and the USA are also weak.
So there's plenty of room for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points by being environmentally conscious, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce in an ecologically and socially compatible way".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the businesses, which must think primarily economically", says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often varied only slightly to retain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball cap.
The machine sticks tiny balls in some places.
The Plauene master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not do anything with traditional Plauene lace".
Now she's using the snowball for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, she coins the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of the Plauener Spitze - young and old", says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in and around Plauen and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Spit.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still going to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
But according to Entertainment Weekly, it's not a remake, but a sequel, set 20 years after the first film, with the magical nanny.
It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already set, Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods.
Xi urges to open the economy wider to the world
The economy must open up more widely to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies", he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting new start-ups and pushing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access regulation, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of State-owned enterprises (SOEs), inclusion of private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
The statement is followed by a negative list identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is tested and improved by test programmes.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas are being opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide better services to them", the statement said.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a green card by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their right to practise and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double the limit for mercury in wild fish
The European Commission is proposing to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish, thus giving consumers a much higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper on the subject, sharply criticised the plans: 'Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on in full force to pregnant women and young children,' said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the limits for the neurotoxin in large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks and swordfish, from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for 'economic policy reasons'.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50% of catches cannot be sold.
If the thresholds were doubled, only 14.5% would be unavailable.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
But Foodwatch called it a "trick" because smaller fry, such as carp, are usually so low in stress that they are already meeting the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish was therefore 'a perfidious diversionary manoeuvre that is only helpful to the economy', explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal highly toxic to humans and is highly accumulated across the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government warns that "even small amounts can cause neurological damage, especially in the unborn".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its website that no "health hazard for the general population" is to be expected with regard to the maximum values in force.
Mercury is released into the environment mainly by the combustion of coal.
According to a written report from the Federal Ministry for the Environment to the Greens, Annalena Baerbock, Member of the Bundestag, German coal-fired power stations emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The mercury concentration in fish such as in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "sustained and nationwide exceeded", the Spiegel newspaper quoted the paper as saying in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
