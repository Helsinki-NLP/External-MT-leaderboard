This not only confirms the already widespread theory, such as that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information such as colour and three-dimensional positioning, which the petrified remains could not normally give.
According to scientists, the feathers of these animals were red-brown from above, whitish or brown from below.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of the feathers of birds.
The dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed center called the rachis, but since the feathers had other features such as thorns and spines, researchers concluded that the rachis probably belonged to a later stage of evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, this pattern does not represent the feather of a young bird, but rather that of an adult animal.

Technological determinism is a term for a very broad spectrum of practice, based on a logic where human destiny ranges from technological motivation or imperative to scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
The interpretations of technological determinism are based on two assumptions: first, that technology develops outside of the influence of culture and politics, and second, that it influences natural society rather than social society.

The construction of an international road network for several automobiles was not economically viable, so new methods were developed in the automotive industry to reduce the cost of automobile ownership.

Especially, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting a person's micro-source, it is possible to know if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his article The Presidential Speech showed that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities in understanding human behavior might be inherent in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability: the hidden and the open.

Segregation and recombination carry variations back and forth between the two pools at each generation.
The primate, which has a digestive system similar to that of humans, finds it difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids solely at the expense of the plant resources it can use.

The proteins in leaves and beans would be usable plant resources, but for primates like us, they would be difficult to process without preparation.
Animal products (worms, termites, eggs), on the contrary, are not only easily digestible, but also rich in proteins, which are all non-substitutable amino acids.

In the event of defeat, Germany might have conquered Britain, just as the Allies had conquered the rest of Europe.
The first goats were probably domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10 000 years ago.
Ancients and tribes began to raise them to facilitate the production of milk, wool, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were kept primarily in herds, on hillsides and other pastures, and were often herded by shepherds from the children or youth, whose methods were similar to those of the well-known shepherds.
The first conch was built in England in the 16th century.
Though the conch consisted of simple wooden boards laid in parallel, it was slightly better than the uneven tracks, helping horses to gain higher speeds and carry larger loads.

The main goal of science is to discover how the world is constructed by means of the scientific method, which in practice is the main focus of most scientific research.
The method is not the only one, but rather an experimental  research used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations, which also provide a direction for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible and Latin writings.


The majority of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are primarily dependent on internal cycles and their biological clockwork.
The presence of seasonal rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external stimuli, has been observed in many animals, bacteria, fungi and plants.
Biological clock is a self-powering generator that continues its cycle of free cycles regardless of the presence of external stimuli.
The research of Hershy and Chase was one of the main theories proving DNA to be genetic material.
Hershie and Chayez used phages, or viruses, to transfer their DNA to bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling DNA inside phage with radioactive phosphorus or identifying phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material that mutates, the presence or absence of embryonic line cells, the mutations can lead to different results.
The mutation can only be passed on to the offspring when it is formed in the germ line cells, mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or tumor formation.
Nature tourism is of particular interest to those who travel to natural places with the purpose of admiring beautiful scenery, observing plants and animals.

Three important evaluations for better description of movement flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.

The first animals to soar into the air were insects. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies, making it much more efficient to find food and work.
The ability to fold the wings along the back.
