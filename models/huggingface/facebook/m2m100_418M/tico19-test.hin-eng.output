The rapidly growing accumulative spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulated spread of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which confirms the fact that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in all countries, taking place at different stages depending on the country.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparation for rapid growth in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, the group of pneumonia cases with unknown pharmacy-science was in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China Novel coronavirus, which is now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
The evidence to this day is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them get healed.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% cases, a wicket disease that requires serious care is observed.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of the cumulative spread of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to the Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK between 31 January - 15 March 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the COVID-19 was further geographical expansion and currently the activity in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 epidemic advanced from that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a epidemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases were in accordance with the WHO case definition in the 5th March version of Euroservilance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, France the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with only 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy between 31 December 2019 and that date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths.
Acquisition of the accumulative number and accumulative amplitude of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, the National and Regional Health Authority and the World Health Organization receiving COVID-19 cases informed from each country of the world are updated every morning at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it with the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the short accumulated spread of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of informed cases in each country in the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 compared to Italy from 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
The trend of short accumulative spread of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK usually follows the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and throughout the UK, the overall accumulated scale of COVID-19 began on 21 February and grew rapidly around 28 February 2020 (supplementary content).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases notified from Italy, but the same growing trend was seen in the accumulated spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK (supplementary content).
Image 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases compared to Italy in EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This specifically indicates that 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already notified the total number of comparable cases with Italian cases only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative spread of COVID-19 suggests that the epidemic is growing at a comparative rate in all countries.
It occurs in different stages of the countries, despite the differences in national public health reactions and possibly different case definitions and different protocols to select patients, which should be checked necessarily for confirmation of COVID-19, including holding and examining.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data is not displayed).
However, they should be collected in a subordinate way to complement the current monitoring data that focus on the number of notified cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study found a significant difference in the availability of intensive care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 inhabitants.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than expected from Italy (2010-11 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants).
Intense Care Bed Capacity &gt; 90% risk related hospitalization COVID-19 cases spread with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK Health Care Capacity saturation related proportions are presented in the sixth update of ECDC’s intense risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases still remain in the crowd in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units provide services to the generally defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who are in need of SARS-CoV-2's continuous community broadcasting status and health care, especially in the affected areas of Italy, such as intensive care.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC’s intense risk assessment, with a change in the approach to limiting to suppressing, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires a fast, pioneering and comprehensive approach to slow down, because if the time has not been implemented, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and accordingly optimize their response.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures in removing the effects of epidemic.
To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, countries have very little opportunities to increase their control efforts and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, it is very likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid increase in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
As a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 3,000 people have died from the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and more than 80,000 people have been infected in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Like its sectional virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by scrapers and generates similar symptoms by commodity activity.
However, COVID-19's SARS has a lower severity and mortality rate than is expected, but it is much more transmissible and affects men more than older people and women than young people expect.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article tries to provide a topical and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will include the basic things on epidemic-science, purpose-science, toxic-science, diagnosis, treatment, forecast and prevention.
Although there is still a lot of questions to find answers, we hope this review will help understand the fatal disease and eliminate it.
Because of the epidemic of Novel viral disease on January 25, 2020 Spring Festival has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay at home for a full holiday and several weeks afterwards.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the outbreak of the ultra-intensive respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020 it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19)
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and around 50 other countries in the world.
By 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with hospitalization of more than 40,000 patients caused by the virus and deaths of more than 3,000 patients.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of the people” and is likely more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemic science, purposes of science, diagnosis, and treatment, determining the sequence of the virus by separating from many patients.
This review tries to present the essence of research progress in the new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19’s SARS and other diseases caused by CoV with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in relation to disease prevention and forecast as well as some other yet very necessary questions.
CoVs are mainly considered non-pathogenic for humans with 15% of the common cold 4 generating swelling.
However, in this century we have faced twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible illness and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV eruption in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in picture 1.1, the plants of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first notified to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoV was released.
On 15 January 2020 the first deadly case was from Wuhan.
During this time, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers a transition, which indicated that transition from humans to humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was locked down with the closure of all public traffic.
In the first clinical study on the disease on January 24, it was that only 21 of 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan marine food market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health disaster.
Until the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is growing rapidly, the final spread and intensity of the eruption remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by people of all ages, but mainly from the ages of 30-65 years.
Nearly half of the infected individuals (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very little under 20 years old and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before 23 January 2020 increased rapidly, which corresponds to the widespread traffic before Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%)
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a sub-family of large and overwhelming viruses with a single battle of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., Alpha, Beta, Gama and Delta, of which Alpha and Beta-CoVs are known as infecting humans.
Cover nodes (S) are associated with glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, with its cosial receptor angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diepeptidile peptides 4 (DPP4) and then the membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome becomes unleashed in cosial mass; after the reproduction of the viral genome, the cover creates genome RNA viral pits with glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which later fuses into the plasma membrane for the immunity of the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered a new type of beta-CoV in which more than 99.98% genetic similarity was found in 10 sequential samples collected from the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the over-month sections of the human respiratory substrate.
Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV received.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with human ACE2 with a greater weakness compared to SARS-CoV, which is in line with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 generates less severe infections compared to SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2, orf3b coded Novel may also produce short proteins and orf8 coded extracted proteins.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play a role in viral pathogenicity and can block the expression of IFNβ; although orf8 has no known functional domain or motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. the cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 full-length at 2.9 Å resolution in mixture with amino acid conductor B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which contained free and closed creations, was compiled as a diameter and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could add two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and transition of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a medical target for medical examination to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original medium-sized
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were derived from spiders and were transmitted in humans respectively by covets and cows.
By ethnic comparison of SARS-CoV-2's other CoVs, scratch was considered the primary nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient has helped infect humans by crossing the virus’s species barrier is unknown and the transmission path is still to be clear.
Ji, et al., proposed the serpent as a transmitter of the virus to humans that included the same reintegration with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China pointed out that pagolin - often used in traditional Chinese medicine, long-touch, mice-eating breastfeeding SARS-CoV-2 and CoV found in pagolin are 99% genetic similarity-based possible intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the spread of the difference of 1% in the whole of the two genoms is still a big difference; therefore, determining results are expected for solid evidence (Figure 33) .
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive 48 hours and less than 20 °C and up to 5 days at 40%-50% humidity in artificial environmental dry environments.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation for 30 minutes at 56 °C; therefore, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing detergents, parastic acids, chlorophorms and other fat solvents can effectively deactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally has a lack of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is over-sensitive to the Novel virus.
Currently there is no detailed study regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).4).
Generally, after infiltrating the nutrient of the virus, it is first identified by the intrinsic immune system of the nutrient from C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
By different ways, the virus provokes the expression of proliferation factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFNs) which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophase fegocytosis of viral reptiles.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help prevent the virus from immune reactions.
Soon, an optimized immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in protection.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce viral-specific immunities and CD8+ T cells directly kill virally infected cells.
T-assistant cells produce prothesis-supportive cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Three-food resistance, including supplements and immunities such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, isolated immunities from healed patients deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system generates a very large number of locally-free particles that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst conditions may also cause multiple failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characteristic of the beginning in the grass, is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a greater number of viruses or whose resistance functions are matched are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and its range was from 0 to 24 days.
Based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, a recent study found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the transmission of the virus of infected but non-symptomatic people to others is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to or infected with the virus usually need a quarantine of 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, with which there may be no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, lack of breath, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathing disorders and/or hypoxemia a week after the start of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and cogulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and fever imaging abnormalities even without acute fever should be timely examined for the virus for pre-diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing disorders and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
The same findings were in two recent studies of the family vein and the vein generated by transmission from the non-symptomatic person.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing disorders (55%) as main symptoms.
However, much more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation aid and this corresponds to a higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it has been observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing disorders (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%) were major symptoms and 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation.
Until February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66.576 cases.
Comparatively, by November 2002, SARS death rate was 8.096 10% of confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate based on the June 2012 demographic study was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The first study that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that the spread capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginnings in the grass are often from the same family or the same community or vehicles like the cruise rainfall.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks from the beginning.
However, it has been that people can convey the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and healed patients released from the hospital can re-convey the virus, which warns of prolonging the quarantine time.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lysica cells) in patients is normal or low.
For example, Lessica Cell Calculation &lt; 1×109/L including White Blood Cell Calculation &lt; 4×109/L with lymphopenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased and the blood of most patients increased the absorption of C-reacting proteins and erythrocytes.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of D-Dymers, increased and the cell calculation continued to decrease.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in breast radiography and are displayed by bilateral scatter images or ground glass uncertainty in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lungs damage and acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, the gas exchange is seriously compromised due to uncontrolled supply, mass accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The malignity of type-I and type-II neumocytes decreases the backgroundactive level and increases surface stress and thus decreases the ability of the lungs to flourish and increases the flexibility of the lungs to stop working.
Therefore, the worst outcomes of breast radiography often remain parallel with the most severe condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020 in the first pathological-diagnostic analysis on COVID-19, a patient died of disease observed neumocytes in the lungs, the formation of the hellenic membrane and the porous release of lysica cells, and multidisciplinary multicentric cells that were in line with the pathology and ARDS of viral infection and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcript polymerase chain response (RT-PCR) was used as a major parameter for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could lead to epidemic acceleration, clinical manifestations began to be used in China on February 13, 2020 (which was no longer dependent only on RT-PCR).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and radiological findings is necessary and mandatory for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zheng Group revealed a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which, using depastic, detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA sections on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input) without any detailed equipment required.
If clinical samples are verified, hopefully the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with Novel CoV, doctors can provide primarily assistant care to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases that were first used for treatment or testing the proposed various treatments (Table (Table 2).2) .
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunodeficients, steroids, plasma from healed patients, chemical drugs and psychological assistance.
Plasma from healed patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies have been engaged in developing immunities and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning mainly invades the lungs and possibly other organs in a small range, which express ACE2 such as the cartilage system and kidneys.
However, respiratory slurry and failure remain the main threat for patients and are the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is important to get rid of symptoms and save life and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and entrance mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be assisted by extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO), modified cardiovascular subway technology used in the treatment of life-fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sepsic shock, and the function of important organs are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine stroke is the result of an excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a type of systemic supplier reaction characterized by the immunity of the cytokine series including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to eliminate a large number of free particles which are the main causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunodeficiency is necessary in the treatment of cytokine stroke, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and toxilisumab, IL6 anti-monoclonal immunosuppressants, are used for the treatment of cytokine stroke.
Other immune-depressive treatments for cytokinine storm include changes in the cell-oriented immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blocks; JAK blocks; Blinatumab; cytokin signaling 4 suppressors; and HDAC blocks.
As an immune suppressant of steroids, the transmitter has been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can produce severe side effects dramatically affecting the disease-diagnosis, especially non-conjunctive astiglone.
However, short-term processes of corticosteroids at the following moderate doses are recommended to be used carefully in seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
Until the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remedesiver, a nucleotide analog to be given into the veins, has been found effective in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remdesiver is a Novel antiviral drug developed by Gilliad for the treatment of diseases generated by Ebola and Malberg viruses in the beginning.
Later, Remedevir also showed a potential blockage of other acrobatic RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilliad has supplied compounds to China for two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are suggested as a potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
After combined treatment with iopinavir/ritonavir may occur diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and resistant production from well-made roughs
There has been a long history of blood accumulation from patients healed from a infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from suffering from the disease.
In fact, the blood of healed patients has a relatively high level of immunities to the pathogen.
Immunoglobulin (Ig) is the immune that is produced by B-lesica cells to fight pathogens and other external substances and they identify unique molecules in the pathogens and deactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were healed by COVID-19 and injected in 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with low prevalence and viral load and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are necessary to suggest the method to be used on a large scale.
Also, despite the medical effects, some damage related to plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibiotics can exaggerate the immune response and produce cytokine immunity syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of immunities in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma for treating seriously ill patients is higher.
It is difficult to develop and produce such rapidly specific immunities to fight global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to separate B cells from healed patients and identify the genetic code that codes effective immunities or to examine effective immunities to the essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunities.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in different formulas based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or irreversible as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng G Du Capsules and Lian Hu Quing Way Capsules were found effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Nixia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in COVID-19 treatment in many provinces of China, while Hubei province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM was the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is quite thick comparison because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020 Bolly Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and combined treatment of WM and TCM.
He found that the body temperature in the WM+TCM group was significantly lower than WM group expected for normal, symptoms and hospitalization time.
The most influential, the target degradation rate (light to severe) of the WM+TCM group was significantly lower (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% vs. 39%) compared to the WM group alone.
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for more audited tests in more and more centers at a large level.
It will also be interesting to mark the system of actions and, if possible, to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspicious or confirmed patients with COVID-19 experience a lot of fear of an extremely infectious and fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience humility, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, low-oxyticity and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroid-generated insomnia, can cause more anxiety and mental suffering.
In the early stages of SARS eruption, a number of psychological diseases, including continuous stress, anxiety, anxiety attacks, psycho-stimulating enthusiasm, mental symptoms, prolapses, and even suicide, were.
As part of the public health reactions of the COVID-19 eruption, finding mandatory contact and quarantine; can make people more unhealthy and glanified about the effects of the quarantine on the quarantine and their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public.
Psychological assistance should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to interfere with the transmission of sensitive nutrients from animal funds and infected humans and are supplementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemic caused by frequently growing viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to generate long-term and powerful deactivating immune and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Survivor-generated vaccines have been evaluated in SARS’s biological patterns.
However, these prescribed vaccines in elderly people and deadly challenging forms should still be determined before the beginning of any clinical study.
This is probably because SARS slowly ended 17 years ago and since then no new case has been.
On the contrary, due to the appearance of Junotic sources in epidemic areas, MERS scratch cases and grasses continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using pasive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanocons, viral-like particles and sub-units of re-connective proteins and some have been evaluated in animal forms.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for individuals with non-resistance is a very necessary and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulties due to the long-term requirement in the development of vaccines (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high infection and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health care agencies to make a disease-diagnostic form to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over the age of 50, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have intrinsic surgeries and complications and who did not have such a need were significantly older than expected (51 versus the middle age of 66), which indicates the age as the forecast factor of the COVID-19 patients' results.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has more men infected than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Symptoms and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart damage and infarction.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive colangeocytes that may cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are deeply interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: the level of C-reacting protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of proliferation or tissue damage and is proposed as a potential predictive factor of disease, response to medicine and eventually recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the disease-diagnosis of the CRP level are also proposed.
In addition, increased lectate hydrogenesis (LDH), aspartate aminotransferes (AST), allanine aminotransferes (ALT) and creatinine cines (CK) can also help to predict the result.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are immune during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Main clinical symptoms: with other problems should be considered for the forecast of the results and complications of the COVID-19 of breast radiography and local progress of clinical symptoms.
Using steroids as mentioned above, steroid transmitters are immunodeficient that are usually used as a combination therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-conjunctive asthyglone with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in COVID-19 patients for the following doses and for the short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients suffered extraordinary stress during the outbreak of COVID-19, as they often witnessed the death of six and close family members and associates of long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty.
It is extremely necessary to provide psychological advice and long-term assistance to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, different epidemic-related characteristics from SARS of COVID-19 are seen.
As well as making reproductions in the lower respiratory pathway, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively make reproductions in the upper respiratory pathway and does not generate light or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other coVs that generate swelling.
Therefore, infected patients can generate a large amount of virus during daily activities in the initial phase or incubation period with a lot of difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were very sick, while most transmission did not occur during the initial phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
With the hope to interfere with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, large efforts are ongoing in China, including lockdown in Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of the entire public.
Although these steps are drastically destroying the economy and other regions of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the fluctuation of the epidemic.
The most optimistic prediction is that the eruption will end until the end of March and the variation phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19 which appears much more infectious than SARS will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a pattern to predict the outcome of the epidemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
The Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 was recovered and 2 weeks ago it was identified in both the mid-turbines and throat feaths of patients who went to the hospital, indicating that the new virus identified could become a repeated case like flu.
However, there are hopeful signs from China based on the low number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Initially, one million cases of Ebola were predicted with half a million deaths.
However, by severe quarantine and separation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection is weakened and eventually ends out or becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
The COVID-19 epidemic is compared to SARS and MERS below (picture 55) .
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly mutual from coughing or scratching and direct contact with contaminated substances by the virus.
The virus was also found in the output, which also generates a new possibility of face transmission from the output.
A recent study of 138 cases that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 healthcare providers, were likely to be caused by medical infections.
Therefore, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients should also be very cautious to protect people standing next to or infected people in contact.
The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; the use of both the surgical mask and the N95 respiratory mask (Series # 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Chirurgical face masks prevent drops of fluid from going to the air from a potentially infected person or cling to the surface of things, from where they can go to others.
However, only the N95 (Series # 1860s) masks with only 5% of virions can fully pass can prevent as small virions as 10 to 80 nm from entering the breath; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed above one, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks, rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear isolation coats that fit to reduce and reduce contact with viruses.
The virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus had entered the body through his transmitter eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face arms or glasses while working with patients.
In the affected or potentially affected areas, the general public is strongly suggested that everyone wash his hands with detergent soap more often than usual, try to stay inside the house for self-quarantine and limit contact with possibly infected persons.
Three feet of distance is considered to be appropriate for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus for the human world, as on January 7, 2020, due to the extreme similarity with SARS-CoV, it would be highly warning China on the basis of the deep memory of the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, by January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan's Disease Control Center comforted citizens by saying that the Novel virus has a low infection and limited reproductive capacity in humans and has no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public a lot of fear, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the delicate time came to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn more from it and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be quite cautious when making public announcements because each word is meaningful for citizens and can change their approach and decision; (2) should be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or officials; (3) should be more responsive to limit potential epidemic to the initial phase rather than to try to comfort the public; and (4) should be frequently targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness about the epidemic and periodically monitor and improve the response system of the society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 generated by the Novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to the time of this writing throughout China and 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 eruption has shown that SARS is repeated.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women expect young people, and the severity and mortality rate in older people is also higher than young people expect.
The death rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they are symptomatic, while SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, causing much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
It partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV is expected.
Regular RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, healed patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of viral spread.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain to be solved, which are:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs was found, we can still not reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from the SARS.
The original nutritionist, suppose what kind of animal was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus to humans from the cabbage?
Without finding the answer to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the broadcast and the outbreak can never be repeated.
Although molecular transformation and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, exactly how the virus enters the air path cells and then causes pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 individual cells into other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will it last?
How is the virus genetically developing during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global epidemic, will it slowly end like SARS or will it continue to occur periodically and repeatedly like flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, no matter what price we have to pay, we have no choice but to stop the rapid epidemic and bring our lives into a normal state.
Human corona viruses.
As a result of mutation and adaptation, coronavirus (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) have evolved along with thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to generate mild diseases such as swelling.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection, keeping the situation completely reversed.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs back into light and has shocked us with more infectious capacity but decreased pathogenity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a genetic disease and understanding the genetic origin of HCoVs will be our job.
The majority of HCoVs are derived from scraps, in which they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs also have information about intermediate cush nutrients.
In prevention of human diseases there are direct implications of the identification of animal nutrients.
Examining the mutual actions of the CoV feeders in animals can also put an important insight into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about seven HCoVs, taking into account the history of the discovery as well as the genuine original and intergenital transmission.
Essentially, we compare and see differences of different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and genetic reintegration.
Current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this perspective of epidemic.
In addition, the need to successfully change nutrients and the consequences of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Corona viruses (CoVs) come from the coronaviride family that includes groups of Invalp, Positive-Sensed, Single-Stranding RNA viruses.
These viruses that shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobase in RNA viruses were named “CoVs” due to the crown-like form-science under the electron microscope.
Structually, CoVs contain genoms without sections whose framework is identical.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large over-wide reading frame (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyprotein.
Polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non-constructive proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including Spike (S), Invalp (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N).
Many hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different hereditary CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gama-CoV and Delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and is sub-divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that pimples and mushrooms are mostly genic sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main cows of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually overcome species barriers and have emerged as some important human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 generate light symptoms such as swelling and/or diarrhea.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic in relatively more patients with a greater likelihood of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and over-inflammatory manifestations, producing severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was separated from the nasal flow of swelling patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected by detailed studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which generate self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, this concept was widely accepted that HCoVs infection is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS eruption infected more than 8000 people with a mortality rate of 10% of unread cases is one of the most destructive eruptions in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) eruption caused a continuous epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with the spread of scratches elsewhere in the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic agent, causing 3,120 people to die by March 3, 2020 and more than 91,000 people have been infected.
The warning bell is sounding and the world has to be prepared for the coming SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
All the seven HCoVs are derived from cattle, mice or domestic animals.
Many evidence support the gradual development of all HCoVs, in which viruses are well-adjusted and non-pathic, but show extreme genetic differences.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Exploring the animated source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history of species extinction, motivating power and bonding factors.
It can guide or make it accessible to the search for SARS-CoV-2’s crossing, mediating and enhancing animal nutrients(s) with a significant impact on the prevention of future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the genetic origin, intergenetic transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we emphasize and discuss the common topic that HCoVs patogenic viruses are non-pathogenic in their natural cough nutrients, but become pathogenic after intergenital transmission into new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of HCoV in which increased infection is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 eruption are also discussed in this perspective.
But the information of CoVs is from the end of the 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E breed, which was first separated from the nasic flow of infected common scratch patients, different CoVs were separated from many infected animals, including turks, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified over the past decades.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory path of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was later adapted to grow in the cossical lines of the WI-38 lungs.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E observed symptoms of swelling, including headache, swelling, illness and throat pain with fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated by gradual pathways in the brain of milk drinking mice and by organ enhancement.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection generated by HCoV-229E which are sensitively unprecedented by infection with other respiratory pathogens such as flu A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and are likely to be mainly transmitted during the winter season with temperate weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of both these viruses is less than a week, after which the disease occurs about 2 weeks.
According to a study by human volunteers, slight swelling developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with immunity disability see severe infection of the lower respiratory pathway.
SARS, also known as “Atypic pneumonia”, was the first well-documented HCoV epidemic in human history and the factor for it, the third discovered HCoV, SARS-CoV.
The first SARS case could be marked at the end of 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
8.096 cases of SARS have been recorded with 774 deaths with spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the most spread, it was estimated that two secondary cases could increase due to each case with the gradual development period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral infection occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, symptoms such as muscle suffering, headache, fever, unhealth and cold appear in the beginning, after which breathing disorders, cough and respiratory crises appear as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, extravagant liver function examination and increased creatine cines are common abnormalities related to the laboratory of SARS.
Transmitted atmospheric damage, epithelial cell spread and increased macrophesis are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation later.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, many organs, including the intestinal pathways, liver and kidneys, with typically cytokine stroke, can also be infected in these serious cases, which can be fatal especially for immunosufficient patients.
The virus was first separated from the open lung biopsy of the indicator patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was found to be spread in young children, elderly and respiratory diseases in immune disabilities.
In the diseases generated by HCoV-NL63, the appearance of colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common.
In the second independent study, the same virus was described to be separated from the nose sample of a 8-month boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its extreme occurrence occurs during the early summer, spring and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the inhibitory swinephrase, which is also called a group.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis found from the community, HCoV-HKU1 was also to be associated with severe dementia.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found around the world causing light respiratory diseases.
These all four communities have found HCoVs, well adapted in humans and are usually less likely to mutate to generate highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred from unknown causes as occurred in the rare case of more toxic subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been to cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to be effectively transmitted and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute lungs and kidney failure.
Where most laboratory confirmed cases arise from the Middle East, cases imported with sometimes secondary spread in close connections have been in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second second eruption occurred in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea.
Clinical manifestations of MERS characterized by progressive severe pneumonia match SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has only been observed in MERS in HCoV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From the middle to the end of December 2019, a crowd of full-fledged SARS-CoV-2 infection-related pneumonia patients were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the SARS-CoV-2 infection as an international public health emergency and has also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4% of unread cases.
Remarkably, the Hubei cases death rate in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and respiratory disorders.
It is also seen in some Russians.
Lymphony is one of the most severe symptoms and can rise rapidly as an acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high equality of 82% of the nucleotide sequence, they come into different branches of the genetic tribe.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more mutual than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and seeing variability of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs have seen very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the pathogenic period of HCoV disease and the period of process is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to the HCoVs obtained from SARS-CoV and four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63)
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually observed during the infection of non-specific, light or without any symptoms of HCoVs obtained from the community.
On the other hand, a small drop of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also sees the characteristic forms of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs acquired from the community.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectiousness of HCoVs acquired from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after advancing in humans, such as cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in output samples.
Whether SARS-CoV-2's molecular main transmission plays an important role in at least some circumstances like SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 community can behave seasonally like cases of HCoVs.
However, SARS-CoV-2’s characteristics, including infection, pathogenicity and persistent spread after going to humans, will be influential on the final result of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs obtained from all four communities that generate light symptoms, have become well-adjusted in humans.
From the second point of view, it may also be right that man has been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both ancient HCoV epidemics can survive.
What HCoVs cause serious diseases in humans and what humans develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do so, the accumulation of adapted mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will need to reproduce HCoVs in humans in sufficient scope.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 eruption lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission in humans by quarantaine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs are being transmitted into the human population, generating swelling in immunity disabled patients.
These viruses don’t need a living cush.
On the contrary, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot beined.
They need to remain and spread in their animated cush and possibly find the opportunity to be transmitted to human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and HCoVs obtained from four communities.
At least at the present time it is very infectious like HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will be transmitted to humans without any cox or intermediate animal feeders.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, we will be very helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of gradual development, natural, coch, mediating and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal has a gradually growing nutrient of HCoV, if it gives shelter to the very close ancestor with sharing high equality at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Parental viruses in this nutrient are usually well-adjusted and non-patient.
Similarly, cush nutrients give HCoV a constant and long shelter.
In both conditions, nutrients become naturally infected and are natural nutrients of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient right before or around it before entering humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrition can act as a genetic source of human infection and can play a role of nutrition by allowing the virus to temporarily reproduce and then increasing the level of human infection by communicating it to humans.
If a HCoV cannot keep its transmission within the intermediate nutrient, it can go into a final transition.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also be adapted to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
During this time, the medium-sized nutrient becomes a natural cush nutrient.
Epidemic-scientific data previously observed that the indicator case of SARS had a history of contact with sports animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence examinations indicated that SARS-CoV IgG was more prevalent in animal traders than the general public expected.
In the living animals markets, the masked palm sevet (Paguma larva) and the racon dog were recognized as transmitters of viruses such as SARS-CoV that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly supported by the fact that no SARS was further after all the seats of the markets were killed.
However, it has been that most wild or farms, which are not in contact with living animal markets, are SARS-CoV negative in the mosquito palm sevet, which makes that mosquito palm sevet can be just as serious as the growing nutrients of the middle and not as the natural cush of SARS-CoV.
Remarkably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Guangzhou have SARS-CoV immune, this possibility cannot be denied that many species of small mammals may also be SARS-CoV intermediate enhancing nutrients.
These are all the final nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of SARS-CoV's natural animal nutrients revealed SARS-related Rhinolophus Chammar CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) called a very close Chammar CoV, which is found in Chinese Horse Chammar.
These worms are positive to SARS-CoV-anti-immunities and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have placed the foundation of the new concept that chemagads are the nutrients of emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in spiders but no one except WIV1 has been separated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the grey of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from the samples of scraps was shown to use scraps, scraps and human ACE2 as gray for cosic entrance.
Interestingly, healthy SARS patients were able to deactivate serum WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in cells sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite greater similarity in both these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest parent virus to SARS-CoV and is not the closest coch nutrient to SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
The same nutrient for entering the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus uses the same gray, Dipeptidil peptides 4 (DPP4).
MERS-CoV's RNA-based RNA polymerase sequence is relatively close to the myrtle beta-CoV equivalents identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no surviving MERS-CoV has been found in wild spiders.
MERS-CoV and its closest spider CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence equivalent.
Therefore, cabbage may not even be the closest cabbage nutrient to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that in many African countries, like cows of Middle East origin, cows with cows are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific deactivation immunities.
Live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, is separated from the nasal fats of cows, which indicates that cows are the authentic cush nutrients of MERS-CoV.
It is also remarkable that cows experimentally infected with MERS-CoV were seen with generally light symptoms but too much virus removal.
Remarkably, infected cows remove viruses not only from the respiratory path but also from the output-main pathway, which is also the main pathway to the removal of the virus from the worms.
However, the questions are still present since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with cows before the start of the symptoms, possibly due to human transmission from humans or any unknown transmission pathways that include the species of animals that shelter MERS-CoV.
CoV RaTG13 is separated from the rainbow associated with the rainbow species and shares the SARS-CoV-2 96.2% nucleotide similarity from the rainbow.
Like in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are sufficient to determine parental relationship.
That is, cabbage may not be the nearest cabbage nutrient of SARS-CoV-2, unless in the future almost the same cabbage CoVs are found.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2’s intermediate animal nutrient should be one of the wholesale markets of marine foods sold and killed wild species to which many initial cases of the COVID-19 indicator of human transmission event from potential animals were linked.
A number of recent studies on the basis of matagynomic sequence have suggested that a group of missing small mammals known as pagolin (manis javanika) may also provide refuge to parental beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pagolin CoV genome share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of approximately 90% on the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-generations of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the genetic heritage, one of which 97.4% amino acids share more similar grey binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 sequence equality.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse despite more sequence similarities.
In the first study of sick pancolin, the lung samples also a group of overwhelming viral DNA, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted several different combined methods and manual curations to generate a partial genome sequence with a full length of 86.3% viral genome.
We cannot deny the possibility that pagolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pagolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pagolin-related beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than the SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established in pigs, pagolin and other mammals.
Where the most sequence similarity is found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, the most genome-wide sequence similarity is found in SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
It is a very fictional idea that the extreme similarity between pagolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is selectively caused by the gradual development of mediation.
An alternative proposal is in favour of the re-combination between the third wild organism species of pagolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As the motivating power of gradual development, remixing is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest genetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, genetic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Genetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from spinal CoVs, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in the moisture.
It has been that the ARCoV.2 (Apple Chen Ridge CoV) found in the three-colored shell of North America has been closely linked to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although Camillids are also its suspicious intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the summary of current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoVs' intergenetic transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around the 1890s, respiratory infection epidemic was observed.
The history of intergenetic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs are found quite close to HCoV-229E.
Among them there is an alpha-CoV.
Many evidence support the transmission directly to humans from the spider of the virus.
First, the shared ecology of humans not Alpaca was in contact with candlesticks in the housing.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpaca.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related worms are diverse and non-pathic in alpha-CoV worms, while respiratory diseases occurred in infected animals caused by alpha-CoV.
Finally, Alpaca Alpha-CoV is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpaca HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV is obtained from humans cannot be denied.
In fact, Chammar is the direct source of humane pathogenic viruses, containing Rebecca virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not more surprising that candlesticks can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where alpha-CoVs are genes of HCoV-229E, alpha and cabbage cows may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intergenital transmission to humans from cows and cows from cows.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV is known for its primary recognition and has become even stronger by subsequent findings.
It is clear that the cabbage provides a wealth of viral species for intergenetic exchange and intergenetic transmission of genetic particles.
Long age, density settlements, close social interaction and excessive flight capability are the favourable conditions for all spiders to be an ideal “virus transmitter”.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered cows for decades.
It is well adapted to these cows that have turned from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural cush nutrients.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
It is a transmitting accident in humans and humans remain the final nutrient of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot beined.
Unlike the role of cows in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pagolin in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, then it is different.
Particularly, pagolin beta-CoVs is much more pathogenic in pagolin.
They may be the final nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs like sevet in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of intergenital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, worms can be the coch nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological housing with clayers by killing or mining coal.
Second, pagolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus has newly entered.
People get infected with the virus by killing and gaming meat consumption.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be tolerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Immunological surveys in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 can be re-connected and optimized in a third species that is in contact with both cranberries and pagolin.
SARS-CoV-2 is still being discovered.
In addition to the various types of animal nutrition, three major factors in relation to virals are also important in overcoming the barriers of the type of CoV easily.
First, their relatively higher mutation rate in RNA reproduction.
Compared to other single-tend RNA viruses, the estimated conversion rate of CoV with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacement per year by place 2 depending on the stage of CoV optimization in the new nutrition can be considered “high” from “mediate”.
CoVs contain pro-reading exoribonuclease, whose extinction may also result in excessive variability and degradation or a decrease in life capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remedesiver is considered to suppress the reproduction of CoV by this exoriboneuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remedevir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be examined in clinical trials.
However, the conversion rate of CoVs is ten million times higher than their nutrients.
In addition, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a high level of adaptation in humans.
Per, it has already been adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which has been well-adjusted in cows with cows.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will quickly deactivate vaccines and antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in CoV puts extra plasticity on the genome change for genome mutation and re-combination, increasing the probability of intergenetic co-traumatic development, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel CoVs when the circumstances are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frame and coded protein functions at the third end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly repeatedly change the indicator during RNA reproduction by the unique “copy-choice” procedure.
In the nutrient that works as a mixture character, however, the change often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely identical full-length and subgenomic RNAs, can generate new CoVs by reintegrating.
Genetic evidence of natural re-combination is found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as slurry SL-CoV and slurry CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of viruses-nutritors in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral inter-process with nutrient grey is another important factor affecting intergenital transmission.
Here, the reunification of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choices during interracial transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of viruses between human and sevet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV with mutations on the RBD of specifically S protein is considered to be rapidly adapted in different nutrients.
Usually, the RBD in a CoV’s S protein interact with cochical grape and is selected by nutrient immune reaction with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD S1 is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the section that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-clients for viral entrance.
SARS-CoV’s RBD is able to identify ACE2 customers of various animals, including cattle, sewets, mice and cattle dogs, resulting in the interracial transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid remains were observed different from human and sevet viral sections in RBD and 4 of them are located in grey-binding essence for inter-processing with ACE2 gray.
The RBD of Sevate SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the mutual process of spike protein with human ACE2 gray.
In other words, both of these amino acids can be important in the optimization of virals in humans.
It is remarkable that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cosic grey with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit indicates that the link equality of the S protein with the human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, Crio-EM studies indicate 10 to 20 times more attraction of this joint than the association between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein is expected.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other co-grader will be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Many other HCoV grays exist, such as Aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after intergenital transmission from their animal nutrients.
The result of intergenital transmission of HCoVs is controlled by other nutrient dependency and restrictions factors, in addition to cosic grey.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and HCoVs' natural cush nutrients, such as pimples, pimples and pimples, can become a obstacle to intergenital transmission.
Successful internatal transmission of HCoVs requires the pushing of nutrient dependence factors and the reversal of nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, it remains to identify and describe molecular determinants in this important area of viral-nutrient mutual process.
Using the latest technology of CRISPR, the non-fertile genome examination of SARS-CoV-2 nutritional dependence and restrictive factors can be fruitful.
Recognition of Novel HCoVs: Return on the original basis
The diversity of Cognac CoVs provides sufficient opportunities for the reward of Novel HCoVs.
In this sense, Cognac CoVs, HCoVs work as a gene coch.
In addition, due to acute mutation and genetic reintegration, HCoV also develops and works in two important stages of this process.
For example, Novel has the ability to modify the viral symptoms of the acquisition or loss of protein-coding genes very much.
In SARS-CoV assistant proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related tuberculosis viruses have been separated but found to codify various ORF8 proteins.
The characteristic of SARS-CoVs' 29-nucleotide elimination has been found in race separated at the beginning of human epidemic.
This disintegration breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an optimization mutation that promotes cell transformation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential remix history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs descendants, which identified a very large number of small remix areas in RNA-based RNA polymeres.
Reproduction locations were also identified in the parts of nsp9, most of nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced reunification events among different descendants, which occurred in cows with cows in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, remixing events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs remix with other animal CoVs in their non-constructive genes.
It should also be aware that artificial selection can make irreversible changes in the viral genome, possibly due to viruses free of the drug, such as by the nutritional immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype race due to two-nucleotide disintegration.
While in HCoV-229E-related worms and cattle viruses can be observed antacid ORF4, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide input, resulting in a frame shift.
Finally, but not less importantly, the gradual development of Novel HCoVs also occurs by the pressure of choice in its cush nutrients.
Symptomatic or only light symptoms were identified when scraps were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adaptation between CoVs and scraps.
It seemed that the candlesticks were structually and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory reaction in the candy, effectively reduce the pathogenity generated by CoVs.
In addition, the resistant natural fatal cell activity in mushrooms is suppressed due to the regulation of the natural fatal cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the lower expression level of complex category I molecules.
In addition, the replication of CoV from the high levels of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by more metabolic activity of the puppies may be suppressed and affects proof reading by exoriboneuclease, thus providing a selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic viral races when entering new nutrients.
More pathogenic CoV races can also be developed by remix, which can result in new protein or protein properties for nutritional optimization.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three Novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or generate light symptoms in cows and cows.
Strong nutrient resistant reactions without showing they strongly reproduce.
In it is hidden why unsymptomatic carriers are seen and what are the causes of serious cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are caused mainly by immune reaction and excess activity of cytokine storms, with the more immune reaction, the more severe lungs damage.
On the contrary, in unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from CoV reproduction.
The same strategy of separating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reaction is accelerated in spots.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammatory activation is defective.
From this argument, the blocking of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common subject that generates SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where 95% nucleotide similarity has been observed with the SARS-CoV, the 96% nucleotide similarity is also observed with the SARS-CoV-2 of the beta-CoV.
While sewets and other animals in the markets have been seen to shelter viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the nearest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
SARS-CoV-2 has surprisingly similarly found pagolin beta-CoVs, which indicates that pagolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or may contribute to genetic particles in the final version of pagolin beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally made by humans.
CoVs have come into discussion due to recent SARS-CoV-2 eruption.
The study of CoVs in HCoVs and other animals has made a lot of changes in our understanding of HCoVs' animal funds in genetic origin and standard transmission.
The distinctive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the primary mushrooms and transmitted in humans by intermediate nutrients.
Given that the transition of SARS-CoV is caused by the contact between humans and sewets in the markets, closing the wets and killing the sewets there should effectively eliminate the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, because of the discovery of many descendants of pagolin beta-CoVs quite close to SARS-CoV-2, pagolin should be removed from the weight market to prevent genetically transmitted.
However, what SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted into humans by pancholine and other mammals and how it remains to be clear in future tests.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered cows for decades.
These cows are an important means of traffic for local people as well as the main sources of meat, milk, leather and wave products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to give up all the cows to control MERS as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread.
A comprehensive approach to developing effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for cows in combination with other infection control measures should be adopted to prevent repeated MERS outbreaks.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genetic forms may appear to produce eruptions.
Various animated CoVs are rotating in wild animals.
Specifically, Coventry CoVs with animated capacity are very diverse.
It is quite likely that these genetic CoVs will have personal development and reintegration, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that will be more infectious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some areas of China should give up the culture of eating.
With the hard test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plan should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cush until there is no possibility of spread.
Though pimples have many characteristics that help spread viruses, if people are educated about staying away from pimples, the likelihood of humans' contact with them and other wild species can be minimized.
To better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients, the continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary which will prove useful in preventing human transmission from the animal and future eruptions.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral genital disease is to keep humans away from the ecological resorts of natural cells of genital viruses.
Many organs of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if the candlesticks transmit the parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pinguin, it will be interesting to see in which circumstances the candlesticks and the pinguins can share the same ecological residence.
Secondly, if the worms play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans are exposed to the worms.
Thirdly, if a third breastfeeding acts as a real intermediate nutritionist, it should be clear how it interacts on different species, including humans, pigs and pogolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, can be tolerable to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.
Whether it’s chickens, pandolins or any other breastfeeding, it’s expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their parental viruses that are almost identical, will be identified in their natural nutrients in their future.
Continuous research in this area will clarify the progressive pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of COVID-19's " suspected cases" and "proof cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team published the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Quick Advisory Guidelines, and this guidelines provide the appropriate reference to our experience and the worldwide fight against this epidemic.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually growing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria for "such cases" and "such cases" in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has occurred, which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Extremely Intensive Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO marked COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually growing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has issued a total of seven versions with fundamental changes in some contexts in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Now a comment by Zhou et al. on our guidelines, he has presented a simple indication proposal based on his clinical experience.
His work also gave new evidence pairs in our guidelines and valuable references to this epidemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh version (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis to confirm the suspected case requires the combination of any item of the epidemic history with two items of clinical manifestations, or, if there is no clear epidemic history, the completion of three items of clinical manifestations:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or residence in the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were in the last 14 days before the symptoms began; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was in the last 14 days before the symptoms began; (4) history of contact with the group of confirmed cases (the history of contact with the group of fever ≥ 2 cases and/or small areas such as home, office, school, etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective properties of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells indicates normal, decreased or low lymphocytes in the early stages.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with one of the elements of pathogenic or serial evidence which are as follows: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 comes positive; (2) the viral whole genome sequence shows high compatibility with the known Novel coronavirus; (3) the Serum test is positive for the specific IgM immunity and IgG immunity for SARS-CoV-2; or the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG immunity negative to positive changes, or the improvement of the improvement phase is increased by ≥ 4 times.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then the seventh version was added serial evidence.
These amendments were based on the continued work of researchers, who explore samples of an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as blood samples, increasing the availability of different samples, and supporting the introduction of specific immune positive results to confirmed standards.
In addition, there are many evidence that remind us to be cautious with unparalleled targeting and isolating patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The point system needs to be verified in further clinical practices and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "such cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest to explore and follow the latest guidelines of their homeland countries.
Our team will also update your guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new deaths from COVID-19 occurred in Bangladesh, the highest one-day figure ever
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the largest number of deaths from this virus in one day.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 people who were healed from the disease while living at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirzadi Sabrina Flora that four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two patients were older than 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that there were two of the dead.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global epidemic on March 11.
A hospital official told a local news center, Anadolu agency that the deceased was named Jalal Safur Rahman who was a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission and was taking care of him at the Kuwait Friendly Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s road transport and bridge minister, Ubadul Qadar, said that road transport will be closed for longer than previously planned until next Saturday.
The public transport interdiction began on March 26 and had to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of necessary goods such as medical goods, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two men and one of them who returned from Italy on March 8.
On March 19, they were all well.
Over a million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide
Statistics from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded a million.
The disease caused by coronavirus COVID-19 is observed by associating at least 52 thousand deaths.
The day that this figure passed, the same day the first corona virus infection in Malawi and the first death from the corona virus in Zambia was.
North Korea claimed that until Thursday it was one of those countries that are still free from coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization has 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases that occurred in twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on April 4, according to Central European time.
More than 2 million 44 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, causing at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from the Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. were caused by the corona virus on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even more rigorous measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city to May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that until April 30 the Russians will continue to receive wages without going to work.
The Portuguese parliament refused to extend the national emergency period for 15 days; the proposal was passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted against it.
Saudi Arabia has set twenty-four hours of cruise in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the first cruise was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand has planned to put curve from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. in the morning.
Ohio Governor Mike Dwayne has announced that the order to stay at home in the state has been extended to May 1.
Australian stores cut the number of toilet papers that can be purchased in a bar
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworth and Cols limited the number of toilet papers that can be purchased in one bar in all their stores at the national level to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI also applied a single-pack limit on Monday.
These boundaries were posted on check-out sites and as messages on the Facebook pages of series.
It is that the buyers were collecting for the situation of having to keep themselves the most different due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Wallworth also limited the limit to buy toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Before these changes, Wallworth and Cols had prohibited the purchase of a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5.
Cols said in his 8 March press release that despite the prohibition of four-packing being enforced, “the stock is being terminated within an hour of delivery in many stores,” and said that demand was unprecedented, while ALDI said it was “unpredictable” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Woolworth, last week the sales had a “strong rise”.
The stores of Costco located in Kenbra had also limited the amount to two packs last week.
To further reduce the decline, Colls gave suppliers more orders of large packages and also increased the frequency of delivery.Wallworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI raised stocks to provide the planned Wednesday special as soon as possible.
Australian Retail Association Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said Retailers try to increase stocks, but it becomes difficult to do so due to the restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery.
In such cases when suppliers are trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already decreased, the production costs of Russell are expected to increase.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released in advance, some stores cannot operate Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, Dr. Gary Mortimer said that stores fill stocks every night.
He explained that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in a greater number, and then, when all stocks are sold, the big-big shelves behind are leaked, making the decline noticeable and hard.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, “Colls and Woolworth’s idea is [that] if there were enough items on the shelf, and products such as toilet paper and sanitizer could be purchased and present in large amounts, the shelf could probably be reduced.”
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Hu Gives A. Crap, said last Wednesday that his stock has been closed.
According to News.com.au’s report, the Cleanse Toilet Tishu manufacturing company Kimberi-Clark, and the Sorbent manufacturing company Solaris Paper emphasized that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com that in Melbourne, where less and less auctions are being carried out due to buyers celebrating holidays on the long weekends of the Workers' Day, some real estate sellers are giving free toilet paper to those who make the first offer in the auction.
A daily printing in Darwin, the Thursday version of NT News had an eight-page insert that was given to be used as a cutting toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, the stores were not willing to ban at the beginning; in the report he said he had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further stated that there is also a heavy demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry things, handwashes and garlic.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, two packs of 12-rolls were also applied on the purchase of Andres Toilet Paper in the online British supermarket Ocado.
World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global epidemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus SARS CoV-2 disease COVID-19 as a global epidemic.
Although the word “global epidemic” means only how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to act.
“Every country can change the path of this global epidemic right now.
If the country detects the disease in its response, treat the patients, keep them the most distinct, point them and unite them,” said the Director-General of the WHO, TEDROS ADNOM GABRIOSIS.
“We are extremely concerned about both the worrying level of spread and severity and the worrying level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Freden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global epidemic is “unprecedented.”
In comments published by CNN in February, he said, “Another respiratory virus except the flu has not been identified from the continuous global spread.”
Gibride also revealed something similar when he said, “We have not seen a global epidemic from a coronavirus until today.”
He added, “And we have not seen a global epidemic that can be controlled at the same time until today.”
This new degree of global epidemic, the aforementioned outbreak in January, has been given after the WHO’s phase of declaring an alarming public health emergency internationally.
Anthony Fochie, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about the outbreak, “One thing of a hundred things, it’s going to be worse.”
The Associated Press that by Thursday there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019–20 Coronavirus epidemic is an ongoing epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, its epidemic was identified in China's Wuhan, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was declared an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been in 210 countries and regions, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The case death rate in China is estimated to be 4%, while worldwide it is between 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory crisis syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also be from two to fourteen days.
It has no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is targeted and assistant therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from others and monitoring and self-sufficiency for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted by implementing travel restrictions, quarters, courtyards, workplace threat controls and facility closures.
This epidemic has generated a serious global socio-economic disorder, has motivated to postpone or cancel sports, religious, political and cultural events, and has led to a widespread decline in supplies by scared shopping by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationally or locally, affecting 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
False information about the virus has spread online, and there have been phenophobia and discrimination events against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and Southeast Asian origin and color, and other people from areas with more viral cases.
Due to low travel and heavy industry closure, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (Hubei province's capital) the collective cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and launched an examination in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the wholesale market of seafood and therefore the virus is considered a genetic originator.
The epidemic spreading virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, which is a new discovered virus that is closely linked to the coronavirus, the pancoline coronavirus and the SARS-CoV. Later on 1 December 2019 the first known person with symptoms was discovered to get sick, and the person after that person had no visible relationship with the group of meat markets.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases in December 2019 were found related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, a non-verified report by South China Morning Post that a case was of a 55-year-old man in the Hubei province on November 17, 2019, which could be the first case. on February 26, 2020, the WHO that with a decline in new cases in China, Italy, Iran and South Korea have suddenly increased, the number of new cases outside of China has first exceeded the number of new cases within China.
Especially people with light symptoms may have very little reports of cases recorded.
Until February 26, relatively low cases were in young people, of whom people aged 19 and younger were 2.4% of worldwide cases. United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wales, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before obtaining effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people in whom COVID-19 has been tested, and according to the official protocol whose testing has been positively confirmed.
Until March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies that they didn’t just test people with light symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the cases.
The initial estimate of the original reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 get healed.
In those who are not healed, the time from the development of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, of which the most common is 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, COVID-19 had caused 97,000 deaths.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had already existing health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official calculation of deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic generally refers to the dead found positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing such as at home, in nursing home, etc.
Parcial statistics in Italy found that the additional deaths occurring during the epidemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID deaths.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the alleged number of deaths] has been newly estimated", a statement that is supported by low-calculation descriptive information in the U.S. Such newly estimated occur in epidemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of main land China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in the main land outside of China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
Until March 13, deaths were in more than 40 countries and regions on each continent except for the Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to area and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the options of treatment, the time and population characteristics since the early eruption, such as age, gender and general health. The mortality ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality ratio to 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number changes according to the area.
In China, the estimated mortality ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting from 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which refers to the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which refers to the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timely and follow a specific population from infection to the case's recovery.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific praise.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that a total epidemic infection death rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this limit corresponds to the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that epidemic can be controlled.
The extreme and final period of the eruption is uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
McCain Bonnie of the Pen State University said, “When uncontrolled leaves, infectious outbreaks normally become stable and begin to decline when nutrients are not available for the disease.
But when it will be, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction about it now.”
China’s senior medical adviser Zhang Nanshan argued that “this could end until June” if all countries follow the WHO’s advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will be circulatory for one or two years."
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distances and other measures will be required "unless a vaccine becomes available (probably: 18 months or more)"
William Shephner from Wanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will completely disappear, because it's very easily spread" and it can "convert into a seasonal disease, which returns every year."
The agility of returning group will depend on the limits of immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be isolated.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cafe), low smell sensation, breathing flushes, muscle and joints pain, throat pain, headache, coldness, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or nylema. According to the WHO, one in six people get seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty in breathing, constant chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty awakening, and bleeding of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms occur. More development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory crisis syndrome, sepsis, septic trauma and death.
Some of the infected people may be isolatory, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked in order to eliminate the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the isolatory ratio is from some to 44%.
The normal pathogenic period (the time between the infection and the beginning of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the percentage of people with COVID-19, who had lost their sense of smell, was at first 30% and later decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease spreads mainly through small drops generated during close contact and during coughing, scratching or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without mouth covering drops can go from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small drops generated during speech that last longer in the air. breathing drops can also occur during breathing, including while speaking, although the virus is not generally ventilated.
Drops can go to the mouth or nose of those who are nearby or may go by breathing into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as canal tendency and cardiovascular therapy (CPR) may result in respiratory excretion and thus may result in ventilated spread.
It can spread even when a person touches a damaged surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it may spread through the outbreak, its risk is considered less.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of moisturizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. the virus is most infectious during the first three days after the beginning of symptoms, although communication may be possible before and in the subsequent stages of the disease.
Three days before the beginning of the symptoms, the tests for the disease of people came positive, indicating that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of isolatory cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but isolatory transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other individuals.
In particular, the virus was found detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, for a day on the cardboard, and for four hours on copper.
However, it varies depending on moisture and temperature. tests for pet and other animals have come positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can go from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after they come into contact with animals, as is done after contact with other surfaces touched by the infected person.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an innovative virus, first separated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronavirus present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap, which disrupts its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that this is a viral genetic origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus genetically belongs to the group of math beta-coronavirus, subregional surbacovirus (generation B).
It is 96% similar to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of amino acid in some parts of the genome sequence between the viruses and the pandolins and the viruses from humans.
Until now, compared to the entire genome, the general genetic content between the pandoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found at a maximum of 92% which is insufficient to promote the pandolines as intermediate nutrients.
Temporary infection by the virus can be identified on the basis of the symptoms, although confirmation is eventually from the reverse transcription of the infected output from the polymerase series reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although many of its image characteristics are less specific with similarity to other nymony and pathological processes.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to examine or diagnose COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase series reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is done on nasagrasni faah, but one throat faah can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect the immune.
By April 6, 2020, no one of these has been sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
At the targeted people's radiography and computed tomography (CT) analgesic image characteristics include untouched peripheral ground glass uncertainty and absent fungi emissions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to its similarity with other infections such as adenovirus, without confirmation by PCR, the identification of COVID-19 has a limited specificity of imitation.
A large study in China compared the CT results of the chest with PCR and it was shown that although it is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening means in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based rotating neural networks have been developed to detect viral imitation characteristics with both radiography and CT.
To prevent the transmission of the disease, the strategies includeining general good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or scratching in a tissue and placing that tissue directly in the waste box.
Those who may already have an infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures of making physical distances to prevent transmission are also recommended. Many governments have banned or advised not to come and go in all unnecessary countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don’t know where and how they were infected. Care providers care for an infected person are recommended to take standard warnings, contact warnings and protect the eyes. Contact monitoring to health authorities is an important way to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has increased confidentiality concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement on the limits of such monitoring.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log close to one user’s other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with a person who came to the COVID-19 test positive. misconceptions about the methods of prevention of infection are spreading; for example, throwing the nose and throwing the mouth wash is not effective.
No COVID-19 vaccine is available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after nose spraying, coughing or scratching.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
Additionally, CDC has recommended using at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water are not easily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected by a number of solutions, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropenol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidon-iodine (within a minute of exposure to a disinfectant to the surface of a stainless steel).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons should be disinfected if COVID case is suspected or confirmed.
Health organizations recommend that people turn their mouth and nose with a corner or cover them with a tissue when coughing or scratching and then treat any tissue immediately.
The surgical mask is recommended for those who may be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the amount of drops out of the breath and the fixed distance from speaking, coughing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hygiene of the hands."
WHO has recommended that healthy people wear mask only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the United States, CDC recommends the use of non-medical face mask made of clothes. China has especially recommended the use of treatable medical masks by ordinary healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with others (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transportation or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make clothing face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear a face mask when they go to public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has forced all persons entering the food store to wear a face mask.
Israel has urged all citizens to wear a face mask when they go to the public area.
Since mid-March, Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day, has forced passengers to wear face masks on railways and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it compulsory to wear a face mask when going out, while it is also recommended to make a home-made face mask for those who cannot buy a face mask.
The face mask has also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance creation (also called physical distance creation) includes transitional control functions, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel ban; and the closure of schools, workshops, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply methods of making social distance by living at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact welcomes, and physically removing themselves from others.
Many governments are now obligatory or advising to create social distances in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The rapid decrease in the maximum population recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was made from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public community of more than two people. Elderly adults and individuals with intrinsic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and degraded immune system are at a higher risk of serious diseases and complications and they are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to change the use of the word "create social distance" with "create physical distance" in order to make it clear that the goal is to maintain social or so effective physical contact.
The use of the term "create social distance" resulted in the consequences that people should adopt complete social separation instead of encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during epidemic.
These include only recommendations to make sex with the person who lives with you, who has no symptoms of a virus or virus.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended home self-infection.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for appropriate self-determination. Many governments have mandatory or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The hardest self-quarantine instructions have been issued in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have come into contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission, are advised to do self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the final potential risk.
A outbreak control strategies are resistance or oppression, and suppression.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of the eruption and its purpose is to detect infected people as well as to apply other measures and vaccinations to control the infection in order to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, then efforts go into the dementia stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of both prevention and suspension measures can be done at the same time.
More extreme measures are required for suppression, so that the epidemic can be reversed by reducing the original reproductive number to 1. A part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is trying to reduce the extreme limit of the epidemic, which is known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of extreme health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that can manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face mask and self-quarantine; presumed community measures to create physical distance such as shut down schools and cancel collective assembly programs; community participation to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures are used to clean surfaces such as environmental measures.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched large-scale investigations and localized quarters, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected people who quarantined themselves and penalized those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that there are major challenges in shaman (lattering but not stopping the spread of mahari) and suppression (reversing the development of mahari).
Optimal dementia policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care to 2/3 and death to half, but even after this hundreds of people die and health systems become extreme.
Repression can be given priority, but it needs to beined until the virus is spreading into the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is the first), otherwise the transmission from scratch in measures returns faster.
Long-term intervention for the suppression of epidemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 are approved, but development efforts, including testing of existing drugs, are ongoing.
Taking prescription-free cold-sugar medications, drinking fluids and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intramuscular fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may make the results worse.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being examined for their use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and domestic treatments" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
COVID-19 Increases capacity to the needs of patients and optimizes health care, has been described by the WHO as a fundamental epidemic response remedy.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and WHO has issued guidelines for the transfer of resources at several levels for hospitals and primary health care services, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, repealing selective processes whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There is not a lot about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may occur.
The first known case of Novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the wholesale market of Hunan marine food, which also sold living animals, and one is that the virus came from one of this kind of animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. Unknown cause pneumonia group was observed on December 26 and which was treated by the physician Zhang Zhxian in the Hubei provincial hospital, who was informed to the Wuhan Jiangan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police warned eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, and another physician, I Feng, was scattered by his elderly.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A large number of cases of unknown pneumonia were to the health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in the start of the examination in early January. During the early stages of the eruption, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year and being a transport and Wuhan transport center and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China about 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that by 20 January 2020 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. by 26 March, the U.S. has exceeded China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. by 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.

Due to increasing concerns about the coronavirus epidemic on February 27, various U.S. stock indicators, including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 Index, Dove Jones Industrial Average, the fastest decline since 2008, with Dove falling 1,191 points, which is the largest decline in a day after the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indicators dropped more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scop Rating GmbH confirmed China’s all-powered creditworthiness determination, butined a negative expectation.
Based on coronavirus fears, stocks fell again, the greatest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people believe the possibility of an economic decline.
Economist Mohammed al-Arian praised emergency measures at the time of central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to the advice of the governments to close public places including traffic prohibitions, tourist attractions, any travel in the whole world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, canceled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline’s flight collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry has been the most seen to date.
Many train stations and boat ports have also been closed.
The time of this epidemic also corresponds to the major travel session associated with Chinese New Year's holidays, the time of Chongqing.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, have been cancelled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies are freely closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Month New Year’s celebrations and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent collective celebrations including Forbidon City and traditional temple fair.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's Holiday to 10 February, in which most workshops were ordered not to reopen until that date.
These areas represented 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, which closed schools until March and canceled its new year celebration. the retail sector has been affected globally, with the hours of stores decreased or temporarily closed.
The tour of retailers in Europe and Latin America has decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East retailers saw a 50-60% decline.
In comparison with February, the number of people walking to shopping centers in March fell by 33-43%.
Worldwide shopping mall operators have taken additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, setting up thermal scanners to check the temperatures of shoppers, and canceling ceremonies. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the epidemic-driven recession may leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who are not in that situation without the epidemic.
In January and February 2020, during the extreme epidemic in Wuhan, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s approximately 300 million rural migrant workers have been stuck in domestic provinces or stuck in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus epidemic could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could fall to 32% according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates.Many million migrant workers have become unemployed due to locked in India (which are paid through daily wages).A survey by Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some kind of unemployment since they went to locked in mid-March 2020, 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal loan plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-funded short-term work plans called Kurzarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
Exhibition art and cultural heritage areas have been much more affected by the epidemic, which has affected the operation of organizations worldwide as well as individuals both employed and independently operating.
Organizations in the art and culture sector strived to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the security of their employees and the public and to maintain their mission to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and in different records, museums, libraries, exhibition sites, and other cultural institutions were closed for an indefinite period with their exhibitions, ceremonies and exhibitions cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. Recently another and the rapidly growing result of the disease is to cancel religious services, main sports celebrations, and other social celebrations, such as music celebrations and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the observation of the Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Lent Christian Session, was cancelled.
Many bishops’ districts have recommended the elderly Christians to stay at home instead of to be present on Sunday; some churches have provided church services through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop Area of Rome closed its churches and prayer halls and empty Christian pilgrims from St. Peter Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish worship houses, temples and gardens and restricted public ceremonies.
Iran’s Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in the areas affected by the epidemic and the later closing of pilgrims, while Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims and citizens from entering holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The epidemic has caused the most important disruption in the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sports programs, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The planned summer Olympics of 2020 was interrupted by the outbreak, which was originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "re-established on a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". casinos and other gaming sites around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
As a result, many gamblers are adopting the online method, which has a significant increase in new registration rates in many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, in which different music groups have suspended or cancelled musical programs.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all the performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the internet as an option of traditional live performance, such as making live streaming of music programs to perform, distribute and promote their work or web-based "smarohs".
On-line, many coronavirus-theme internet memes have spread as humour and disturbance among uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing predictions, xenophobia and racism have been noticed towards people of Chinese and Eastern Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Many countries, especially Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region have seen fears, doubts and hostilities.
From February in the reports (when most cases were still limited to China), the racist feelings of Chinese people in different groups around the world have been documented to be worthy of receiving the virus or obtaining justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese spirit.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Online and offline assistance is available for Chinese people and people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the progress of eruption in new hotspot countries, the people of the first European country in Italy who experienced the severe eruption of COVID-19 may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed requests to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to prevent this disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan appeared on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States have increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", which was considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign persons from Vuhan to Novy Sanjari.
Students from northeastern India, whose border is connected with China, who study in major Indian cities, have allegedly experienced disturbances related to the coronavirus epidemic.
The President of the State Unit of the Indian People's Party in West Bengal, Dillip deklar, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "this is why God has repented them."
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were promoted by epidemic, describing foreigners as targeted for "foreign waste" and "depletion".
Many newspapers with Pevals removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific paper related to eruption with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on printed servers such as bioRxiv.

Respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory examinations include methods to detect the presence of the virus and to detect the immunities produced as a response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunity detection (blood-science) can be used for both diagnosis and people's monitoring.
Immunological examinations show how many people have been sick, including those whose symptoms were too light to inform or who were unsymptomatic.
The results of this examination can determine the accurate death rate of the disease and the level of collective resistance in people.
Due to limited inspections, by March 2020 none of the countries had reliable figures on the spread of the virus in people.
Until March 23, no country had checked more than 3% of its population and there are considerable inequalities on how much in different countries has been checked.
Reported cases of this inequality are also likely to significantly affect the mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly more predicted in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription, using polymerase channel reaction (rRT-PCR), can be checked on respiratory samples obtained by different methods, including narcotic foam or mucus samples.
Usually the results are available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR examination with throat spots is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample material can then be taken from the airway from the inside by a sweating catheter or the material out of the cough (bullgum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase channel reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 sets by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Koganbiotek developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval for emergency use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 check kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been distributing its 2019-New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories by the International Reserve.
In the older versions of the test kit, one of the three genetic tests found untouched results due to defective indicators, and created problems in the CDC testing in Atlanta; due to this, the average of successfully processed samples in February 2020 remained less than 100 samples per day.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020 and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start the test.
The inspection was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. U.S. business laboratories began inspection in early March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, Labcorp announced the availability across the country of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has provided COVID-19 testing across the country by 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations have been announced; samples must be collected and processed according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test of COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 this examination was registered by the Federal Service for Survival in Healthcare. on 12 March 2020 it was to develop the examination to detect the COVID-19 infection in the Mayo Clinic. on 13 March 2020 the Rush Diagnostics was permitted by the FDA for high-volume examinations within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 examinations from a machine in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authority (EUA) to the Abbott Laboratories for the inspection of the Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA first issued the same authority to the Holological, Laboratory, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020 the same way, Sheffield received a check from the FDA that took about 45 minutes, for EUA.
The FDA has approved a test in which is used the Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase production for 50,000 tests every day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan using monoclonal immunosupplements that are associated with the Novel Coronavirus's nucleocapside protein (N protein), with the hope that this intense flu test can result in 15 to 20 minutes.
A literary review of March 2020 concluded that “in the early stages, breast radiography has less clinical importance, while CT [computered tomography] findings may be available even before the symptom begins.”
The specific characteristics of CT include bilateral multi-lobular ground-glass opesification with peripheral, untouched and post-distribution.
As the disease grows, the effect of subplural, crazy pewing and consolidation develop.
The current source point of epidemic, a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that with many representative characteristics of CT being similar to other lungs and pathological processes, although less specific, it is notably more sensitive than PCR is expected.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT’s COVID-19 should not be used as an examination or first-line examination for the diagnosis.” by March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for primary examination.
The part of the resistant response to infection includes the production of immunities including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine the resistance that begins in individuals 7 days after the symptoms begin or around it and to detect infection for people monitoring tests can be tested in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automatic systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see the resistant response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is generally obtained from the skin punch.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 units that provided information to the agency if necessary and thus are now able to deliver their immune tests.
By 7 April 2020, only one examination was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. By the end of March 2020, Euromune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Aptoop Diagnostics received European approval for their examination sets that can detect IgG and IgA immunities against the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to check hundreds of samples within a few hours and therefore it is quite faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
In early April, the UK found that any immunity check kit they bought was not good enough for use.
Hong Kong has made a plan in which suspicious patients can live at home, “The emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube,” they will go back and get the results of the examination in a short time. British NHS has announced that they are starting to plan to check the suspicious cases at home, which removes the risk of infecting the patient’s others if he goes to the hospital or removes the risk of disinfecting the used ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Statuary Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that in the ambulatory setting they had their capacity to do 12,000 tests per day and made 10,700 tests last week.
When the examination order is given by the physician, the cost is raised by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Coach Institute, the total capacity of Germany is 160,000 tests per week.
Up to March 19 drive-three checks were offered in many major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were.
The first laboratory survey found that by week 12/2020, including week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested and 33,491 (6.9%) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technical and Rembrandt Hospital combined samples and if the combined sample is found positive, then further examination developed a method to test samples from 64 patients together and tested it. In Wuhan, BGI "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese language: Eye, or in English "EyeFire 2000") was able to start a period of more than 10,000 samples in a period of time, starting with a period of more than 5 days in 2020.
With the construction supervision by BGI's founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if the capacity to check it was not started, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47% higher and the related cost of dealing with quarantine would be doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory’s Huo-Yin laboratories have been immediately followed in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multi-signed open source frameworks have been issued by ORIGAMI ASCE that can use 93 tests to examine up to 1122 samples of COVID19 patients. These balanced frameworks can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Before March, the deficits and insufficient amounts of applicants remained a problem in large-scale inspection in the EU, UK and the US.
It motivated some authors to explore protocols to prepare samples that include heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to eliminate the RNA genome for further examination. March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now examining their population's coronavirus at a rate per person more than any other country, and was on the way to increase the level of examination to reach a large level of population.
This was due to the combination of drive-three testing capabilities and the purchase of population-scale mass-three laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to do thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory in the world to work on such a large level outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted and sent Germany's method for the construction of kites to develop low-income countries with lack of resources.
The law of Germany was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which delayed the availability of tests in the U.S. At the beginning of the eruption there were problems on the reliability of the investigation kit between China and the U.S. and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient sets to meet the investigation demands and recommendations by health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of Novel coronavirus.
Inspection capabilities, in private sector laboratories, have been developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing the screening programmes is the best way to slow the increase of the COVID-19 epidemic. Due to the greater demand for screening due to the widespread spread of the virus, thousands of exhaustive tests in private U.S. laboratories have become crowded and the supply of phosphorus and chemical detectors has become stressful.
In March 2020, China accuracy issues in its investigation sets.
In the United States, the CDC-developed check sets were “comi”; the government then removed bureaucratic obstacles that stopped private inspections. Spain bought check sets from Chinese company Shenzhen Biotechnology Company Limited, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that the wrong results may be caused by failure to collect samples or use the kit properly.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove the wrong checking kit and replace it with the second checking kit that Shenzhen Biozhi has installed. 80% checking kit purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million checking kit from China, which were not found accurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be placed in the Danube.Turkish Ministry of Health Ateş Kara said that the check sets purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and they “no used them.”The UK, which bought 3.5 million test sets from China at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
The results were positive from the quarantine and the detection of the people who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 positively.
The place of death from the first COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the town of Vou in Italy examined twice the total population of approximately 3,400 people in an interval of about ten days.
Nearly half of people with positive results had no symptoms, and people with all found cases were quarantined.
New transitions from the travel ban on the arriving place have been completely ended.
Aggressively detecting contacts, interdicing domestic travel, checking and quaranting, but with extreme restrictions such as strongly closing restaurants and retail facilities, the 2020 coronavirus epidemic rises quite slowly than other developed countries in Singapore.
Many programs have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home from March 28, but school holidays open again on March 23.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the epidemic by detecting contacts, by prohibiting domestic travel, by checking and quaranting, but by less aggressive lockdown.
Statistical studies have shown that countries where the number of deaths has been checked more than expected have a very low case death rate, possibly because these countries are more able to detect only light or non-symptomatic people.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to investigate and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmation examination.
Of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column “% of positive in surveys” is affected by the country’s surveys policy.
As with other things, in a country where only hospitalized persons are examined, there will be a higher percentage of positive examination than in a country where all citizens are examined, whether or not symptoms appear in them.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the task of cleaning your hands with the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regularly washing hands with soap at any "necessary moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and haizes, which are transmitted through the main output.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common swelling, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., the mucus membranes).
Five important moments during the day where it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after the shower, after the cleaning of the baby's shell or changing the longot, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing meals or before and after the consumption of raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing the hands at the following times:
Before, during and after food preparation.
Before and after taking care of the sick person.
After changing the dish or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After your nose is sprayed, coughed or scratched.
After touching the animal, animal harvest, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to clean the pathogens (bacteries, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause the disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases by hand.
This is important for those who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for ordinary people.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the death rate of newborn babies in case of birth at home.
A 2013 study found that practices of well washing hands in children under the age of five may make a little improvement in their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce the infant death rate associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote handwashing can reduce the cases of diarrhea by a third, and it is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Reduction of 48% in cases of diarrhea may be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap as an automatically motivated behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and deep respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 18 million children dying every year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia causes approximately 35 million children's deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, making a strong habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can survive more than one vaccine or therapeutic remedy, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by half and the number of deaths from intense respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning arrangements as part of water, cleaning and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can damage the skin due to skin drying.
A Danish study of 2012 found that overwhelming hand washing could cause swelling, layer skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health professionals.
Too often handwashing is also seen as a symptom of psycho-binding disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission from the principal path of the disease: after the use of the toilet (urine infusion, eruption), after the cleaning of the baby's nuts (after the change of longot), before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing meals or raw meat, fish, or poultry before/after consumption.
Other occasions when appropriate handwashing techniques should be practiced to prevent the transmission of disease are: before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after scratching, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching waste.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of families adopted the practice of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; in the United States with 77 per cent this rate was moderate; and in China with 23 per cent this rate was the lowest.
The "necessary health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children's health and education.
This national program includes daily tooth cleansing from the original fluoride, as well as daily hand washing with soap, taking antimicrobial treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
By mixing soap or detergent in water, microorganisms can be better removed from the skin.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce obstacles in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective skin detector because fat and protein, which are organic soil components, do not easily dissolve in water.
However, the cleaning is provided with sufficient flow of water.
Due to repeated use, solid soap may have bacteria left from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from polluted solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to washing bacteria with a shell.
Nevertheless, according to the CDC, "sapons with remedies containing the liquid soap falling facility on the arms without touching the hands are better."
It has been promoted by emphasis on bacterial soap for the conscious public to health.
Until today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or deterents generates antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosone, which contains a broad list of resistant races of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant races are not produced from antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to humidifier and skin-protecting agents, a comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that acid (acetic acid, askorbic acid, lactic acid), microbially active benzoic acid and other skin-friendly agents (alovera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract) can be as pH regulators.
Comfortable hot water for washing hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
At body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) bacteria grow very quickly.
However, cold, hot than soap water, soap water is more effective to remove soil and bacterial natural oils.
However, contrary to popular assumption, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand detoxifier is a hand hygiene agent with a water-free base.
During the late 1990s and the early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (alcohol-based hand rubs, also known as detoxifying hand rubs or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most of these ispropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, are formulated with carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, such as a curling agent, or glycerin in a liquid or foam, such as a moisturizer.
Mixing Tanu hydrogen-perxide increases antibacterial activity and more. 60 to 95% alcoholic hand sanitizers are effective detoxifers.
Alcohol Rabb Sanitizer destroys bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and poets.
Alcohol Rabb Sanitizer containing 70% alcohol destroys 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibel reduction) and 1 minute after application destroys 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria (4 to 5 log reduction). hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is almost entirely ineffective against the viruses of the Norovirus (or Norwalk) type that are the most common cause of infectious arthritis shots. sufficient hand detergent or alcohol Rabb should be used to completely moisturize or cover both hands.
The front and rear parts of both hands and in the middle and the pores of all fingers are shaved for approximately 30 seconds, unless the fluid, shell or gel is dried.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubbs, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these adhesives is based on their ease of use and rapid destructive activity against microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin unless the formula is mixed with lubricants and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol by mixing glycerin and/or other sweeteners in the formula can be reduced or eliminated.
In clinical trials, the irrigation and drying of the skin was significantly reduced compared to soap or anti-bacterial remnants from the alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing sweetening.
Virally allergic to the ingredients present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The lower tendency to trigger dermatitis, which is more annoying than handwashing with soap and water, has become an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free insects do not clean organic substances by hand, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends much on ingredients and formulation, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the effectiveness after repeated use due to likely progressive adverse skin reactions, consistent and accumulated anti-bacterial activity has been shown after the application of formulations using benjalconium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities can’t buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil alone may be more effective than water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase instead of reducing the spread of the disease.
Like the soap, ash is also a detoxifier because in exposure to water it makes an alkaline fusion.
WHO has recommended sand or sand as an alternative to soap if the soap is not available.
The right handwashing technique recommended by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of disease is the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold flowing water.
Flowing water is recommended because stable water basins can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Make the right amount of soap, including the back part of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes detergents from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more fully when they use soap alone instead of water.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Drying causes friction, which helps to remove detergents from the skin, and more detergents disappear from drying for longer.
Wash well under the flowing water.
Washing the hands in the basin can be damaged again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily reinfected. the most missing areas are below the fingers, arms, the area between the fingers and the nails.
Artificial nails and chips can give shelter to polish microbes.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection.
In developing countries where water and/or soap are not available, a variety of low-cost options can be created to make handwashing convenient if necessary, for example, the use of a hanging shell or water from the shell with suitable pores and/or ash. In conditions of limited water supply (such as school or rural areas in developing countries), water-protection solutions are available, such as "Tippi-Taps"and other low-cost options.
Tipp-Tap is a simple technique in which the wire is used to hang by the wire, and a foot-driven liver to put a small amount of water on the hands and the soap stick.
Efficiently drying hands is an indispensable part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some controversies on the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large amounts of research show that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tishu Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by Paper Towel, hot-air handdryers and state-of-the-art Jet-Air handdryers.
After handwashing and drying with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the fingers and 254% on the fingers.
Drying with Jet-Air Dryer increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the fingers and 15% on the fingers.
After washing hands and drying with paper towel, the total number of bacteria fell by average 76% on the fingers and up to 77% on the fingers. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability of other toilet users and the toilet environment to transcend.
Jet-Air Dryer, which extends air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to fly microorganisms from hands and units and possibly contaminate the toilet environment for other toilet users and to the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spread microorganisms from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towel did not show any significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared with paper towel drying.
Washing hands with hand-projector wipes in the absence of soap and water during the trip is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the discovery of its effectiveness in the prevention of disease in the hospital environment by the Hungarian physician Ignaze Semelvis (1846) the medical hand wash became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when forgotten.
In one study, their use has found a decrease in infection rate.
The hands are medically washed for at least 15 seconds, in which the straw is made using the right amount of soap and water or gel and each part of the hands is roasted.
The fingers of both hands should be trapped in each other.
If there is waste under the nails, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since detergents can stay in water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry by washing with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towel should be used to close the water (and any output door should be opened if necessary).
It protects the hands from being damaged again from those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the health care system is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("cytomals") and prevent them from being transmitted.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, not washing hands in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, with a large number of physicians and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, causing the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple processes could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing standard hand-washing and hand-washing in health care areas.
The documentary guidelines for hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
Whitby was reviewed by another.
If the performance of regulatory compliance is necessary, commercial equipment can measure and certificate the hygiene of the hand.
The World Health Organization has defined "five opportunities" to wash hands:
After contact with blood/body fluid
before the deforestation, and
After the patient’s care. adding detoxifying chemicals to the soap (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) provides the handwashing agent with marking capacity.
Before surgery or in a system in which antibiotic resistant organisms are extremely widespread, such marking capacity may be desirable. To "make" your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a nod that can be activated and closed without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, uninfected to dry the hands after washing, and an uninfected brush and another uninfected means for cleaning under the nails, to clean the wrinkles.
All jewelry should be removed.
In this process, it is usually necessary to wash the arms and neck for 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to shave for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrist should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical coat is worn.
To reduce the spread of pollutants, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of a sick person or to use a hand pollutant.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased over 35%, very little additional benefit was obtained.
By washing hands with simple soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious diseases is more than a quarter than washing with antibacterial soap. By washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 minutes compared to drilling hands with an alcohol-based solution, it was revealed that drilling hands with alcohol reduces bacterial pollution by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But hands-on H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium defisile seeds are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubbs to reduce. measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare systems may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubbs, and staff written and oral reminders.
More research is needed on which of these measures in different health care systems are most effective.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an affordable, necessary means to good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal handwashing practice from the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge.
For example, every private or public toilet in most rural Africa has very few handwashing nodes, even if there are cheap options to build handwashing stations.
However, the low rate of handwashing may also be caused by putting habits instead of being caused by the lack of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
To work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective on increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social promotion campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Method" that encourages schools to take simple, cheap steps to ensure that other hygiene requirements, as well as student handwashing with soap.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the school can go up to one to three stars respectively.
Creating a handwashing station can be part of handwashing campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child death rates.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-building campaign aimed at trying to bring a change in behavior. As a result of the Corona virus epidemic of 2019-20, UNICEF promoted adoption of an emoji of handwashing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the defense from DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting handwashing with soap is much more cost effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two hand hygienic officers in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignace Semelweiss who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English who are the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called myasms.
In the 1980s, food-generated outbreaks and health-related infections motivated the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic raised awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases in many countries.
For example, the posters with "perfect handwashing techniques" were hanged near the handwashing sync in the public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "washing your hands" from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for that thing or to believe in it.
It comes from the Bible’s Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate separated himself from the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with a very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's McBeth, Lady McBeth began obligatoryly washing her hands in an attempt to clean a fictional spoon, which reflects her criminal spirit about the crimes she committed and motivating her husband to commit crime.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or thinking about immoral functions, wash their hands more often than others, and pay more importance to handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thought are less likely to engage in their other “cleaning” supplementary tasks such as volunteering.
Religion recommends handwashing for both purposes of hygiene and symbolic. handwashing without soap water is a part of the symbolic handwashing described in many religions, including Bahá’u’lláh, Hinduism, Tevila and Nathilath Yahyim in Jewish religion, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vazu in Islam. Religion also recommends handwashing to provide hygiene especially after some functions.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religion.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jewishism and Islamism, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of COVID-19 infection spread on the workplace
For the control of the risks of spread of COVID-19 infection on the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there are applications of professional safety and health processes for the control of risks.
The proper control of the risk of disease spread on the workplace depends on the workplace and the work done, which are based on the risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of the individual staff who are at greater risk of having COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk tasks have a minimum of professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic preventive measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory ethics, and regular cleaning and pollution of the work environment.
Intermediate contact risk functions are those for which it is necessary to establish repeated or close contacts with those who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
It includes those employees who have public contact such as schools, a high-population work environment, and some high-middle sales arrangements.
In addition to basic prevention measures, hazard control measures for this group include: transmission from high-performance air filters, use of snow guard, andining personal safety equipment available for that situation if a COVID-19 infected person faces.
OSHA considers that health staff and dead-home staff are at high risk of contact, who are exposed to a COVID-19 infected or suspicious person, and this risk increases and becomes high risk of contact if the COVID-19 staff performs aerosol-generating processes on a COVID-19 infected or suspicious person, or collect or treat samples from them.
Risk controls suitable for these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressure transmission cells and personal safety equipment suitable for work.
There can be many effects of COVID-19 outbreak inside the workplace.
The worker may be absent from work due to being sick, the need to take care of others or the fear of potential contact.
Which goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as less demand time or purchase through delivery or moving-return services), can change the form of trade in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of objects from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparation and response plan for a infectious disease can be used to guide protective tasks.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including the source of risk, the risk factors arising from home and community systems, and the risk factors of individual employees, such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also emphasize the controls necessary to address those risks and random plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of an eruption.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of response to an outbreak include: reducing the transmission between employees, protecting people with a high risk of adverse health complications,ining business operations and minimizing the adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community with business location affects the adopted reactions.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure that is widely used to form a group of hazard controls according to the effectiveness of occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 dangers cannot be eliminated, there are the most effective control engineering control, followed by administrative control and eventually personal security equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related risks without depending on the worker's behavior, and it may be the most affordable solution in implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal safety equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Staff should be selected of all types of PPE based on danger, properly placed (e.g., respiratory), constantly and properly wearing, regularly inspecting,ining and changing according to the need, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or treated in order to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact-risk tasks have minimal professional contacts with people and other colleagues.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: repeated and well washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, providing breathing ethics, tissue and waste characteristics covering cough and scratch, preparing remote or intermediate stairs if necessary, dismissing staff from using other tools and equipment, and regular cleaning and pollution of the work environment.
Fast identification and separation of potential infectious individuals on the workplace is an important step for the safety of staff, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute digestive disease stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever reducing or other symptom-changing drugs, and that the policy of disease vacation is flexible, allowing employees to stay at home for the care of the sick family member, and that the employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, activities with moderate contact risk include those tasks that require repeated or close contact with people within six feet (1.8 meters) whose COVID-19 is not known or suspected to be infected, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission around the business site, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a place with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These include the workers who are in contact with the general public such as school, a high-population-frequency working environment, and some high-risk sales systems. Installing high-performance air filters in engineering controls for this and high-risk groups, increasing traffic rates, installing physical obstacles such as transparent individual plastic snowguard, and installing a drive-three window for customer service, including the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window for the use of a drive-three window.
In this risk group, employees need a viral use of respiratory systems.
If a person becomes sick on an aircraft, appropriate controls for the safety of staff and other passengers include: removing the sick person up to 6 feet from others, appointing a crew member for the service of the sick person and asking the sick person to give a face mask or cover his mouth and nose with tissue when the sick person cough or scratches.
When caring for a sick passenger or touching the body’s liquid or potentially damaged surfaces, the crew should wear used medical gloves, and if the sick passenger has fever, constant cough, or breathing difficulties, it should possibly wear additional personal protective equipment.
To commercial shipping, including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, delay the journey when sick in danger controls and inform the medical center on board and immediately if a person develops fever or other symptoms during boarding on board.
For schools and child care facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in a school building with absolute community transmission.
When there is a minimum to medium community transmission, social distance creation strategies can be implemented, such as regional tours, meetings and other major meetings such as the cancellation of meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, the extension of the distance between tables, the transition of arrival and holiday times, the limitation of unnecessary visitors, and the use of a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as flu.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to strategies for creating social distance. For law enforcement staff doing daily legal activities, the immediate health risk is considered by the CDC as low.
Law enforcement officials who have to contact persons confirmed or suspicious of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal safety equipment.
If close contact occurs during holding, staff should, before re-use their duty belt and equipment, clean and disinfect using domestic cleaning spray or washing machine, and follow standard operating procedures for the resistance and treatment of the PPE used and for the resistance and washing of clothes.
OSHA believes that some health care and home-death staff are in high or too high levels of contact risk.
High exposure risk tasks include providing, assisting, laboratory and medical transport staff, who come into contact with known or suspicious COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risks if carmi perform aerosol-generating processes on known or suspicious patients of COVID-19, collect or handle samples from them.
The processes that generate aerosol include canal trending, curve stimulation processes, bronchoscopy, certain dental processes and tests, or sampling samples from the curve.
High contact risk death-home tasks include people who prepare the bodies of individuals with known or suspicious cases of COVID-19 at their time of death; if they do body tests they become very high contact risk. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include separation cells for known or suspicious patients of COVID-19, including during the processes of generating aerosol.
Specific negative pressure conversion in some health care and dead-home systems may be suitable.
The samples should be treated with biosecurity level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that coming patients, depending on whether they are a suspicious COVID-19 case, be divided into different waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory systems for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspicious patients of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who do the processes of generating aerosols.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 filtering facial respiratory systems or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-examination, training and medical examination.
Other types of respiratory systems can provide more safety and improve the comfort of the carmi. WHO does not recommend coverols, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease instead of being transmitted through physical fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the entrance site.
For those who are collecting, caring or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating processes, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, Gogles face sheet, chongga and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating process is carried out, the surgical mask is replaced with the N95 or FFP2 respiratory system.
Given the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends the use of the same respiratory system without removing during the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, to monitor and coordinate the PPE supply chain, and to disrupt the use of the mask for insecticidal individuals, only to allow those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, to reduce the need for PPE through the use of the same respiratory system without removing during the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, to monitor and coordinate the PPE supply chain, and to deter the use of the mask for insecticidal individuals.

This month there are extraordinary circumstances around us.
The COVID-19 epidemic has made it clear that all human beings in the world are connected and the responsibilities we have to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented to us, but we must know that our best response depends on global equality, mutual cooperation, and community development, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of compassion we have seen among all our colleagues on emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary proof of how many extraordinary people we have been lucky to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to find you all as colleagues that I cannot say in words.
Last week a man shared praise for our work with me.
She reminded me how meaningful it is to get the world toward Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to keep this extremely important resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites active or are a source of our colleagues’ wages or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it is the most needed.
This is a moment in which our work, and the way we do it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and the importance of your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in how we work with us from this coming week.
Changes in our work and times
As Robin said earlier, C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timeline for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate reaction in our thinking on the circumstances that are facing us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to get rid of stress and want to support our mission for a long time.
If you have to break your work, there is nothing wrong in it.
For all staff, contractors, and contractual staff:
Our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the next notification.
We are not declaring holidays - if you are able to work more than the usual hours, the mission needs your help.
However, at this time the world is unexpected, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, bring food, or go to a doctor, your skill is our priority.
We don’t count your time.
If you’re sick, don’t work.
We don’t have to say it, but we’re saying it.
No disease vacation or PTO is needed - just tell your manager and help your team modify calendar and timetable to make sure the main area of work sees no one.
(If you have confirmed that you have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&amp;C Options so that T&amp;C can help you and make sure that the management is given appropriate attention to your situation.)
Workers will receive full wages.
We’ve already said, and we’re again revealing our commitment to fulfill our promises given to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will receive salary on the basis of their common working hours during normal circumstances.
If you’re sick and can’t work, you’ll get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially in such times.
Again, your own care is the most important thing.
We tell you to talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can change according to him.
Some things are considered unfair.
There are things that we cannot stop.
SRE, HR options, trust and security, and grants accumulation teams (one other) perform such extremely important tasks that may require additional cooperation.
We will begin a process with all the departments to evaluate the current objectives and to focus our focus on cooperating with the indispensable things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we all will just focus on the most necessary projects.
As soon as we get down, we will escape the wound later.
After the global epidemic has passed, there is no plan to give us “double time for the bullshit.”
You will no longer be expected to work an extra hour to meet the time limits that have exceeded reality.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will act towards setting new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What will happen with APP (Annual Planning)?
To be adapted to our new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we want to change in time-time to complete our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will give us more time to make a budget, so that employees can give priority to their very important tasks, self-care, and care of loved ones, and those who need to work on a decreased timeline in the next few weeks can be adjusted.
This extension of time-limit will bring a good-specific reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will put our proposals before the Board of Directors next week and once we get confirmed we will inform the representatives and teams about the further steps.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership.
Office position, contact, and cleaning
Last week we found out that our SF-based colleague was probably exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with a lot of caution, we deployed an antiviral cleaning carpenter to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office.
She disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank coming to our floor from the hospital-grade antiviral solution.
The building is implementing its own care-work protocol using products that help the safety of its residents.
We believe that when we return, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC Office is located in a WeWork (WeWork) which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all the staff members located in DC.
Last week our DC Office had adopted a completely remote arrangement in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also a discussion about taking a place in Brooklyn on board.
These discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/distance for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working from home/distance for a long time know that it will need adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to increases of more than one or two hours.
If long sessions are needed, consider sharing them into several days.
Defining meetings clearly, keeping the agenda ready, and send the reading material already.
Create your default video with the help of tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to make live collaboration and combination convenient.
Initiate to make each meeting convenient, monitor a person’s chat for questions and keep the speaker list in mind, and help a person take notes (or take notes with mutual cooperation)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to the Tech Support.
Use your health compensation for alpha.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed tasks.
HR Operations Team is investigating the Webinar-based employment guidance to cooperate in the growth of the work distributed throughout the foundation.
This last week we asked all customers receiving community grants to cancel public programs funded by Wikipedia, such as Adithon, etc. until the WHO announces the end of the global epidemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to fulfill their mutual grant activities, and that no one will be punished for being forced to delay or amend those goals.
This next week we will follow with additional guidance in relation to Wikimania and other regional and topical community conferences.
This obstacle shows a sense of suffering in the entire global community, but also a sense of relief in them with the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikipedia and otherwise.
Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the meta-wiki with the aim of monitoring the effects and providing a place for the community to follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time connecting with each other.
We are together in these circumstances and are present to help as much as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this e-mail on Office Wiki, and all other necessary information about COVID-19.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication from employees living in notably affected countries at this time.
If you have anything to ask about travel, programs, a major workshop, or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please inform CRT and work with it.
We are present to provide assistance as needed and help establish relationships.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to HR International Global Operations Director Brian Judan.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our actions and duties.
Instead, they acknowledge that at this time, our tasks and duties are likely to need to be adapted as we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can act, provide our activities in cooperation with their needs, and continue to provide the service that the world depends on.
When time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Currently, it’s time to help each other, and to create space for important tasks coming in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
To make it possible, we all need you, and therefore we want you all to take care of yours and your families, so that you can be at your best level when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Linet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenny U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the external surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines (cell membranes).
ACE2 balances the activity of the related angiotensin-modifying enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entrance point to cells for some corona viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 is a methloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of the intrasphere and other cells.
ACE2 proteins contain N-terminal peptides M2 domain and C-terminal colectin amino acid conductor domain.
ACE2 is one-bar crossing type I membrane protein with enzymatically active domain on the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The exotic domain of ACE2 is dissolved from the paralytic domain by another enzyme called Shades, and the resulting soluble protein becomes free into the blood flow and eventually emits into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is primarily associated with the cell membrane of pneumonia type II atmospheric cells, small intestinal entrosites, intestinal cells of the arthritis and shora and the soft muscular cells of the arthritis in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA appearance is also found in the cerebral volcano, striathoma, hypothalamus and brain columns.
The primary task of ACE2 is to act as the charge of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I dissolves the hormone into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid fenylenine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and water-decomposes it into vascular angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9] can also dissolve many other peptides, including Bradicine, Apelin, Neurotensin, Dinorphine A and Greelin.
ACE2 indifferent amino acid conductor also controls the membrane transport of SLC6A19 and its role has been in heart disease.
As a carrot protein, ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS generating virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 generating virus) acts as the main entry point in cells for some corona viruses.
More specifically, the connection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of S1 protein involves the transfer of both viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cells and endosomes.
This entry process also requires the inflammation of S protein by nutrient serin proteases TMPRSS2, whose blockade is under current examination as a potential therapy. This is why some people have assumed that lowering the levels of ACE2 in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended the standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy to continue.
In a methodological review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, it was found that “the use of ACE inhibitors compared to the controls was associated with a remarkable reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia.”
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in the death rate associated with pneumonia, although the results were less predominant than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Reconnective human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new medicine for acute lungs damage, and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory crisis syndrome appears to improve fungial hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig babies.
The half-age of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the beginning of action with a 24-hour effect process (period) is 30 minutes.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising medicine for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulatory angiotensin II increases.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications, which are designed to help in 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic response contact tracking, i.e. the identification process of individuals ("contacters") who may be in contact with an infected person.
Many applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the construction of the contact tracking application.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about the systems that are based on the tracking of the geographical location of the app users.
The low-inclusive option includes the use of Bluetooth signals to log the proximity to the other cellphone of a user.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems to support such Bluetooth-based apps.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in the combination of Alipay, allowing citizens to check whether they were in contact with those who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide health authorities with quick responses.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and will be available for planning within weeks. similar app ("StopCovid") has also been deployed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol-based apps. Russia wants to offer a geofensing app for diagnosed patients of COVID-19 living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure that they don’t leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed many potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and potential decrease in effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small portion of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Coronavirus" apps, Apple limited to only "official" or otherwise recognized organizations, determining which types of organizations may include Coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have imposed the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the consequences of mass monitoring using Coronavirus apps, in particular whether the monitoring infrastructure designed to cope with the coronavirus epidemic will be destroyed after this threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement on the limits of such monitoring.
The organizations have declared eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportional";
There should be a closing section for the extent of monitoring and monitoring;
Data use should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided from promoting discrimination and unlawfulness;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens against abuse and to respond to abuse;
"Sensitive participation" will be required by all "related stakeholders", including public health experts and unauthorized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Vedaut Borders (Reporters Oehn Grenaden) (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
The aim of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrelated location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to individual location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use the central server for mutual communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to trace contacts in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from different sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has made the location information publicly available due to long-term changes in information privacy laws after the MERS eruption in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. Many countries including Germany have considered to use centralized and privacy-protection systems.
By April 6, 2020, these details were not yet released.
Privacy-protection contact tracking with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is a established concept. By April 7, more than a dozen experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log close to other mobile phones of a user.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is no one protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, previous contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matchings are on the device.
The Privacy Group in the MIT Media Lab is developing the SafePaths, which is a platform for tracking the spread of COVID-19 to collect and use privacy-protection techniques when collecting or tracking data.
It is based on the research of the White Journal "Apps Gone Rog: Maintenance Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" published in March 2020. the similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, the company that develops privacy technology, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was established by groups that were necessarily organized in the context of the same approach and the same protocols on a large scale, aimed at reducing divisions and enabling the global interactivity of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has open-source BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms controlling companies announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claimed that it will protect privacy based on a combination of low-energy technology and privacy-protection cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques that are used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is expected to be available in three stages:
Official Privacy-Protection Coronavirus Tracking App to provide tools to enable governments to create
Integrate this functionality directly in iOS and Android
The drug reuse (also known as the drug reuse, re-profiling, re-determination or therapeutic change) for which it was originally developed is the reuse of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from that.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and health-related plasma adhesions. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides an appropriate project to develop effective antiviral drugs for protection from COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papen-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymeres, helicazes, S protein and ADP ribofosphate.
Hussain and others studied several candidate compounds, which then optimized and analyzed for the similarity of their cluster with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 anti-medicine in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chlorocvin is an anti-malaria drug that is also used to protect against some self-defense diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorocvin and related hydroxyclorocvin will be one of the four drugs to be studied as part of the solidity clinical test.
New York Governor Andrew Qumo announced that the New York State's testing of chlorocvin and hydroxyclorocvin will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxyclorocvin sulfate and chlorocvile phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trials process and it is authorized as a experimental treatment for emergency use in patients only under the EUA who are hospitalized but are unable to obtain treatment in clinical trials.
CDC said that "the use, dosage or period of hydroxyclorocin for pathogenic prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the medicine when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is doing a short study on the use of chlorocin in a combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
The Duke University and Oxford University are undergoing major studies.
NYU Langon Medical School is testing the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxyclorocin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Fevipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen 35 patients received a negative test in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received Fevipiravir and half obtained Omefenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very small and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it will buy drugs from Japan for its warehouses, and will use the army to deliver drugs to university hospitals, where the drug will be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A combination of antiviral Lopinavir and Ritonavir, a study of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Calatra), concluded that “no benefits were seen”.
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from reproducing by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protection of SARS-CoV-2. within the scientific community there are criticisms about directing resources for the re-use of drugs that are developed especially for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the international solidity test.
Remedevir was produced and developed by Gilliad Sciences as a treatment for Ebola viral diseases and Marburg viral infections. Gilliad Sciences later discovered that Remedevir had artificial environmental antiviral activity to protect from many philo-, neumo-, paramico- and corona viruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe diseases and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies show that remdesvirus may have a high genetic obstacle to resistance. Many clinical tests are ongoing, including two tests operated by the University Hospital of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intramuscular vitamin C for hospitalized and seriously ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic agithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for a end for asthma, for patients with pre-stage symptoms of appearance infected with Novel Coronavirus, Tygins Alvesco (Siclesodine).

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammatory and fungal complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms, who do not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
A number of screenshots are being tested in Italy.
Hyperin with low nuclear load is being widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-centric study on 300 patients who studied the use of anoxaparin sodium on pathogenic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention has been focused on the re-use of approved antiviral drugs, which have been developed for former outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Rebavirin: Rebavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th version guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Chinese 7th version guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potential reuse as COVID-19 treatments:
Tosilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Testing also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a prescribed vaccine for protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of vaccination for protection from SARS-CoV-2, disease-generating virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major eruption spread around the world in 2020, resulting in considerable investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genoms to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
As in April, the obligations of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, production capacity, mass planning and global advance.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms were undergoing research and development during the start of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
Phase I Security Studies include advanced key platform targets:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (step I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (step I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to Milken Institute 79), and 37 others have been announced, but less public information is available (designed or predicted in planning).
In one phase I-II testing, early safety and immunity tests are carried out, it is usually done on random, placebo-controlled and multiple locations, determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III tests typically include more participants, with a control group monitoring the adverse effects on the optimal dose, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of disease.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not in human assessment (they were still in "pre-clinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it is examining the ability of a molecular clamp vaccine, which will genetically modify the viral protein to stimulate immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccination Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of the work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced on January 26, 2020 at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and on January 28, 2020 at the University of Hong Kong.
Around January 29, 2020, Jansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Haneke SchuteMaker, announced that it has started working on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing a oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaksart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership to develop vaccines with Vacart.
On February 8, 2020, the Laboratory Oncogen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technique used for cancer neontagens vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the Research Institute announced that he has finished the synthesis of the vaccine and is starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, Nurex Immuno-Oncology announced that they are starting a vaccine project to create a Le-Ky peptide vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans "in 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced that they are working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and construction of vaccines.
We will work together with Novak.
Partners announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 vaccines, and that it will take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine even on a fast step.
On March 12, 2020 a biotechnology company in Quebec City in Quebec the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial financing from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human testing for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, the Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Kurwak a "big amount for special acquisition of COVID-19 vaccines" against which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Fizer announced a partnership with the German company Biontec to develop mRNA-based vaccines.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in pre-clinical testing, whose clinical testing is expected to start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that they will have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate may be tested up to a decade.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Prepaidness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including the Institute of Pasteur, Themes Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, which makes a total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 Vaccine Development $29 million.
Other CEPI’s investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Modern, Curva, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have launched the animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers from the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-developed RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million in financing for 96 research projects on medical measures for safety from COVID-19, including many vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost at the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "Tika bank" of several new vaccines that could be used when other coronavirus eruptions occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc test in mice, saying that "MNA-served SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have triggered antigen-specific antibody reactions [in mice], which became clear to begin 2 weeks after vaccination."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasica spray.
Using bacteriophage, DNA will be designed to reproduce inside human bacteria to produce damaged viral-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities deposited resources for acquisition from IBM to supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have toxic effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have additional benefits from the disease they prevent.
Another random test in Australia requires 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate preliminary research assessing the effectiveness of vaccines, the need for bio-security level 3 resistance measures to cope with living viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety processes.
Non-human animal models have tested vaccines for protection from SARS and MERS.
By 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research letters published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful hole to develop vaccines and treatments for protection from MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and a MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other races of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, smell sensation damage and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are light in most cases, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-angular failure develop.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are healed. the virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, through small drops generated by cough, scratching or talking.
Although these drops occur when breathing out, they usually fall on the ground or surfaces instead of being infected at a long distance.
People can also be infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for 72 hours.
This is the most infectious during the first three days after the beginning of symptoms, although transmission can be possible before and in the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a phase of infection.
It is recommended to use the mask for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public are different, some authorities recommend not using them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be isolated or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty awakening and blueness of the face or lips; urgent medical care is recommended when these symptoms occur.
Less generally, symptoms of the upper respiratory path can be seen such as swelling, nasal flow or throat pain.
Symptoms of stomach such as mucousness, vomiting and diarrhea are seen in different percentages.
In some cases in China, at the beginning only swelling and sharp blowing of the chest was seen.
In some cases, the disease can increase to pneumonia, multi-angular failure and death.
It is called an outstanding period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of individuals developing symptoms, symptoms develop within 11.5 days of the infection. reports indicate that symptoms aren’t developed in all reduced individuals.
The role of these isolating carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, initial evidence shows that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The ratio of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, about which the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has that 20% of all confirmed cases remained insecticide during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include isolatory cases in its daily cases on 1 April; 130 (78%) of 166 infections were isolated during the test.
Bells and larva can be large amounts of virals in both.
Speaking in a high voice makes more drops out than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that no-covered cough can produce drops that range up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is not generally ventilated, the National Academy of Sciences has that bioairosol transmission could be possible and samples from air collectors involved in the corridors outside people's rooms came positive to viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as canal inclination and cardiovascular therapy (CPR) can result in aerosols from respiratory excretion and thus can be a respiratory spread.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the outbreak, this risk is considered low. This virus is most infectious when people are targeted; although it is possible to spread before the symptoms appear, but its risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other individuals.
Specifically, the virus was found detectable for a day on the grass, for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and for four hours on 99% copper.
Still, it varies depending on moisture and temperature.
If properly used, soap and decayers are also effective; soap products deactivate them by dissolving the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as releasing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benjalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical detoxifier), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, lary samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest amount of viral, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of viral on the second day of the test.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first separated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronavirus related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is related to the intimity of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the viral enzyme reaches nutrient cells through angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in pneumonic type II atmospheric cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "containers" (pephlomers) to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
In hospital in Wuhan, China, 12% of infected people found severe heart damage and this is more common in severe illness.
During the progression of the disease, the rates of cardiovascular symptoms caused by oral transmitter reaction and disorders of the immune system are high, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 clients in the heart.
ACE2 grey are extremely manifest in the heart and are involved in the work of the heart.
In ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, a high prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found, which could be associated with poor disease diagnosis. In body examinations of people who died from COVID-19 were found peripheral respiratory damage (DAD) and lymphosite-added external substances within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a follow-up for respiratory path ACE2-representative subcells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of oral overdose.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-sorbent T-cells were shown to be associated with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-sorbent monocytes in COVID-19 patients and serious lung diseases.
Lymphocytic external substances are also in the body examination.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal foam; however, a nasopharyngeal foam or mucus sample can also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they need to take two blood samples within a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is lower.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus spectrum and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infection by the virus.
By April 4, 2020, antibodies were in development (which could detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with tests has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care-to-site test for use at the end of that month on 21 March 2020. Clinical guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan showed how to detect the infection based on clinical facilities and epidemic risk.
In the early transition, bilateral multidisciplinary ground-glass uncertainty with a peripheral, untouched and post-distribution is common.
When the disease grows, subplural dominations, crazy pewing (the thickness of folded walls with variable atmospheric filling) and density can appear.
Very subtle injuries and diseases of COVID-19 are available with fewer statistics about body action.
The main pathological findings obtained from the body exam are:
Macroscopy: Shooth, pericarditis, pneumonia and pneumonia in the fuse cover
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Light pneumonia: Fumphusic shuffs, neumocytes overwhelming, large unparuropic neumocytes, intramuscular inflammation with lymphocytes and multi-centric enormous cell building
severe pneumonia: severe respiratory damage (DAD) with extinct respiratory discharge.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS) and severe low-oxygenicity.
Treatment of pneumonia: Treatment of eruptions and infusive intracellulity in atmospheric caves
Blood: transmitted intravenous scanning (DIC); lucoarithroblastic manifestation
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, repeatedly and for at least 20 seconds washing hands with soap and water,ining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or scratching and recommends using the inside part of the neck if the tissue is not available.
Suitable hygiene of the hand is encouraged after cough or scratch.
The CDC has recommended the use of face-covered clothes in public arrangements to limit the transmission by partially illusive individuals. The social distance strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workshops, prohibiting travel and canceling large public celebrations.
The guidelines for making distances also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since vaccination is not expected at least by 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is trying to reduce the extreme of the epidemic, which is called "reducing the curve".
CDC also recommends that a person wash his hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when his hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying, coughing or scratching his nose.
In addition, it recommends using at least 60% alcohol-based hand-projects, but only when soap and water are not easily available. A area where professional hand-projects are not easily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial action is derived from ethanol or isopropenol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial seeds in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand-protection."
Glycerol is mixed as a moisturizer.
People are managed with assistant care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen aid and other important organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extra-corporal amber oxidation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assistant treatment may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intecists and palmonologists in the United States have compiled recommendations for treatment from various agencies in a free source, IBCC.
By April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acitaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of the transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when aerosol-generating processes such as a canal penetration or aesthetic transmission are carried out.
For health staff care of individuals infected with COVID-19, CDC recommends that the person, in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-free precautions, be placed in an air-free infection separation cell (AIIR). CDC prepares a framework of guidelines for the use of personal safety equipment (PPE) during epidemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE chongga, respiratory or face mask, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respiratory systems (instead of face mask) are given priority.
N95 respiratory systems are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized the mask for use under the Emergency Experiment Authority (EUA).
They are designed to protect against non-airing particles such as dust, but the effectiveness to a specific biological indicator is not promising for non-approved experiments.
When the mask is not available, CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a final remedy, home-made mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so serious that they require mechanical conversion or other options, but in some percentage cases it is necessary.
The type of respiratory aid for persons with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized persons, with some evidence that high flow can be avoided from nodular inclination with nasal entrance or bilateral positive respiratory pressure.
Whether any of these two offers the same benefits to seriously sick people is unknown.
Some physicians prefer to use entrance mechanical transmission when available because this technology limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal entrance. Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of a health system to cope with the sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases that make hospitalization necessary.
A study in China found that 5% were recruited in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for conversion, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized people with COVID-19 have finally been recruited to the ICU.
Mechanical transmission becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and it becomes more difficult to provide oxygen.
Pressure control systems and ventilators capable in high PEEP are required to maximize oxygen distribution while reducing the risk of pneumothorax damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedevers seem to be the most hopeful.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
People with severe illness can be tried to give antiviral medication.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily permitted health-beneficial plasma as experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is serious or immediate threat.
No necessary clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of this disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by using monitoring data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also warns local health officials. big data analyses for cellphone data, face-identification technology, mobile phone follow-up and artificial intelligence are used to follow infected people and those with whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to accompany the mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
This measure was made to implement quarantine and to protect people who come in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020 Deutsche Telekom shared telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Coach Institute for the prevention of the spread of the virus and research.
Russia has used face identification technology to detect those who violate the quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are somehow moving."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kalzulad, called for a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience a crisis due to quarantine, travel ban, side effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
According to Rory O'Connor, "the growing social separation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economic recession are an ideal storm that damages people's mental health and skills."
This disease may have a mild process with or without some symptoms similar to common swelling, such as other common upper respiratory diseases.
Light cases usually get healed within two weeks, while cases with severe or excessive diseases may take three to six weeks to get healed.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a high risk of serious infection with COVID-19, but there is a reduction in statistics for COVID-19.
In the most seriously affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, capital trauma or multi-angular failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include impotence, abnormal scanning and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scanning abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while in 4% of this group, abnormal kidney function is observed.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the beginning of the symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average time from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
The tissue pathology tests of body-examination lung samples show exhausted atmospheric damage with cosic fibromycoside leaks in both the lungs.
The cell pathology changes that occurred from virals in the neumocytes were seen.
The pulmonary picture appeared similar to the acute respiratory crisis syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noticed by high levels of troponin or heart rate stop.
According to the U.S. March statistics, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-study conditions. the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation of a region can also affect the mortality rate.
The estimated mortality rate varies from situation to situation due to those regional differences and also due to system-related difficulties.
Due to the low calculation of light cases, the death rate can be estimated higher.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous cases may mean that the current mortality rate is estimated to be lower.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people healed from the disease, and lung scans expressed organ damage.
It can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after healing.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people healing from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of positive tests for coronavirus have been on the date after healing with COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse than a recurred infection.
The virus is considered a animal origin that spreads through the transition from natural and animal to human.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the transmission of the infection occurred almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the first date of symptoms started was 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications the first start of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Many measures are usually used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers continue to vary according to area and time and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time passing from early eruptions and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO determined the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemically without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory.
According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality ratio by 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and infection death rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected people dying from a disease (diagnosed and not diagnosed).
These data are not timely and follow a specific population from the infection to the recovery of the case.
Although not all infected people develop immune, the appearance of the immune can get information about how many people have been infected.
In the center of the eruption in Italy, Castiglion de'Ada, in a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In the gang, this disease was spread by carnival festivals and young people, reducing the relative mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, according to estimates from blood donors, approximately 3% can be immune.
COVID-19 has confirmed the deaths of 69 (0.004% of the population).
The effects of epidemic and its mortality rates vary for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have a higher mortality rate among men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is reduced only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, the low prevalence of smoking in women and the development of congenital conditions in men such as high blood pressure in younger ages than women can contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those dying from COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government will not monitor gender-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to get exposed to their viruses.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
The head of the WHO, Tedros Adenom Gabrielus, said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified, i.e. December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a specific geographical location (such as China), references of species of animals or groups of people, which are in accordance with international recommendations for nomination in order to prevent insulting. the virus generating COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are generally referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial eruption in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were generally called "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as temporary names for viruses and diseases of acute respiratory diseases, which comply with the 2015 guidelines of not using places in diseases and viruses names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limits in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as NASICA FAH and ventilator.
In one example, when an Italian hospital immediately needed a ventilated valve, and the supplier was unable to provide in the required time-limit, a local startup printed the required 100 valves throughout the night by reverse engineering.
After the early outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, false information and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and rapidly spread online.
Man seems capable of spreading viruses into some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral reproduction in pigs, cattle, and chickens.
No medications or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most hopeful effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The previous task on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 gray to enter human cells.
Three screening strategies are being checked.
First of all, the researchers’ goal is to build a whole virus vaccine.
The purpose of the use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subjective vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some subparts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on S-contained protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme gray.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique of making vaccine).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness on 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine is a harmless genetic code copied by the virus that causes disease. Antibody-dependent growth has been to be a potential challenge for the development of the vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted by April 2020.
Seven tests were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxyclorocvin or chlorocvin.
Planned to be informed by the end of April, with nine phase III tests on Remedeciver in many countries, most Chinese research is working on re-useable antiviral drugs.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical candidates was ongoing. Many existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remadeciver, chlorokin and hydroxyclorokin, lokinavir/retonavir and interferon beta combined lokinavir/retonavir.
By March 2020, experimental evidence for the effectiveness of Remedevir is available.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remedevir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorocvin already used for the treatment of malaria was studied with initial results in China in February 2020.
However, the corresponding review of the research has been called for.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of a gram noted that twice as much dosage is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permission for use of hydroxyclorocin and chlorocin at the discretion of the physicians who treat people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th version guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Early statistics indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the intestine of artificial environmental SARS-CoV-2.
The studies have shown that the preliminary compound protein priming by transmembrane protein serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by end:process with ACE2 gray.
The main boundaries of the studies of chlorocvin and hydroxyclorocvin with or without ezithromycin have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oslemivir does not inhibit artificial environmental SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Increase in cytokine levels in subsequent stages of severe COVID-19 may be a complication.
There is proof that hydroxyclorocin may have anti-citocin levels increase properties.Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a short study has been completed.
It is passing the phase 2 non-race test at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
In conjunction with serum feritin blood test to identify the increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to face such increases, which are considered to cause death in some affected people.
Interlucin-6 anti-gray in 2017, for a different reason, was approved by the FDA on the basis of preconditional case studies for the treatment of the steroid disruptive cytokine discharge syndrome caused by CAR T cell medicine.
So far, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tosilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated immunities produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being examined as a non-tyc method of pastive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with unreasonable results.
Viral indifference is an expected action, by which passive antibody therapy can mediate in safety from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other activities, such as antibody-dependent cosial cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of pasive antibody therapy, for example, the use of manufactured monoclonal immunities, are in development.
The health-beneficial serum, which contains a liquid portion of the blood of healed patients and contains immunities specific to this virus, can be increased to rapid planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of symptoms related to intimity
Lee Wenliang, a physician at the central hospital of Wuhan, was infected with COVID-19 after increasing awareness of the spread of the virus and died.
