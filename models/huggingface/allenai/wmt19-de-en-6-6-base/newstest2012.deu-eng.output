No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to accept an amendment to the Criminal Code to abolish those paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the detainees, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request to alleviate penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly adverse agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final and the verdict is due to be heard before the court in December.
Timoshenko himself called the verdict political revenge of the regime, and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of prejudice of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the prime minister was sentenced, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been necessary for his acceptance.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the customary law of Sharīʿa, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because in short, theft would be hacked.
Women, too, should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Koran will unify society from the tribes that command each other.
In short - an order will prevail in Libya, which would hardly be conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans variety.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Moslem fighters could even be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apologies may serve only the fact that NATO ’ s air strikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West does not belong to them.
We only took part in a shooting, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to look after a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the deceased are concerned - the expulsion of the crusaders.
Will the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a mockery price without occupation?
It is hardly possible, and so the West can at last rightly boast its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not spoil the Sharīʿa ’ s representatives.
The beginning of a new crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a static storm burst through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increased.
Today, however, the obligation market is tearing all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany ’ s GDP grew by 0.5%, from France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had originally been expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France acknowledged a slight decline by 0.1% (original figures only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year ’ s third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated, and according to Tsch. Statistical office, this confirmed the trend of slowing economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year ’ s third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal estimates, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts ’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds is 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The selection of football has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well laid out gate Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1: 0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won very happy 1: 0 thanks to the lack of completion of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football championship.
They were also able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half because of the precise defence game of the Czech team.
The chickens of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be part of the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a premium of approx. 200 million will be awarded to local football.
From the first few minutes on, quite militant football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide reductions in front of the penalty box were successfully defended by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ’ s core program.
They made a living shield.
A few hundred university students made a living shield around a kernobject in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country ’ s core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon in front of the object and then announced their death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran made a lively sign around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to know that they are prepared to protect their country ’ s core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since given up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the USA and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, the Israeli nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan ’ s target would also be the center in Isfahan if an attempt was made to paralyze Iran ’ s nuclear program as much as possible.
The menu of a fatty child: It does not breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have obesity problems, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the milieu in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him is for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are on the table up to half more often than in families with normal children.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the day before the reconnaissance campaign under the motto "Obesity is not a coincidence" French fries for dinner.
In families with thickets, sport is not exactly one of the favourite occupations, however, which also affects the majority of today's pupils - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active exercise.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the Allgemeine Krankenkasse and the Gesellschaft Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from the 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, said, five times a day to eat breakfast in the mode of second breakfast, lunch and dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet", is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that also relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils ’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone will have breakfast on their own.
The worst thing was the finding that in every tenth family is not carved at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are doing sports, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Get your own menu together
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, the pasta was just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get proper information.
"The results of the project indicate that the control group of those involved in the survey, who completed the questionnaire following the conclusion of the explanatory lecture" Obesity is not a coincidence ", has in many cases seen a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition."
This was remarkable, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had tasted a bit that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
There I did not know in the least what is still coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" runs.
It will be even worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And that is most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to optically conceal broad shoulders, to extend the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - in a nice and figurative way, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really does not fit, you should at least have a piece cut to size.
You will certainly not regret that, because well-seated clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the bars that is always too high and slippery, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, belly, applications, embroidery or refining.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do it in the face of the homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity for whom she should design suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the respective star and its figurative type.
I shall "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I cheer, because this is much better for me personally than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera to attract, which has increased in recent times probably to the hundred kilos (well, that is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the internet, print them and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was shortened by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And skillful stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is called variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Playing with it," he stressed.
But the following advice was most important to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally I realize why we have to break all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see everything else in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný confirmed that image and styl sometimes make up half of the success.
You just need Madonna to look at a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if someone can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to find out with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the respective celebrity is back to or away, etc.
On Sunday Jan and Mario advised us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must first of all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Assess people without offering themselves and standing by his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clean up the whole wardrobe and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "space bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which one buttons at the waist and in which one carries all necessary propriets with him.
Apart from such clear things, such as scissors, scissors to remove hair or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (thus the stylist helps photographing products, such as handbags or hats off), special clips, with which the clothing is rubbed at the back, if it is too big (pins or other clamps are forbidden, so that the fabric does not break down) and of course sewing tools.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We o glue and glue...
With scissors it is not even possible to touch shoes so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to act cleverly.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - dedicating oneself to styling on a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic errors for routine travel to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, what use is this already, if obviously nobody had desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the counter, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" awakened high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" to a new dimension again, and in the exemplary demonstration examples, he actually did not seem to be just one of many action championship racing games.
We were also curious about how the adapted passages fail, in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you had expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade rounds, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it is actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, history is introduced, the main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, one sits on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One has no moment the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing moving about the world.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn scenery or high up through deeply snow-covered landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Every now and then untypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely limits the visibility.
In the mountains you have to be hellish, that you are not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And in addition the police interferes, which wants to massacre the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game there are much less such passages than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
Ultimately, this is more for the benefit of the matter, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, that it does not tear out trees, but on the other hand one could not claim that it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But action-packed racing continues to do justice to the local driving model, although the competition could be better.
Until then, everything is in best order.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you close overtaking or passing oncoming cars, you "strip" the other cars only lightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the spin and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the cart goes straight to scrap.
Thanks to the rest of the system, it doesn ’ t matter, it ’ s annoying.
The rest arts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five rests.
If you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front..
So the residual arts are rather something like an auxiliary, in the case that something does not succeed, but one should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the rest of the species helps, since nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
Speaking unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, in the corresponding place, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, no matter whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you can see that the opponent passes two oncoming cars in front of a game, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you arrive there, everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without regard to the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in opposite direction.
The opponent must overtake one here obviously on devil coming out.
And if he is in front of you, then he takes the view of course, so that you can drive your own car a few times there.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly forgets the joy of the game.
And this is a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and in places also so action-packed that one almost no longer knows where one stands the head.
And basically it doesn't matter what is "to blame" - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars in the course of the races.
One must not overlook the gas stations at the track, because it is precisely here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that one has just.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic supercars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of game history also goes the task of the game mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations, which one knows from the history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for the own profile to win, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different items must be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously associated with the online autolog function, which among other things compares the results obtained with those of other players and ensures further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into an U Bahn tunnel (for my sake), where you rest in the dark on the tracks long (for me).
On the speedometer numbers look between 150 a 200 km / h (my way), but there comes at once from behind an underground train and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editors we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
This makes it all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This concerns, in particular, accidents involving a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address a wide and only possible scale of rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá was created "by everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? Feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned above, we could have argued with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eyes sting.
Concert of "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the combination of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this with music experience.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions out of place."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn out. "
"It will take five or six years for the waves to be smoothed and everyone will have become accustomed to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, very keenly speaking at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture she showed how seriously she takes the slogan "comprehensible and open about Europe", in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and comprehensible way that she could have envy many of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism was made loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray civil servant who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath, how well he took care of the matter.
"He is a person who is able to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, who has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? Which number should I call? ", that is, as an important step towards the unification and better legibility of the EU's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil cap quargel
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And we still have to approve the EU ’ s seven year budget, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today ’ s economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which economic sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandably about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it is greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, actually know whether we really are crooked in Brussels or think about round cucumbers and various large bananas, or whether someone really wants to ban us from quarrying?
It would also have liked to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman says next to me:" Hey, what do you put the heads together - is that your V4 again? "and at the same time makes a pretty sour face.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects, above all, tough rules for the Member States' budget policy.
It is much more real than a 'European federation' and it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," said Vicenová.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues must be discussed by all member states, not just eurozone countries, with an impact on the whole EU.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes the strategy of IBM most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, and it is known as a modern company, although a century has elapsed since its founding.
The basis for this longevity was laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen. more
He already advocated the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark to which the life of the future giant was to take place (and at the same time the title of the company-internal magazine, which was already published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen ’ s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for an entire century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
In the course of our first century, this allowed us to transform technologies, business and also society.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Permeated system
Watson had social care for his employees already in the 1930s - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM's people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
The long-term relationships between IBM and its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion right from the start - as one of the first companies in the world IBM lifted all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, which Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
This has been part of IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years IBM has made so-called online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting and Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasises, it is a difference to be present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of family called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
IBM owns the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the floppy disk.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock market value (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company (right after Apple) this year, with Microsoft overtaking for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its foundations on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who basically stands and falls with his operating system Windows.
Successful technologies
To a large extent, IBM ’ s profits involve services, software and hardware to one fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing future-oriented technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
To date, IBM seems to survive today ’ s crisis without prejudice.
Since 2008, the value of IBM ’ s shares has increased by 120 percent like raketen-like and the company ’ s net profit is growing continuously.
The corporate slogan of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
This is another reason why we can expect this flexible giant to overcome the next crisis.
IBM – History: From Cheese Cutter to Universal Flights
IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was about a brand name for a branch office in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous engraved card clocks to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even overshadowed the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas until today the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began to manufacture and distribute all kinds of machinery for the trade - from sausages and cheese-makers to cheeses.
In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers from IBM helped NASA to direct flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System / 360.
A classic PC defining the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consulting section of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a top team of global researchers who deal with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová gave refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably wouldn ’ t have even come up with a dream of her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth to Říčany after 30 days at her urging, Josef went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved them.
With time Darina resigned, yes it seemed even as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář does not care with whom his wife sleeps
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová betrayed; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him is something Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, that doesn't change."
"My wife wants a paper on marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek a new love, he does not want to prevent it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take on any responsibility.
The worst female virtues: What about you?
When men are asked to call some typical female virtues, they shake out some of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we review a few undesires that make the blood fall in the veins of men?
Shopping addiction
Do you think you were merciful?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of money a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it also be a bit more with promotions?
Then, in your case, it is a real weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping pleasure under control.
But hand to the heart, which woman already keeps it out, in search of a well-seated outerwear only in such a way to stroll through a clothes shop and not to try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often the pure hell for men.
Think about how many times they have told her husband - stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Did I ever find you?"
Is that somehow known to them?
Yes?
Then you are probably one of the women who are literally obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let yourself go, but many men react allergic when their wife constantly mourns over her appearance.
The stronger sex is united - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Are you scolding with your partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, do you scolding the children, because the sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room wardrobe has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not in the first place.
This excessive purity mould can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stitching
"Dirty pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks tomorrow again?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you may not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, this is not meant badly, they just want everything that has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have to taste so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women clap and gossip gladly, there is tucked behind the back or even slandered or one forges alliances.
Women are now once focused on relationships, therefore they like to howl through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossip tanks of coarsest calibers, to which nothing and no one is sacred, which despise probably everyone in their surroundings and which represent a considerable danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
The ice hockey winger Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia ’ s 5-3 victory on the ice in Carolina in the NHL ’ s Monday game with two assists, and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the thirty-nine year old ice hockey star ’ s overview was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant in both cases and was proclaimed the best player in the match.
Two wizards in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
After the game Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a big evening.
"Even before the game, I tell him that he manages a hat trick today."
I somehow felt that. "
"Every now and then you get such a feeling," explained Jágr, after Giroux's action scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later also the second hit had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the start of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short Hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I would not have imagined in life that I would play together with such an hockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"I am very happy about that."
"I cut my game to me."
“All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the spit turns, ” smiled Jágr.
Carolina made game yet to the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and am glad that it worked out," Voráček described the last match hit from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia took the lead of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček violated Buffalo in the game and retired in the second third because of injury to the torso.
The Candiens lost not only their experienced Beck but also their leadership an unlost in the Penalty shootout 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of the fines.
More than the lost points the coach of the home team probably suffered the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defensive players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only ended the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do with it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change one attack wave after the other and we had nothing to oppose."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold mainly only journeys to the socialist countries of the East, while at that time only those who were chosen were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia embarked on a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (that is, Czechoslovakia) were allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a ČSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Back then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then they had to buy huge snakes or stay overnight in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not yet gone.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a departure to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial means (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and data - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While by 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the nineties of the last century the foreign exchange obligation to the neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park while travelling to Paris, because who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
At that time, a typical feature of Czechs' journeys abroad was a trunk packed with canned goods, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of living, and thus the average salaries, rose, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips by charter flights, whereby the air travel thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts, in comparison to the past unbelievably discounted.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, had already unpaid payments with all the advanced countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel was in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - Thailand - thanks to the high demand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are served directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished visa requirements for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the cost at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a patent threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman, threatening that Ivan Hašek ’ s successor will not be known at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there is still no agreement on which electoral order is to be elected.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old squabbles broke out again between the two chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Popular House in the Smíchov district of Prague for free, because the hearing did not produce any results, and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with an authorisation.
On this only point, agreement was reached at least in part, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose view that representation on a authoritative basis was not permissible.
However, the electoral disputes continue.
The Executive Committee, too, did not bring any more clarity into the matter, in its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patent situation?
Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management, said: "The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model."
According to the statutory model, in the third round the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the board for which he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly prepared to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the Moravian side's objections, which would find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
It is surprising that Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it is clear that the statutory electoral system is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that as much as possible be elected according to the statutes."
"In order not to devise any nonsensical alternatives, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"When football first rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to" rectify "the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides does not remain.
Some negotiations should supposedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance and so one searched feverishly for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee nevertheless still to the place of the Barrage.
Finally, the ministerial meeting, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is probably crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked the divided parties within the country ’ s largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of ČSTV, which is to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, head of the Pilsner football team, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have allowed himself to fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, then I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the role of Chairman only for a year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too much entangled in football.
"I spoke personally to some people in question."
"Hardly to believe that some people told me that they did not want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Federation Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for Pelta to hold the position of Chairman.
"In his victory today's condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interception for investigation in a corruption saffaire, from which Pelta emerged without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (German) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said řekl Paclík, who sees his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already somewhat more relaxed.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended with a fiasco, also thinks.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he is able to manage the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who caused a sensation in September that he was at the head of the convocation of the Arbitration Commission with Luďěk Macela, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims that he has grown in the role of the chairman of the association.
And he refers to his abilities in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into repugnant situations," Paclík said, who does not make a meal out of his antipathy to the Sparta head Daniel Křetínský, for example.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would praise the political leaders for making more money flow from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"If the taxation of gambling comes, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they must also say in a clear way where the money goes," he said.
Paclík does not see his connection with the Pilsner Club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "impartial".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not exactly ideal."
"In my opinion, however, it does not make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club hypocritically to a third person in order to return after a year and a half", Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would exclude a patent situation in the future.
Two days before the football association ’ s Annual General Meeting, one of the candidates for the Chair ’ s Office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, in the event of his election, he would make a strong case for the FAČR to be given new statutes which, in future, will exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday trial in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so he liked the two-month break to defend his ideas about the direction of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria prevailing at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today ’ s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September ", Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Civil Association that he used as a means of attracting the delegates.
"Should I become a chairman, then I personally accept it and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not attempt to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had already announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opposing candidate would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already point to some successes. "
"His attacks, however, were diminishing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Also for this reason, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the monkeys - from the Causa Bohemians to the post-halls of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the forty-six year old candidate, ČTK, two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the dire catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only contentious point should be how to vote in the third round, then we will get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and he only wins it if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, many people in the association allegedly would lose their spirits.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce changes to the system and to hold the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work begun by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to competitive football for the youth. "
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything on my own," said Rajchl in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member dedicates himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute tough tasks so that football can advance in every segment with milestones. "
Many would not be delighted about it, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to stand at all.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, who do not always throw a stick between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me, however, that I should not give up because otherwise others would do it."
"This is trust that you must not lose," he said.
He is also allegedly motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Processes have been initiated, which will only be valid in a few years' time, and I would be reluctant to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - were elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football in such a way that it would only be there for the elect."
I may be accused of some, but not of being partisan. "
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the elect," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then ascended to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia", says Rajchl.
Because now also the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also regards the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames the association for not pulling in a single strand.
While he says from Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to regain confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue with the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and he would obviously not change the personnel occupation in the commissions in principle."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor, ” Rajchl judges over his rival.
Europe ’ s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Splash pool in Ufo's optics, splendid pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one of her luggage was not missing: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam marble to Putten, who waited for her on the edge of the pool, and marveled over meticulously restored Art Nouveau floating halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - including interesting details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore's concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 year-old German is a true bathing culture.
She doesn't have much to do with sport, says Meder - only in water is that different.
It is only annoying that swimming fans have to find their way away with blue tiles and chlorine stank, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashes in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the spa factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have given themselves trouble, swimming halls can be a real delight: "Instead of a floor one has a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Spa in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc and Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the bustle on the ski piste.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a ufo just reached in the Alps.
From three bowls open upwards it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly after heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen carbonate containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you can slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder threw a glance through the weathered windows of the red-white-and-white Art Nouveau building, she saw weed growing between the tiles.
In contrast, one has counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases have already passed this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements, which date back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite swimming pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally came from the Black Forest.
"It is already a performance to merge so different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only secondary.
Agrar Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets Raw Materials illuminate business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to Mirror ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world ’ s poor.
In January, the CEO will then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of Germany, the matter is clear: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate on commodities such as wheat or maize using agricultural commodities.
Two thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world ’ s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges raise prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is specifically directed against Deutsche Commerzbank Bank ’ s CEO Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Initially, commodity bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US rivals, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was worth "putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even a complete departure.
Ackermann crafts his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks are now damaging the general good."
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the top banking lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for bets on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr Ackermann is talking about people suffering from hunger or about Deutsche Bank's reputation."
The insight of Ackermann comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not switch to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial aggrar speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses he hardly needs to shrink - that would ultimately have to do with his successor.
Every second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization ’ s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore only eleven per cent that Deutsche Bank offers investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 per cent indicated to think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21er House in Vienna
The Removed Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ends: the Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and closed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition hall.
When modern post-war architecture is warmed by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
Schwanzers Pavillon was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria ’ s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
In 1973 he finally became internationally famous with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus an ingenious auxiliary building in Munich.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected, rebuilt after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Southern Railway Station and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20er Haus" was called it.
But the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein was the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein and Arco, art historian with a considerable career among others in the youth as figure skaters, later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, implemented the conversion emphatically with politicians and monument conservationists, they obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Besides contemporary art, the sculptor Fritz Wotruba ’ s works were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop were to be built, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "tremendously important place" where he had "almost every weekend" seen the exhibitions.
He knew the draft of the Ur and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness during its transfer to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: The building was "an energy spinner", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Refrigeration bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors provided space for the new use, a lowered ditch of light between the house and the street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail-pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection.
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office", says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop of the city's history".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban development stroke of luck: the completely new "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being built around the Swiss garden.
And another stroke of luck might happen: the 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as one hears, she already negotiates with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway Plans Winter Crises Package in Millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, according to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than EUR 70 million this year.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-corporate crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railways and platforms to 16,000.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway leader Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays this winter after a meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, passenger rail had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have trains checked more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had a break in the train station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank Payments Million Penalties in the USA
After the turmoil around head Josef Ackermann, new discomfort comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fines there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is catching up with its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
NCUA, a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and tore the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German Federal Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the agreement of the two money-houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Cooperative Banks and starts at Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the damages caused by billions.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also buttoned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage and backed securities.
These are based on domestic loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a catastrophe for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers reversed.
Even if events have been a few years ago, banks in the US are currently facing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless lawsuits to obtain reparation or to punish violations.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest legal action.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overdividing the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank, too, has to file a complaint from the FHFA about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt authorities stand straight for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could only be poorly predicted.
However, he has now read IBM ’ s annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett ’ s investment is regarded as a knight ’ s strike in the financial world.
Accordingly, IT may now call itself "Sir IBM".
After all, Buffett now revealed in the US economy channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM ’ s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided for decent profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said on strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight iron web, a lubricant, a manufacturer, or mechanical engineers.
His holding, Berkshire Hathaway, owns not only about 80 subsidiaries, but also shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca and Coke, or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81 year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with wise investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM ’ s shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn ’ t want to board.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is being responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a ghost long believed dead has returned: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with far-right backgrounds.
That there is xenophobia in Germany was nevertheless never in question.
The uncovered far-right network, however, reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" was the title of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a "V" man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded to the conference with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate, commemorating the victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
Together had been staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" does not allow itself to draw this mental connection.
"It begins to stink," is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stresses that people have been murdered who have paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their later search success are discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier to look for suspects in far-right circles.
Some people, at least rhetorically, are prepared to use drastic means: "If we continue to silence here, then there is nothing else left for migrants but self-defence and armament".
"That will probably be the best self-protection".
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What it means, when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, illustrated the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of being on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a programme of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. At that time, in his speech, Kinkel listed how many charges the local Turks paid.
As if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax levies.
The current coverage by the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
Apart from the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for open words.
The Scandinavian Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe does not sit in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it should judge a German.
Axel Weber certainly had not thought so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newfound solidity and made friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A UBS trader in London bypassed all the bank ’ s security systems and duped around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been regarded as defeated - and everyone is asking: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012 onwards.
And he takes over the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes hard.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and central bankers, and would certainly have needed an introduction time.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand it has been sliding from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the hidden and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
And, on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced to the league of the world ’ s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view one wonders: How could I only be so wrong?"
He wandered mightily.
In 2007 it became evident for the first time that something pertinent went wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who was previously regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, one sensed why he had gone.
The bank ’ s investment division had entrenched itself with Subprime bonds and had to write billions off.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but some of them, until shortly before, would have stumbled upon: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so hidden that they did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second-best member of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was facing collapse in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The SNB bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation issued six billion Swiss francs for a forced conversion bond through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland ’ s economic performance (see chart).
"Once again we could not save the UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, the UBS capitulated to America in a tax strike and agreed to issue the data of wealthy customers who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the bank.
It also agreed to pay $780 million to repay unwarranted profits from these transactions, including a fine.
Thus the UBS more or less openly confessed to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through assistance to tax evasion.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just when you thought that now the UBS will get it back, this miserable trader ’ s story follows: A single trader twists 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something goes wrong.
And it seems that risk management in investment banking still obviously does not work.
"With the case of Adoboli, one has to realize that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a major German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it has no control over risk control."
But it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the world ’ s great wealth: no too great risks, but security for money – even beyond the Alpine republic, the world might have collapsed.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a bit bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich ’ s Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The UBS reception hall is entered by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble covered, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench and logo a big sign to the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has driven out both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not want to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS has become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits, and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became visible on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS's Crash".
Politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros, to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
UBS ’ s two different predecessors helped complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came favorably to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, the modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man, who has worked up from the banking theory to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragically, perhaps.
It is clear: arrogance came before the fall.
UBS employees are clearly reminiscent of the executives ’ meetings at which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs come off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the leaderboards that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
A few steps she had already succeeded.
She played at the top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the Bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime funds.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and passed securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks.
Still, when other banks have long sought exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when attempts to clean up turned out more difficult than thought.
posts at the UBS have become the sling seat and are still shaky.
Who leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: Stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking should shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51 year-old Italian Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution, when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has prevailed: it is intended to conduct the UBS ’ s business permanently, as announced by the Züricher Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti plans to bring the investment bank back to the mid-nineties.
He paints 3500 places.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does it want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US Stock Exchange
The impending recession in Europe has encouraged US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unaffected.
The throttled industrial production on the continent choked hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems came to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial values were on the sales tickets.
At the close of the trade, the Dow and Jones index of standard values listed a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
During trading, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S & P index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is facing the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the Statistics Office Eurostat.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
In his view, therefore, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overthrew a decades-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional corporation ’ s share price and, against the trend in trade, initially had him listed just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America ’ s share certificates were 2.6 percent higher than the market.
The house silvered almost the entire rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and raised $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institute intends to increase its capital ratio and thus fulfil tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and put the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
Around 710 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
With sales of 1.38 billion shares, the Nasdaq posted 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread out in cities
In many places, seed-crows are regarded as "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven away from the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, inhabitants complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is so far not in sight.
The experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empire said that crows could no longer be extracted from the cities.
There experts from the entire federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists have also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical brood-trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 brood-pairs exist among other things in Westphalian Soest, in the north-west among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill crows in the county had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the slaying with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the digging, brings nothing", the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer determined.
Splashing nests with water or falling trees, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden Württemberg.
"The animals evade, large colonies split and spread in other places."
Cruelty is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of mourning of animals from sensitive living areas and lock-ups is possible to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different approach to animals: "After all, we can bear a pimple on the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen Education Trail in Schleswig Holstein, where information about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows is provided.
The project is already accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, which have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use aids to get a treat, but also make their own tools.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a scaffold to collapse with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without a lot of training, they determined which size and shape a stone must have in order to have the platform collapsed.
In a second attempt the smart crows had to solve a tricky problem.
In a cylinder positioned vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wire pieces on them.
From it all four animals formed a hook, with whose help they then catch the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows succeeded in doing so right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained unfulfilled.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will be present at the European Championships 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play offs.
Led by doubly successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and completed the fifth consecutive European Championship after 0: 0.
The Czechs submitted a 1: 0 (0: 0) in the Play of the Outsider Montenegro, after the Czechs had already been a clear thing (2: 0).
There was nothing left to burn even Croatia at 0: 0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored further for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga Bundesliga champion Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a tie from about 30 meters to the early lead in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his grades and met from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by the Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from Manchester City, England, placed a penalty against the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was then the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian district council, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the Yellow Card (36.).
On the other hand Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break the vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time that the European Champion from 1976 will go to the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga champions Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of terror in the early stages.
Final man Petr Cech prevented a possible ownership by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty space limit just past the gate of Cech.
After the break the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class champion of the Czechs, again the forward of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The goal just before the end made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0: 0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to leave his place on the bench of the World Cup 3rd of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an European Championship final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, and Kazim Kazim's attacker could not sink the bounce in the goal.
After the second of terror, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmund ’ s Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga ’ s Legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin the Irish celebrated the first European Championship in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 victory in the championship, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) suited for guests.
Ireland pushed the pace right from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back-team prevent the possible leader.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident in defense of netminder Pavel Londak Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1: 0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe ’ s largest software manufacturer, SAP, will invest billions in China over the next few years and almost double the number of its employees in the country.
The Dax Group announced on Tuesday that around two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will be spent by 2015.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees", announced Co. CEO Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A Story of the First World War, Tells in Nineteen Fates" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund ’ s romantic story. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund ’ s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not inappropriately describe as "a work of anti-Semitic history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, frantic reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and terror" is almost the experience of war of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickering like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western front.
"Beauty and terror" migrates with expert views over other war locations: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers fall in this book beehives, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells of cordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war is ever going on.
"Missing facts", Englund notes, "were inflated with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely alive in Englund ’ s collection of small moments in detail.
Many of them deal with lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Spare coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel, shoes soaked with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to savagery and says about the war: "One feels that despite all this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and to do so as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and defeated shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and will take no notice of it or take care of it.
"When one refrains from the thought of sacrificing oneself, one wants to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a custom suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behaviour as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers, who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a venereal disease, in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonokokken's pus, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, in the hope of coming to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate put him in the eye, which led them to be blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund ’ s poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to ask themselves why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted than extensive history books, like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Im Westen nichts Neues".
Englunds Band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a nonfiction book.
I don't give it any more.
But it is as if with his book he had snatched this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit it with a match.
After an early error a meticulously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, and some of them carried helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed, and all the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police president Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the Protestants from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called Chaos Training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute, ” someone who is familiar with the orders said what a declaration was called“ exercise. ”
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then left when hundreds of Protestants came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operations from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like commuters, so that 1 am at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Lifebuoy with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When public officials penetrated the park in their light blue wind jackets, many Protestants simply gasped their belongings and left the place.
The police said that by 1: 45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the protestors time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said that this had been done for their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to be prevented from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials ’ dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion of personal things of the Protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning service, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some Protestants, who refused to go, were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared a short time later on the internet.
A main core of Protestants moved to position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicentre of the camp joined together in their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil Protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until about 3: 30 am.
According to the police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests occurred, as he said, because of "undue constraints and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence "Mr. Kelly" did not lead the operation ", as Mr. Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block further south.
It could be observed that from these locations the police extended the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed as several officials, many of them with shields, driven people out.
Approximately 28 persons were in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o'clock a Protestant jumped south of Pine Street onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Union of caretakers will file action against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inadequate influence on schools teaching poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity that the union, District Council 37, still has in its efforts to undo the redundancies.
Sixty-six hundred and seventy-seven school workers, care coordinators, and other employees who were among the city ’ s poorest paid employees and who had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October have described the union leader as a political vengeance for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups maintained last year to fill the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school assistance would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be directed by Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education, counting eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the City ’ s Ministry of Justice, said that the lawsuit was not before the city, so that their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a lawsuit submitted to the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city ’ s poor districts to support a lawsuit for inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have been lost and 46 volunteers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been released.
By determining the loss of five out of eight school workers employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "This is not a neighbourhood of well-to-do parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year. Moreover, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each school enrollment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission terminated, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee adopts a resolution under the leadership of President John Kerry, along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its "courage" for the successful rebellion and US troops.
"This resolution honours the brave people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of support for their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has simply been in Libya ’ s debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House were arguing about the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Moreover, the Chamber passed a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission came into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a Congress that, while upset enough to criticize Obama ’ s approach to the mission, was not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell among Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now perhaps the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Body for Foreign Relations, or will they divide the legislators, as the law of June did?
The last version comes up against the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), head of the Republican Republican Party of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Republican and Democratic legislature.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently coming to the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte ’ s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a wide range of issues.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and Senate - others are slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially those who want to polish their curriculum vitae - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an unbinding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that Congress members can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex people, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as members propose changes, so unevenly faster they move as in previous years.
In the 111. Congress legislators submitted 77 such amendments.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Stupid, but not defeated", Giffords said in the first TV interview after the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at Tucson during an election event, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She sang on Broadway alone "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in ABC's "20 / 20" news, she rang for words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the sphere that divided its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumph over the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the married couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special has been following Gifford ’ s recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC ’ s show show show that music played an important role in Giffords ’ recovery: you can see how the congressman sings together with the therapists for Cyndi Lauper ’ s “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun ” and Tom Petty ’ s“ Free Fallin ’ ”.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper on the attack on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a Missouri prison and is forcibly medically treated while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"Well, I would say," Gabby, you were not defeated, "said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will get through that and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"Soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed by, among other things, Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it was not respect, really not. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped up with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public increasingly behaves as if they were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is that of pressing us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger that the returning troops have struck against in recent years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks are held about compassion in silence and privacy between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "furious, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and, upon his return, took over a high-ranking state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked whether he was able to cope with pressure from a demanding post in Washington just after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The military ’ s lack of ease is partly rooted in Americans ’ lack of interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to take tough action on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be indicted for non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Upper gefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh what, he's 19th
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman ’ s room, the man stepped behind them, pressed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are waiting anxiously for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn, or provide appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the supreme military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically constructed," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of them may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss suit.
The acts of the court that Newsweek has before us describe in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by present or earlier soldiers for violations which have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres ’ doctrine, the government is not liable for violations inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs", says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, then the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers ’ teams play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she does not stand alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for allegedly promoting an anti-women atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America are collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", which received rape victims to dismiss them from service - a common approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration, in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for persons who claimed that they had been sexually abused on duty.
Nine laws were submitted independently to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of points of reference.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defence in 2010.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon ’ s own estimate, this figure takes into account approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded were brought to justice in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman ’ s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her aggressor, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the attack.
Six persons testified in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember well the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would put in. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: This was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her fit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged dishonourably so that she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is advancing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should make progress."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of Feres ’ doctrine throughout my life.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentives and the same deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs in future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms come," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigrant opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood to have committed a shooting in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much time in front of his computer before his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find it?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the DEMOS UK idea factory on digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett ’ s team found half a million supporters of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking up with a new band or dietary product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to consult more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It is a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoy about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more rational, democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens. ”
DEMO ’ s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three content per day, Facebooks "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you normally don ’ t reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and resolve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their intoxication on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equal level students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when posting too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko's author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping the data of its own population.
The page ’ s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine ’ s Day, turnout in 2010 midterm elections, and a National Fortune Index (using primarily information that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data pit accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to share their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don ’ t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don ’ t think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things, ” says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clip board and a pen are still the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two rounds of amok in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal against the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support Hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to address his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered Breivik police to remain in custody for 12 more weeks, not having access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remained behind lock and bar.
All participated with the goal that everything goes out to a conclusion.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors into the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not insane and said that there was no proof that he had accomplices.
Some may have liked that the July 22 attacks seemed to be the work of a single extremist, not of a group of radicalers.
But does this automatically facilitate the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple ’ s fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in the important markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors were suffering from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidioten" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley ’ s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the interview ’ s copy templates were missing during delivery.
Only after the death of Jobs a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes this Wednesday and Thursday to the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is known for abusing extensive interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four long breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he appears to be impatient in responding to Cringely's questions and urging him to respond more quickly to issues or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era recorded by Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow uncanny farsighted when assessing jobs what other companies do right or wrong in his opinion and his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous honours of career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the go to magnificence is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he set off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interviews:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years of business, I always ask," Why are you doing things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's how it's done. "
Nobody knows why he is doing what he is doing. No one in the business really thinks in detail about things.
I have noticed that.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize Apple ’ s accounting.
He developed an automated factory, which ensured that business costs could be determined to the slightest.
How the Pope was altered:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another while sanding through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and if you creep into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs tells giggly.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn ’ t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don ’ t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious coup that Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to follow Henry Kissinger so well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh out before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20 minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett's Packard.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that decrease:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs foresaw the paths on which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copier or printer, well?"
They own the equity monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product that drives people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly is eradicated by people who do not have a concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You have caught the defeat of victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you cannot do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with adversaries of health laws when court accepts case
On the day that the Supreme Court assembles behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama ’ s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the law firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for scrutiny.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which was passed last year by Congress, a law that became a slogan among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1 / 2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, presumably the outcome of which will probably boost the 2012 presidential fight, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is over will probably be Paul Clement, once Prosecutor General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement ’ s firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of federalist society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had discussed the case.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting federalist society events for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges exempt themselves from the Code of Conduct which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle of 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events of law of close and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or according to program no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alarm morals and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and danced during a charity event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they are too easy to intermingle with groups guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case for bias, because she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make institutions to do so.
Boeing to land record $18 trillion
Emirate orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the total list price for these 50 aircraft is a record $18 trillion.
Similarly unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option, as Boeing announced at Dubai Air Show in 2011, to buy another 20 aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787 ordered 8, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves the fuel consumption and comfort of the passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stockholder.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually damaging to airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging, as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important, as they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural safeguard," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing ’ s leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep Airbus ’ competitor SAS in check, which takes power with the A350.
Boeing ’ s victory in the aviation industry comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which will compete directly with the 777 ’ 300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing Shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor post.
President Felipe Calderon ’ s sister apparently lost her application for the post of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls... They occupied polling cabins, built road blockades... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Claderon scarcely, which had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother ’ s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came third, a serious defeat for the divided and hapless left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon ’ s home country and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still lasts.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will let us look courageously into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
Asia ’ s Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the eurozone ’ s rescue in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will hinder Asia ’ s economy ’ s growth.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the monetary bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC ’ s countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which look “impassioned ” at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of Europe ’ s leaders and European resources by Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We all sit in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe ’ s monetary union has been hit by a severe debt crisis in recent months.
Italy ’ s interest costs have risen dangerously in recent days, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fills fears that the global economy could fall into recession, and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide greater negotiating power for European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and dehydrating foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, like India, have no reason to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on 2 dollars or less a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India ’ s reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid civil servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have 'significant domino effects' across Asia.
ADB ’ s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / now threatens “the risk of graduation ” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital drain of their wording.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heated up the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticeably weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the pentagon halls to the war locations in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking through cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will become necessary if Congress cannot reach an end in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a thoughtful way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians at a safe and limited risk in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were ultimately met by the combat forces, "Panetta said.
"While the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," warned Panetta.
"Personnel recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"Personnel salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly not one that we should be imposed."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta ’ s letter and the Senators ’ new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or reinforce demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly pronounced the possible cuts, although he has gained many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be imminent - a military with shell, but without core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She really makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our ability to deploy and intervene globally, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall victim to deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter trailer F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground steam vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but advocates say that it is an important next step towards rearmament, so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy making the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women master. Both sides accuse each other of the lie.
Penn State ’ s leadership is accused of being persecuted because it is alleged that reports have been withheld that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he circulated denials that were quickly disproved by irrevocable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of infringements in campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and at college examinations are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the answers to the exam so that they could do well even in their performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognising lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as charades, in which the aim is to call "Hab dich!", the imposition of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities carrying out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They stutter, stammering, blush and do not always zappeln.
However, we must not conclude that these liars are difficult to uncover and to uncover.
An experienced deceiver of lies can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the assertion, the subtle expressions of the face, questions and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of unction, and it is clear that the uncovering of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to cope with in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning persons or negotiations or administration are part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how others perceive them.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to erect "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented towards others" - as a rule they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of having appealed to that person.
How do you know if someone lies?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluating changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
They should know better when someone usually always tripples with the foot so that they do not wrongly accuse him when he tripples with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of an impregnation.
People who are deceiving might become stiff when trying to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questions often wrongly signal that an interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, often shrieking the alarm bells.
There is no magic tool for unmasking lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to unmash.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after exposure by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned Canadian oil pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico, thereby annoying trade unions and reassuring environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is trying to replan the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course of action.
This happened after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course had been reviewed, which avoids the Sandhills area in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala and Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward, ” Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was designed to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta province to Texas refineries.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska ’ s legislators, who are against the plan, are weighing down the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills and Ogallala region, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton ’ s advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that Diva Patti LaBelle ’ s discotheque, in the lobby of her Manhattan building, would have had a Tobsuchtanfall that would have frightened her little daughter so that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family in front of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to start a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and put her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back to her arms," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone," You should not put your daughter off near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I am not interested in what you say or think. "
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F and A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," See what you have done with my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who still carried Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companions and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked in writing for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelles lawyer and representative did not reply to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge any fees and plan the family to donate the money they get to the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behaviour," said Davis.
"This type of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher wearing an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate adversities slow down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and who generates great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also put tight limits on the growth of the national economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical reduction in agricultural development by 31.16%, which had a slowing effect on further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continuously increased unemployment in the Mexican state. Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses on the market as a result of the cuts in funds adopted by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who are forbidden to accumulate dollars to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand because of the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and seek work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38% of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security coffers.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Agency) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a shrinkage of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be determined.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdé ’ s first year of government made government incompetence obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), represented that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and we have to make double efforts in 2012. The efforts of all, and especially the progress of the already well coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frosts. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy, which is not sufficiently on the move to generate an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Entrepreneurship Association) in Sinaloa, said that the state had to be led to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government ’ s efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily rates for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor's Office of the Republic announced that the drug smallholder was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 to monitor Cipriano Valdez Street in front of the 80 guard in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the penitent is still in the detention centre.
Debts for construction work
Miguel Ángel López Miranda said that the social buildings intended for migrants in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to a lack of funds.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority said that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, because the state government has not paid the funds due to them, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Up to now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction works, which is why a delay in the end of construction is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have given us no penny, and that, although they should have paid us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This happened to us in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had requested that administrative work be accelerated and that the outstanding share paid out as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have given us no penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, owing to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, since for the regulations concerning radio and television the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Kommission für Telekommunikation in Mexiko) is competent, therefore the decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After acceptance of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and stopped all activities for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"Nor do I believe that if we were to do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also pointed out that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because it directs national affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years around the world, and it causes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "because it comprised economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "necessitated the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state they included a group of features that put the constitution into the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, namely the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
One could not conclude that the government would intervene in the competences of the Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, "she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes not yet counted out of a total of 6074.
The possibility of counting the ballots this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data provided by the Programa de Resultados Electoral Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles, reminded Zaragoza that, just last 9 November, the election office adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits laid down for it with the argument to have neither objections against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action lodged by the local legislature and judged the State Representative's vote on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because he did not have the right to "decide or veto".
In an interview on the possibility of counting the votes, María de los Ángeles Llan stated that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local election authority could partially or completely count the ballots.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results of the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available in the form of files or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
Furthermore, the total counting of the fully filled ballots can take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition leader, who is the second of the named candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, upon completion of the regular calculation, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages suspended from a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain range, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés tricked this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the death show and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the Lieutenant Colonel ’ s last will was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in a plane of the Mexican Air Force in the event of the accident. The colonel was the closest person to attend the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the funeral hall, which lies on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This corpse show was initiated by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered over the Zapalinamé. He had always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had travelled to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A last farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was taken over with all honours by Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the Principal and pupil of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he had flown, in which José Francisco Blake Mora, Secretary of State and six other people from the same authority, crashed.
At 6: 05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, pupils and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel presented to the media eleven persons arrested in the same locality in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a barrage in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at km 1,5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige wall arose across the border.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another one dressed with a white top.
Almost one meter away was another person's body with red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three lay on their belly.
According to the information received on the ground, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, since no cartridge sleeves have been found.
On the wall of the country house are written inscriptions, which one organized criminal gang writes to another, besides several shots in wall and door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) presented 11 people, including a minor who were part of a crime trial, mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November at 6: 00 a.m., in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, the military found a car without license plates with two occupants.
During the inspection of the car the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are buried secretly in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidency Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed by a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of a government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well defined", he added.
In less than three days, Monti has managed to form a government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by the former EU commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by euro-policymakers to regain the stiff confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were burdened with 7% interest for 10 years, corresponding to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue umbrella.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would do our utmost to support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti ’ s chances of success were substantially increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi ’ s PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Center Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy ’ s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government formed by a majority of technocrats, Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or to delay reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on Monti ’ s statement that failure is a disaster.
Monti began debating with political parties, trade unions and business associations on Monday, as well as with youth and women ’ s organisations.
Tuesday evening, the meeting round is due to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who started an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, uncertainty about the new prime minister ’ s success has restored critical limits to the cost of Italian government bonds.
Saving Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will give him only time to implement the reforms, rather than preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by pressure from the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games at their fingertips.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 entrants has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the Friendship Game, which takes place today at 15.05 o'clock in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA ’ s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team only has defending player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number he reached last Friday with the game against Panama (0 and 2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (League and Cup Championship) as well as high-level European ups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish Furie at complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international matches in the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team pulling their last register: the goalie Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalie Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday against England (defeat 0 to 1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Casillas will play today against the three-colored team and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received an acknowledgment last week from UEFA, together with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle winger of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol, with 97 games, is approaching the number of hundreds.
Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and near Michael Umana are the left side winger Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The with the least games.
Less than 30 games feature in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbelia (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20's border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain ’ s historic goaltender is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored with nine most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 pm together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we have been playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only once been on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay there for a few more days.
For us it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you, because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you to stand by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have needed so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Does this not exert a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have made in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always travelled for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision, which we will play in each case, is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven ’ t played any longer, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I believe that no one of us imagined playing once in a great rock band, even for over 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We continue to count on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundant when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with all of them and we are honoured to be part of this upcoming Seattle.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all value ourselves happily to be alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better for us.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to expire this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and to what it has brought into being, without being a famous rock star. That has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and have therefore chosen the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many +
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
I think we all do not feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before come to mind, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lightly, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs embody this clearly for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990 – 2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congress member and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas Peruvian hospital to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the culmination of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks Calderón ’ s support for the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax paradise list at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still appear as tax havens. Uruguay rejected this declaration and asked his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which does not include all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
There has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay at business level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo.
The game, which comes this month to the shop counters all over the world, has been tailored from the very beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the person in charge of the Nintendo press in Spain, at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the very beginning", because so far successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less shocked users.
Afterwards, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different game levels, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", three dimensions must always be played.
This excursion of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks towards the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The bearded installer has to overcome platforms cluttered with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to money laundering of $70 million.
The trial of the US request for the extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a court holding a decision had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had allowed all extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom ’ s action is an act of government that occurs when all judicial and constitutional authorities are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if its legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister lodged a contradiction and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was established to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
There are more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At yesterday ’ s celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous officials from institutions and institutions who worked with the association during these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations of former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left the green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was visited by Josep Lluís Cleries, the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, and Jaume Lanaspa, the Director General of Social Services at the La Caixa Savings Bank.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Yesterday at noon twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction took place on a judicial order without any police intervention.
After the clearing, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on access will be controlled", confirmed the house manager.
The squatters who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the squatting.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters did their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Furthermore, the owner of the leisure area had been reported by the neighbors for resting, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the statements of the angry neighbors became more and more in the last weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that in the past few weeks she had received more complaints from her neighbours.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called last week for the building to be cleaned up without delay and to deal with the problems of civil coexistence and the coming down of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the squatters had penetrated in the last few months into all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some cases even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people penetrating the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its inscription on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few, which does not spread in the north and south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role model now was not Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogibear.
So far, in September, when the city issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is so, or someone imagines to put gates on the land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent theme that two members of this old caste meeting in the elevator can resort to.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the fabric for one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think about, and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, "it is necessary" to talk about the "mountain front" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was not carried out on the green apples, is not.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": it must not be imagined" as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas in which it is necessary to act. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that entails "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it nowadays" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built on.
"To limit something always means to define the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to General Metropolitano's plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronage of Collserola, which should not "hit deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says), "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the conditions for tendering a global view of Collserola is lacking: "16 competitions have been advertised in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountains of the Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between town and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red ’ s agent freed the mayor ’ s brother from the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red ’ s representative has given him a trial before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is leading the trial of the Monterrey Mayor ’ s brother for blackmail.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which presumably forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the lawsuit, the prosecutor ’ s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In that place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security area because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, the secretary of the district ’ s Second Criminal Court, sent him an arrest order which stated that, after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to accuse Jonás of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the proxy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor ’ s brother, to issue the sentence, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias asked García Gómez, the official of the Ministry of Público assigned to the court, whether he had rectified the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had pronounced his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name back.
In accordance with Case 197 / 2011 Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also in the following no objections can be filed against the trial, besides no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was set free immediately after hearing the representative of the betting house at 3: 50 p.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case had been placed on the files.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane accident in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the findings of the investigation on the accident, in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, indicate that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, has collided directly against the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
Furthermore, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the field where the machine had come down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found in other places, the surcharge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a matter of priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at an extra speed and had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collision."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico and the Mexico State, some low hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly, before the impact, there was neither a loss of control over the plane nor a deviation from the flight route.
Scattering of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now indicates that the helicopter had hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No indications of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the accident site do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has an incline of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minuscule search in an area that went beyond the closed off area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had collided against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol on finding the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Security Agency is conducting a research project to locate the obesity gene in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Agency of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in combination with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports fields in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation started on the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study is continued on the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said that it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill in nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also pointed out that on the above-mentioned Saturdays the examiners were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as the glucose level, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of health workers' concerns about the alarming increase in weight of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Also the overweight has increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) is, on average, 65 per cent, Indian American, 30 per cent European, and 5 per cent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the surplus of energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants would be in a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis) indicating the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the prestage.
All information is treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest changes to the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops polymers modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and assuring that if the layout and maintenance of the asphalt covering were to be appropriate, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a Technical Perspective", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with an extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they lend the road surface its characteristic visceral behavior.
Countable behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and at 50 ° C almost firm, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico ’ s city had a flexible surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt and then solidified stones.
Every single stone of this layer of wear was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he said, "one last layer is laid out, the so-called supporting layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle grips, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
The one that receives and distributes most of the forces of this road surface also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets damp, water penetrates the layer and only occurs difficult again. That causes a softening of all layers of the road covering and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a punch hole arises, "he said," the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs. "
The member of the National Research System of Mexico (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be relative to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be easily repaired without using high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had an impact on Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left blank in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, to show a silver crown and the band she points out as new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took over the crown and the cedar, the Departamento already comes to 14 Misstitel and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who almost held the crown in their hands. Among the misses proclaimed are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite, who showed at each show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor, which is considered decisive for the jury ’ s decision to appoint her First Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why? ”, which Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the author:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it is a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that was the most influential for my childhood is' The Little Prince ', a rather deep book.
I am currently reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passions'.
A response that met with little love for others, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not concretely explained the way in which each book it had influenced.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one who had received all the incidences and who had received all the prizes beforehand (Oster gastronomy contest, audience vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre) "had made the other candidates jealous of what the queen stressed, which could therefore not shine on the stage."
And they noticed this at their first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she appeared safely in both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico presented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition does not become Queen after all".
Furthermore, Valle left the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince Jurie about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that she was looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social feeling, that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derrieres and fibrosis, which she was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queens coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the stomach, which, frankly, was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, Guido Hoyos, a journalist from Cromos magazine, believes that the woman ’ s mistakes in Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay. "
Because of this award, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the performance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was inked that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether it ’ s true or not, the fact is that Melina starts her reign from today, not as queen, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a Lophoscopist of the Investigation Unit of the Prosecutor ’ s Office (CTI) of Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), went in: “Alfonso Cano ” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, was on call this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completion of the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palm and foot surfaces.
In the week of operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two corpses, and that there was suspicion that one could be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he was to take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the corpse was located with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because it did not resemble the figures he had seen in the mass media in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and predators and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many criminals file false identity documents or they have none.
We take the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in case of theft, because the thief had supported himself exactly at this point with his hand when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
Using the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded by schnapps bottles.
In the investigation it was assumed that a family member could be suspicious of action, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is nevertheless linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloscopist of the CTI explained that "fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or tape is used to carry them.
Afterwards the impressions are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personal stand office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," explained the expert of the CTI.
He said that not everything was as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is, what shines, neither is everything you touch, a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents in Zuccotti Square.
A large part followed the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called for the authorities of New York this Tuesday, when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the man-made square after they had been removed from the square at dawn and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to gain access with a judicial order that allowed the "indignant" to camp again at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement kept to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "indignants" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent eviction of the square and authorising the demonstrators to camp.
In addition, the "indignant" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give precise figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, analysing the legality of the eviction at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had reported that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and the application of "laws that were passed after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things that they had already used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that this court order has lifted the reopening of the square to the public and the demonstrators, pointing out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the square because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some shops had received threats" and the residents banged "for their quality of life".
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they were thinking about organizing "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities she will perform on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears for distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a puppet in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" program, appears as a child Jesus.
The Christmas program of CTV not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, Japan ’ s economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government ’ s initial estimates in Tokyo estimated property damage to be $300 000, a blow that, despite the difficult global economic situation, seems to weaken.
After three quarters of continuous falls, the gross domestic product figures from July to September finally served to conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the quota calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real shift in Japan ’ s economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, stimulated by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the cloudy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, foreign products are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results to the Yen listing from July to September.
While markets continue to besieging peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the global economy, revealed that the brake would have been drawn on the biggest economic upheavals.
Because it sank by four tenths to 100.4 points in comparison to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average of 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures would be adopted, but Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to wander in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and not withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication does not concede the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unblock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not endorse a commitment on the implementation of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would come back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position in terms of this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the second donor for this means of international cooperation worldwide. Its "essence" is based on the fact that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in the people".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "in particular the goal of the number of people living on income of less than one dollar a day, below the" poverty line ".
Spain continues to "work" on extending the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world, and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit which will last until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "face many challenges."
The Micro-Credit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that it was intended that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services by the end of 2015, and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the conception of microcredit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia regards as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as "an admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the lodging strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "family leader" in Valladolid and as "advocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and find solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that microcredit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people "," always standing in front of closed doors to lend "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday 14 November in Leipzig) was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was originally not provided for in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on the Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The Presidency proposal proposed by the Presidency of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The Standing Ovation, which lasted several minutes due to its intervention events, initially aimed at Angela Merkel and a few hours later at Wolfgang Schäuble, left no doubt on the part of the three finance ministers inclined towards Europe.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the request, has the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected by a modification to the Lisbon Treaty that strengthens the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area; likewise, however, this could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, to which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble was the godfather.
To be sure, the 47 are unlikely to agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however, is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal to weigh each country on the ECB ’ s board of directors according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany ’ s position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe application for a paragraph is devoted to the importance of the "German and French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of disease reports?
Following the family aid, UMP and government are now tackling disease notifications.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family subsidy fund and deliver a speech on the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is based on an attempt to test the economy in hardness, but on the other hand is no less a forerunner of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on employee disease reports.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day before considering an illness report for private sector workers.
In good German this means that a sick worker would lose the wages of four days without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but would help to raise EUR 280 million.
And that would be more symbolic with another measure: to grant civil servants an unremunerated day in the event of illness (so far there is no period of grace for them, in contrast to the three days spent in the private sector).
Meanwhile, these issues are under discussion, the majority is also rekindling the issue of fraud, with this time aimed at the abuse of labour.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will be repaid if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13, ahead of RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of disease reporting seems somewhat disproportionate.
Indeed, since 2002, this has been the subject of permanent observation, as well as of political offensives, who have borne the most fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us, however, begin with national paragraphs.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily severance payments in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% on maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% on disease leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% health spending.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, an average of only 14.5 sick days were granted to the French by a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of disease notifications in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days; 15% between 15 days and one month; 15% between one and three months; and 11% above.
Compared with its European neighbours, French workers are no longer tending to be incapable of working.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (disease- or otherwise justified) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave accounts for a tiny amount of undeclared work.
There is only a weak level of fraud.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic controls on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (Public University of Apprenticeships and Continuing Education of Engineers and Engineers) found, under 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term disease reports realized, i.e. "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days of illness, less than 1.2 million were 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed an illness report.
A paragraph which represents only a weak dimension compared, for example, to those of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a July report on this issue, this represents between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion in tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus much more than the demarcation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted by the Union to his government were not enough to do this.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Prime Minister in his first public speech opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone would be "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by 9%" of GDP from today until the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing wing, had given his assent on Monday to the measures already approved for an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but forwarded that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his New Democracy Party.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to combat waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, as emerges from a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, health care institutions, and doctors collaborated on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, including beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually want to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved who are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends to the government to amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, in patients considered able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts quote a recent survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in 10th place, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the topic of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to analgesic drugs, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the Canadian majority ’ s desire to die at home, 68.6% of them ultimately die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital is highest in Quebec.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed no intention of amending the law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would entail abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide of uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such transgressions are encountered in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, yesterday confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already committed themselves in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that these allowed people to mitigate their suffering at the end of their lives.
66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia does not lead to the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to those who have already practised an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of remedies in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Likewise, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the Criminal Law should indicate that the removal of the means for which a legally valid rejection had been found should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the removal of resources at the end of their lives, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel said that governments, health care institutions, and doctors collaborated on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, including beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to the remedies already used in Canadian health care institutions, the body calls for pain relief or life-saving measures to at least consider them, since they did not, like euthanasia, serve to reduce physical pain and to refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts among other things as "extreme", since these set no limits for euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone who is alive and older than 18 years is asking another person to assist him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility above all the other values involved in the social work of society.
But now, he says, there are 'guidelines and obligations in a society'.
Margaret Somerville, a healthcare specialist, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called the "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Bashar al Assad demonstrated yesterday to the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria ’ s Bashar al Assad, which, thanks to Russia ’ s support and a “plotting ” against the country, has intensified.
Two days before Syria ’ s exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite the position taken by Turkey and Jordan, Syria ’ s neighbouring countries, in favour of President Assad ’ s departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the incumbent Arab Prime Minister who called on President Bashar al Assad "to lay down his power in Syria", in which 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Saw Bashar's interest in the heart of his country, he would cede, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of the Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In view of the repression in Syria, the international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have taken on an ever-sharper tone," Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, observes.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power have died in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in the besieged city of Homs in "Shooting Changes and Heavy Bombs for Jobar".
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Valid al Muallim nevertheless believed that the country was "heading towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded forcefully to the Arab League ’ s decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a “dangerous step ”.
Syria "will not yield," he added, "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "civilian protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which after encapsulates him in his "paranoia".
A new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial and likely withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday classified the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" to guard against any possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy:
Monti exhorts the markets to patience and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, for his part had to wait for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence before Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday the nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he underlined, "be sure that the markets will be dusty and understandable."
His appointment by the President was welcomed at the outset by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should exist only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working urgently to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary adjustment in 2013, despite the austerity plans that have taken place in recent months, has in particular requested new measures of hardship.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of the heads of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery", because a country that has no growth at all cannot respect the deficit indicators ".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconi"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as another Italy, according to the editorial authors.
The big unknown here are the longevity of its rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International AIEA Agency and other documents issued by this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA announced its "serious concern" at a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to in-depth studies of the AIEA ’ s documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently worked for more than three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and participated in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was said to have left the centre to found a company in Kiev that produces "Nano diamonds".
His company ’ s economic difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that Iran's development of a" nuclear explosive system "had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only involved in this technique, but also, as a member of the agency's state said, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims rose by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI ’ s statistics published on Monday, either declined slightly in the same period or increased only slightly.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-terrorist crimes and crimes.
According to the FBI, the total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases on a very weak scale, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organisation Human Rights First. "The rise in anti ‑ Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, a head of the organization, added.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is an inheritance in American federal law from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, Microblogging ’ s Twitter website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" make it easier to read live the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") you track and track your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu had been tested before its general internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users", according to the Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with a somewhat esothereal wording (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
In the network, users debated this innovation through certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and resembles too much Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The" Activity "function will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," announced @ dannykronstrom.
Austria:
Registration of a "Golden Household Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic / Christian Democratic coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the top credit rating of Austria (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen from AAA to AA + at one stroke, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels summit of euro area Member States on 26 October: Heads of State or Government would have asked for the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and for a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year; from 2017, the state ’ s structural budget deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, whereas regional states, as well as municipalities, should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in Horizon 2020 / 21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continued to rise, Japanese authority would intervene again in the currency markets.
"If we find excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold Yen massively for dollars to lower the Japanese currency value, which is steering a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly, doped by purchases of investors who regard the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the dollar listed around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east)," said M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the yen can kill the weak recovery already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power has again gained -1.5% on the previous quarter, for the first time this year thanks to the leaps in export revenues and the consumption of the "sealed" households caused by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister estimates that the yen ’ s inflation does not reflect “Japan ’ s economic foundations. ”
In turn, Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", thereby making it known that no additional currency easing could be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Federal Reserve had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to repay the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial titles in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast up, stock exchanges make withdrawal
The contagion risk of the debt crisis constantly undermines European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are steadily increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting into negative regions this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets continue to share their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the contagion risk," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which itself suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 o'clock the European Valuta was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it yielded by 0.4%.
According to the stock market brokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted an application, which provides in particular the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the eurozone without at the same time leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, and that of Spanish bonds reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to stimulate investor fears.
The future Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Monti, called for more time for the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by paralysis by the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is on the market as the country's parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The interest rate gap ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded 0.4% fiscal growth in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE, however, had revised the balances of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first calculation of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 o'clock, with the EU Commission warning against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an opportunity to vote, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing forward a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, not to have to give up an enormous proportion of the world ’ s population on a vital element.
At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find a substitution source, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build nuclear power stations of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
For their part, after Fukushima, the United States decided to join its park by reinstating the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on Russia, in particular, due to increased reliance on import gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power stations.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, and, on the other hand, is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness and a national stability of industry, French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of the French are not prepared to pay, as they show resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us bear in mind that our country ’ s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would assign an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation one has to admit that there is just as little miracle agent for generating electricity as there is a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the Flamanville site.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it proceeded without consequences for humans and environment.
In Chernobyl the drama was summoned by reactor construction as well as indefinable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power station, a stop at Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subjected to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students on the part of the authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France had "no need for talent, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from the economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right the tone of Jacques Chirac was struck, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 had stated that France "could not absorb all the world's poverty".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both the right and the left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande ’ s programme is limited to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems ”.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent work summarising the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would defuse growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to substitute the local workers, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in reality, much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are unemployed in terms of workplace technology.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic wage workers, and the more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not adapted to the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants will bring about an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas created by immigrants is beneficial as well as economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average around 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 contributes a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the lack of intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had endured the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy win over their enemies once and for all.
Since Napoleon "the little one" is known that it was a characteristic of the mindset.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become a "means of repression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, justice.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True False referendum would have had a doubly revealing character in this regard: the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in accordance with the needs and in a wrong order.
A free ticket for the European single ruler or a leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the enumeration - because there is only one single crisis, and it reigns in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which are suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give people ’ s sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
It is because it is up to us whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be made without total democratic legality, without certainly leading us to ruin.
After Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought this proposal for a long time, everyone today is pushing European economic governance to do so.
Consent.
But imagining this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it would be for the citizens - would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We must take a new stage in European integration.
In order to create the republic in France, it took the fact to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This information remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become the general good
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards and telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold one year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after having been lagging behind for a long time in the Asia Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were disseminated.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued this year 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"In future, two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over their customers bank cards equipped with a contactless chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A tiny percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology necessary for carrying out these transactions.
"They are in default".
"But they should at least experience a real upward development next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale, too, announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would enable its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected relations between the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty".
"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations of the secret services point to clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in the Niger last January has revealed interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for more clear evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"But it is conceivable".
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly evident in their course, as have the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now point to the addition of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to start with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminati who need not be given special attention.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It is politicizing itself and demanding strict observance of the Sharia, while its affiliated activists are fighting the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction, however, is as usual indifferentiated.
The army surrounded the city, with 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who is imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then to another one in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide bombardment that occurred in the security police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since worried all security experts.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis operating al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem on the occasion of a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed his readiness to "communicate all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and Israel.
Can a depressed America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades have repeated their thundering declarations and their statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican emphasis.
Slogans about China, Iran and Israel are often not supported.
The Mitt Romney, who is the highest on the agenda regarding the appointment of the Grand Old Party, threatened to quote the Chinese to the WTO and to accuse them of the "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America that has been excessively irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
He said that if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, it would be stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of external politics, has almost faded his emotions.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama ’ s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also praised military blows against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
"If I am elected, I stop Iran," he had sounded.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest placed candidate, in turn shows a shameful file identity.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be contra, because Beijing was "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be paying attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
For his part, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, expresses his willingness to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama ’ s 2009 refusal to resort to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry, and Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an out-of-political weight.
Contrary to the current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama too was an amateur and had to give water to his wine, which was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite as unforced.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has eliminated.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more adequately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendour and gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday under orchestral sound and with a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolically jointly rotated the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is to supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length linking the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg's Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to total French consumption, is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And one already lets the eventuality of the construction of a third line echo itself.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, the Northern Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route by land through third countries (Poland or Ukraine).
That is why these two countries are losing a little of their power: they are now finding it more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily engaged in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the Northern Stream pipeline with a "new German pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of de-vigorating European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas resources are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of Gazprom ’ s numerous gas supply managers in Lubmin.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be evaded.
"Approximately hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long serpent of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state-owned company permanently settling at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas transmission in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
This case, however, is considered to be unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel, and by an apparatus which circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on any metal deformation upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (15.5% each), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a business group called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on an extendable twenty year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the actual volume of gas transported is," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy coastline with pine forests near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipeline.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, these would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent by candlelight with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, the egg-coloured sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was written in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned to launch the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique, called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton lacquer used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook is just as enthusiastic about business people as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and knows how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the e-mails", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (detour)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard cover on the market at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine profited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify its products: bags, schedules, filler, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that Neider is putting on track: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, said Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who is organizing the" Week of Work for the Disabled. "
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for the disabled unemployed before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no Abitur and only 10,000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% for the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it more difficult to re-enter the labour market and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which certainly but slowly develop.
A study carried out in April by the IMS association Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers questioned had "a weak level of knowledge about disabled persons", which "is over-represented" by persons in wheelchairs, psychologically or intellectually minors ".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a law of 1987.
These last figures from 2008 indicate a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof is that the number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased, as has the amount of amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, put strong pressure on companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the premises employ disabled persons between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a Happiness"
Even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (8: 45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his aggressor against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures for his part.
As for the contrast between his presentation in club and national team, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
But without refraining from the touch of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to further enhancing the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked the way".
"To play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made it sound "pride" with kindness.
"The pride to carry out a Galamatch".
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbor" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very well to share the plane with the Blue (the French national team)... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big", he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." Included in the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the match against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the season both teams had lacked the objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to shave an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the hinspiel (0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the match for more than an hour, but the team was not able to press the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved a foreign door".
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to beat through in front of an audience that is just as hot as the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42 year old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the European Championship in 2012," said Carlos Queiroz.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved a foreign door", Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have the intention to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "give them no time to think".
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
