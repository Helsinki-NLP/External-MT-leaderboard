The right-wing populists in Austria are winning, with a total of 29%
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, following the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of its previous chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously threatened.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
The results so far show that the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it has lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote at 25.6 percent.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
The Socialist Group has been in favour of the report, but it has not yet adopted the amendments.
But the voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and previous vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen at an extraordinary meeting of the party executive board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberal Party (FPÖ) had provisionally received 18 percent of the vote and the BZÖ 11 percent - the Social Democrats also expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated, when the PP had reached agreements with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, but split from the BZÖ in 2005) on a joint government, which had even led to sanctions from the European Union.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet decided on the future of the programme.
The Greens also entered the Parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
I am sure that the Commission will be able to do this in the near future.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting bugs is not resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after his meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not resolved, then it will certainly be a cooling off", he said after a meeting on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive would have difficulty intervening in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, felt that it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He could ask for bail and be free to await his sentence, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be eligible for a pardon", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide "competent legal assistance" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being offered by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining good relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians admit it too", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reiterated to his partner, according to the Czech news agency ČTK, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists", he explained.
The Minister avoided answering the question whether he had received an undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I have already been promised quite a lot", he merely stated.
A Czech judge rules on the struggle for the sea floor
He approaches an electronic map showing Australia and its surrounding seas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is part of Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, a member of the 30-person team of the UN Division of Oceans and Maritime Law.
The head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows up and adds to the interpretation from time to time.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The ocean floor contains a world that is so far little known and so rich in natural resources.
It is a place where oil, ores and other non-renewable resources are found, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea floor larger than the mainland
The coastal states today vehemently announced their claim to the new sea areas.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends into the sea several hundred kilometers from a country's shore.
This country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
'In simple terms, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its bottoms which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It goes beyond the borders of the coast, often even the 200-nautical-mile limit of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the determination of the external boundaries of the continental shelf must be supported by a large amount of scientific and technical documentation based on many costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five proposals from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded", Mikulka adds.
Recently, Australia's success in becoming the first country to significantly expand its marine areas has received international attention.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the sea floor area approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, or about six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profits from the use of the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
The Commission will also be presenting its proposals in a phased manner.
They can do this for 10 years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls "the common heritage of mankind".
No state will have a special position here.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a goldmine", says Mikulka, adding that "the individual areas are clearly defined by law and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the sea floor now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc in the framework of the Interocean Metal Joint Organisation.
The Convention granted it, like investors from a few other States, the status of a 'pioneering investor' in 1991.
The organization has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it's a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"It covers a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division, Rober Sandev, brings one such concrete as a sample.
It reminds me of a small potato or, with a little imagination, the fabulous scheme that brought the legend of the Golem to life.
German special forces were on the scene during the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they didn't come.
More details are emerging about the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of GSG 9, the Fliegerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Service were at the place of liberation.
However, as spokesmen for the ministries continued to report on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, that did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian travelers were abducted by attackers in southern Egypt on September 19.
After being kidnapped in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth across the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as did the details of their release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages are in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, at first, there was no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five vacationers and the special forces are to be flown out by an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones crashed.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme to stem the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the supporters had been desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on the House to approve the plan, even though it was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political credit for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
The Dow Jones dropped more than six percent, or 600 points, during the vote.
The reason was investors' concern that the state rescue package might fail.
He recovered just before the end of the vote, only to collapse again after the failure was announced.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The programme must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate before it can enter into force.
The number of bookings is increasing
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the number of travel bookings for the coming months has increased significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, a study shows that the desire of Germans to travel remains unabated.
Travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in winter bookings compared with the same period last year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
The research carried out by the market research institute GfK shows that bookings have already increased for the autumn months.
The increase in turnover of travel agencies for October was about 11 percent compared with 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
The DRV said that travel to the USA was particularly in demand because of the weak dollar exchange rate.
The increase in bookings here is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the home territories, are particularly popular destinations among Germans.
Package travel in particular is a high priority, said Dr. Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of rising energy and food costs, he said, the costs "are more calculable for the customer than for an individually organised holiday".
The Commission's proposal to set up a European network of information centres for the information society is a step in the right direction.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jars and celebrities in designer dirndl.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Crown Sugar and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV host, and she wears a custom dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: barely three minutes on Wiesn, the photographers are already pounding on us and squeezing the memory cards full - very flatteringly and that on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be serving its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Worm Equator, the feeling of well-being in the suit has been limited to date.
But once you get to the Theresian meadow, it's half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or is embarrassed to touch - all perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only my dirndl apron gets.
A woman from Munich reminds me that I tied the apron wrong: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right granted, back widowed".
I'm secretly learning the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits", he said, laughing.
Others, using less subtle flirting techniques, wear simple fur hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare buttocks out to an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, he comes from England and is also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's gorgeous, with a long "ooooo".
He'll tell me after he's gotten rid of his previous dose.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wild beer" people.
Others are not so fortunate as to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics swarm across the square to care for the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in packs - always four at a time, hauling a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: empty to the front, full back.
You can't tell who's in the coffin under the plane.
"These are the ones who are going to take no prisoners", one of the paramedics called out to me on request and disappeared into the confusion.
The name of the accident victim has been released by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been released.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He's been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of that failed imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building's going to fall apart.
But once you're inside the arched ticket office, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost entrance was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, being a late bloomer in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were paralyzed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces were moving out of Egypt, driving the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of ammunition exploded, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling apart, largely forgotten by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east, to highlight Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The Commission has a policy of rapprochement.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the leading ACP foreign policy experts, the Turkish member of parliament Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on the tracks that produced the old world equanimity in the famous documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city for the new secular state project of turning its back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, which is known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the headquarters of the ACP, a specially constructed, state-of-the-art structure of stone and steel, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and taverns where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception", he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wouldn't be one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point", I asked, "be forced to make a decision?"
"Turkey", he said, "did not want to have to face this decision".
He then made a point which almost everyone I spoke to here has made almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that Europe as a whole can, figuratively speaking, travel on the same flat railways eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
I was at the Hydarpasha station, after another largely sleepless night, thinking of these two German gentlemen, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the docking station for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at the time, there seemed little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating land.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he formed his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was designed for youths up to the age of 21, but when the choir sang its last song in 1979, some of us were in our late 20's - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name Proteus (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to take on any piece of music that was presented to them, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether it was a cappella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and existed solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music that never waned over the years.
How many times has death told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never overbearing but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded something even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years or so, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in a single one - I've often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He despised conductors who, in his words, simply "cozied up to one or two of the world's best-known show horses".
So many of us will miss him.
I 'm not going to lie .
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship ... while simultaneously studying for a BSc, MA and PhD.
This is a conclusion drawn from a writer's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It's not clear why Woodruff would want to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
̋I recommend the José Vicente Resino exhibition ̋Flamenco and life' because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are fantastic.
They drew my attention to their simplicity and the power they exude, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.
Second round of the Honda super sale.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale saloon has a much larger one.
In addition, there are technical refinements that make driving even more convenient and fuel-efficient.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new flexibility of space, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before we begin to analyze the new model, we must say that this new jazz appears six years after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this year of 2008.
After the Jazz was released, about a million were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, representing 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2 000 Jazz models a year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's executives hope to end the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this sales increase, Honda increased its market share in Spain from 1.6 % to 1.8 % compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2 % in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is betting on the appearance of a new model.
The Insight is a five-door, compact hybrid car measuring 4.7 metres in length, which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 a year worldwide.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, with its first public presentation in January in Valencia.
In the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its glory.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, remains unchanged at 5 feet 5 inches.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due to the new space flexibility programme and the central positioning of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the boot, which has a double-loading system, also reaches up to 339 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first-generation boot.
It should be emphasised that these measures are in place for the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, as the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Other improvements, apart from additional features such as leather seats or the possibility of panoramic windows, include improved access to the seats.
The angle of opening of the back doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz was only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model had two versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2 litre version produces 90 hp at 6 000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min.
This petrol engine - the predecessor of Jazz's 78 hp - consumes 5.3 litres of petrol and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The engine, which had previously produced 83 hp, is now capable of producing 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has a 5.4 litre fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Car bee, which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, more specifically, from bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the behavior of swarms of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in technologies for accident prevention.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan's four-layer safety shield.
This robot is supposed to make sure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, much like the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the bee's faceted eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, allow it to fly uninterruptedly in its personal airspace.
To recreate the all-round perspective, the engineers developed what is called the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance signal
`The minute an obstacle is detected, the small robot will mimic the flight of the bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90o or more to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference from any other system is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move up or down, but it cannot move across the plane; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to spin its wheels, and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways that bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to help the small robot avoid collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds each to process the information and act on it.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed to be stored, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage.
This may sound surprising, but it's not about the GBs or even the MBs of storage.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in production cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide it to its destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's shaking before she's burdened with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Treasury, besides having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to avoid getting the American public involved in mortgage stories from supposedly solvent banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or maybe the hotel of bad credit or the hotel of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice and even three times about whether it's time to ask for no loan.
And most importantly, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
I'm sure she has some useful information, but no details.
This is more of a teen site than a place for the whole audience.
What happens when the game expands?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least a little, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley is providing its capital to MUFG.
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, which would make it the first bank in Japan to issue $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, a development due to a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a price of $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is below 19% of the share price on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will provide a 10% profit and can be resold at $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on a uniform average price of $29, 28% above the current market value.
However, Morgan Stanley's share fell 6.79% to $23.07 around 5pm GMT.
̋This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding banking status,' said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley took that status last week, which should allow it to expand into new areas of business, but under Federal Reserve oversight.
Her connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced on Monday, also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
̋A week ago, ̋ said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo, ̋we thought the holding would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will result in a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the sale price, i.e. at approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had seen a significant decline in its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, as they have seen their stock price fall by half while the price of their insolvency insurance skyrockets.
This price fell on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had raised $15 billion, some of it from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic must be re-established around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was this third man who, following the example of his friends and colleagues, proposed this Sunday the draft of a new constitution.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the debate on the future of the European Union.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of all votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for the 'Yes' party, predicting 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
"The Constitution has triumphed in a sweeping way", he said in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, congratulating Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), concerned a 444-point text on securing the "new socialism" advocated by the President.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that sends emigrants into the country.
The project, which is being pushed by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants the head of state greater power, allowing him to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free health care and education, which the President has already begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched an attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who had been held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
The next morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages, who appeared to be in good condition, arrived at the al-Maza military base, near Cairo International Airport, by special aircraft at about 3:30 p.m.
They were immediately taken by helicopter to Maadi Hospital, a foreign neighbourhood in Cairo, without being able to speak to the press, for examination.
They are all in 'excellent health' and no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", said Egypt's tourism minister, Zoheir Garanna, on the runway.
After being captured on September 19 during an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages were repeatedly taken from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - are also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, which organises the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`Shooting was on both sides and half the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomatic corps, Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role played by Italian intelligence agents and special forces.
̋We must acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men,' he explained without elaborating.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the leader, who was from Chad, and arresting two.
The army stated that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), but this was immediately denied by the movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pathetic sums of money being given to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historic sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, to effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have a constitution that says that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American people, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of Congress and all government districts, and that must be done in a mutual vote.
In Quebec, at the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 historical societies are working hard to study history, save the many private archives and preserve the archaeological remains with a few pennies.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of despair when funders and decision makers unleash their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are to partially nationalise Fortis Bank, a Belgian-Dutch bank in turmoil following the US financial crisis, by providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations over the weekend with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis, which has been going on for a year, and therefore decisions now taken in relation to the bank could be precedent-setting.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries will buy about 49% of the bank's shares.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, in particular the insurance business acquired by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' shares started a steep decline last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big to fail.
The institution's securities fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
According to management, the US bailout of $700 billion and the resulting market uncertainty are to blame for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director-General of the Bank.
The bank was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, sought reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person's medication use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection schemes which link the use of medicinal product data to the consent of the data subject in all cases.
These should be in independent hands, or we'll leave the chickens to the fox". - Richard Dick, developer of the prescription tracking program, quoted in The Washington Post.
Insurance companies set the premiums and the amount of the loss insurance depending on the health of the customer, and if the risk is considered too high, the insurance is not taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more cost-effective method: he uses the customer's identification number to obtain the data from pharmacies for the last year and a half, i.e., which drugs were purchased, and the program calculates from that the patient's illness and health condition.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it would indicate that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, automatically placing him at a higher risk.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies have to deal with paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for a variety of purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers' point of view, while the above are not.
The data are collected and processed by private societies which ask patients for their consent before collecting the data.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Some companies even combine laboratory test results with drug usage data to provide a more accurate picture of a patient's health.
More and more companies are gaining access to data, and at the same time controlling their use is becoming more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, which would allow the authorities to control data processing companies as well.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program further so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another issue is, of course, that the data subject is unlikely to be able to refuse access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are, in a way, left to the mercy of the fox.
A global meal from Marseille
EU and India double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic of the ninth summit, alongside other global issues.
Today the French-Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is the main topic of discussion.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power which should have a greater voice and voice in international affairs, but its Member States have so far been unable to agree on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not even discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.An agreement was reached to double trade to over €100 billion over the next five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not even that ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into one agreement, thus boosting aviation in the future.
India aims to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced EU-India relationship: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
The European Union has also been a key player in the fight against terrorism, and the United Nations has been called upon to take a decisive role in this.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides bearing the blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it was committed to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the proposal to reach some kind of global compromise at the next climate summit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States which are not in a position to take part in the European Union's action programme.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, they hope to get contracts worth EUR 20 billion from French firms to build nuclear reactors in India.
The Agency reports that the agreement will be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
The presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt is strong.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to present over 403,000 titles, spread over 171,790 square metres of exhibition space.
The Italian Government will be represented by Maria Giro, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, at the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference in Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair, close to the Room Structure, to discuss the figures, trends and prospects of the publishing industry in Italy.
The data show that the importance of books by foreign authors is declining in general, but particularly in the adult and youth sector.
The missing plane of billionaire Steve Fossett has been found
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The pieces were found on a 3,000-meter high plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson, in a press conference, completely dispelled the last of the doubts: "The plane has been located, a team has been sent to track it down, and we are now certain that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared".
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the aircraft.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a team was dispatched to identify the aircraft, the Bellanca 8kcab, which went missing on 3 September 2007 after Fossett took off for a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Finally, yesterday, also in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two I.D.s in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in his sixth attempt, becoming the first person to orbit the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single nonstop flight with a plane.
Among his many records is a flight of 15,445 meters over the Andes, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
An SUV that stands out from the traditional designs for its original design and special linearity, its expansive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this offroader.
It is precisely because of its exceptional characteristics that the presentation of the SUV Glk, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October, will be unconventional.
The advertising drum that will accompany the launch of the new model will also be in a new dress, in the form of a 3D campaign, a novelty in the automotive sector in Italy.
A high-profile project, to be carried out in several phases on Milan's central shopping district, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will be the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed around the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its near-real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear to stand out from the poster on which it is pictured.
The new glk is then illuminated at different times in all its details by means of the Elumina8 technology, in order to assemble itself as a whole.
The aim of this advertisement is undoubtedly to introduce a new type of advertising in this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be able to attract the interest of future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They're from the Triveneto. Now they're risking a stadium ban.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to do so.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The group's origins lie in the right milieu.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In addition to these, there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They are wearing the tricolor that shows the militants' cities, but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, the clash now came with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Italian fans had been provided with 144 tickets for the match by FIGC, all of which were issued in names and thus easy to check.
In fact, they were all checked by the criminal: none of those who travelled to Sofia were in the middle of a stadium ban proceedings.
Four Italian team fans who were already pre-loaded in this respect were also denied tickets and travel to Bulgaria.
The criminal is now waiting for the Bulgarian police to report on the incident and take further action: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a minimum five-year ban from the stadium.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will never set foot in a stadium again.
Thank goodness.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats who might follow him by a little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that no such behavior should be allowed to be justified under any circumstances", the criminal complaint says.
Therefore, "Eyes on, especially with a view to the national team game on Wednesday in Lecce".
Because in fact, there is a small core of Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Observatory (Sports Authority) will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, who can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-duce shouting and raising the right arm during the anthem of Mameli?
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (he took over from Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now hails from.
While it is true, Mazzilli says, that praising the Duce is not against the law in Bulgaria, the behavior of those 150-200 people was undoubtedly shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the number one of the Observatory, "crimes are punished in the country where they are committed.
The Commission has been very careful to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
But we also talk about the whistles during the Mamelis anthem: even this is not a crime, but allow me, there is a lack of education ... ".
