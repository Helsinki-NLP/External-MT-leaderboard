The possibility of a liquidity gap is a concern for the British Isles.
There is a certain affinity among some MEPs for the proposal that their entitlement should be transferred to MEPs (UK Member of Parliament).
The isolation resulted from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
AMs across the political spectrum are threatened with a possible vote of no confidence.
One MP told the Labour Party that his group was worried about the way he deals with Twp and Pwp"
Note to readers outside of Brittany: twp means stupid and pwp means shit in Brittany.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was not satisfied, and that alternative suggestions have been made.
One person told the Socialist Party that his group was concerned about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet in English.
In this context the letter w in English is pronounced in conjunction with the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes said: "It is of course up to the Members themselves to take the final decision on any reporters under the name which will be given to Assembly Members".
The Assembly of Wales was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which had gained widespread support for the designation of the assembly as the British Virgin Parliament.
As for the title of the NAMs, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) was the Commission's choice, but it was the MWP choice which received the most support in public consultation.
MEPs appear to be proposing alternatives, but the wait for an opinion could prove a heartbreaking one for the Chief Audit Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft negotiation on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation under the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of MEPs and the design of the committee system.
The HAMs are the last to vote on what title they will be called when they debate the legislation.
The day of the vote is upon us for the Macedonian people in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will cast their votes on Sunday on the right to change the country's name to 'Republic of North Macedonia'".
A compromise on the referendum was reached as part of an effort to resolve the years-long border dispute with Greece, which also receives the name Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and successive protests have led to opposition to its application for EU and ECAT membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for membership in the EU and ECSC.
St. Martin's Clock stops and the Harlem Chapel rings
"Historically, the ancients I spoke with said that there were bears and temples around every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"None of those are there today".
He said that he had anticipated the couple's departure.
"People go out in different ways" today, he said.
"The bars are no longer the public lounges that people go to on a regular basis".
For the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling assets will not last as long as merchants are craving, "and sooner or later they will just be right back where they started".
Churches could be replaced by apartment buildings, full of the kind of people who do not contribute to the prosperity of the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people", he said, "and they will therefore accelerate the day when these apartments are completely demolished because most of the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by light-skinned communities before Harlem became a blue-skinned metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Modha people died of yellow fever in the 1930s.
The building was named after a blue-collar community that worshipped close by.
St. Martin's was occupied by a community of blue-eyed people under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the retailers of 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blue-eyed people.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parish commissioners with Father Johnson shared the plan when they planned reconstruction plans.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his grandson at St. Martin's, was the one who baptized the clergyman on the record.
The expert who performed the record in July called it something else: "a cultural water" and "an historical musical instrument whose replica could not be found".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that the world's first recording of a blue-collared violinist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the smaller recording at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not found a representative for him.
The artists and contractors who have been seen at St Martin's in recent months have been a mixed bag, some brought in by church bell ringers, others by the diocese of the area.
It was the vicar - the governing body of the parish itself - who wrote to the diocese in July about his concerns that the diocese would seek to pass the costs on to the vicar, although the vicar was not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent in by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners grumbled about the lack of transparency on the part of the church.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a shark while diving under a bright star in California.
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving for a swimming pool in California on the first day of the swimming pool season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chad Hammel said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then rushed over to help him withdraw.
Hammel said that he first thought it was just a sliver of a glue, and then realised it was a piece of cake.
We have been robbed!'
His whole frame was fused together", said Hammel as he turned to the boy.
"I've let everybody out of the sun: 'There's a shark under the sun!'" said Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified as having a bad case.
It was not clear what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The Captain of the Coast Guard Larry Giles said at a briefing for the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was not considered to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim had sustained traumatic injuries in the course of her visit.
The entrance offices on the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas were closed for 48 hours for inquiries and for safety purposes.
Giles noted that there were no more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's is about to enter the UK market for its schemes.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its multi-storey style scheme and special assistant staff.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8bn retail market, which is still growing despite declining sales of fashion and household goods, the larger scheme passes will be trialled in 11 more stores around the country, and will be rolled out to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in screen goods comes as part of the efforts of supermarkets to fill shelf space in their TV sets, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its scheme items by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded ranges like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique fashion range, so that the majority of products are usable by vegans - something more demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing a split in its shops with Sainsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with a second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Trends in online shopping and buying small portions of food every day at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to lure people in.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the centres would gradually look like department stores as the chain sought to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has replaced Argos in its hundreds of stores, and also introduced several Habitats since they bought both sets of stores two years ago, which they say has boosted hairdressing sales and contributed to the profitability of the retails.
The wholesale market had previously tried to renew its schemes and pharmacy departments from the ground up.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after disagreements over how to distribute profits from the pharmacies to its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but added an additional area of responsibility to the luxury brands now that would include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four ships.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have fundamentally changed the look and feel of scheme packages to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in expert colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every demand, and the attractive environment and convenience sites mean we are now a top-class destination scheme that challenges the old shopping street".
Peter Jones is a fool after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the market £11 million
Dragons' Peter Jones was left in the lurch after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11 million lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and with HITV.
Willoughby is no longer available for its Truly home goods and accessories brand.
Goop's beard and brand business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has taken Dragons Den star Peter Jones home with her retirement from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and hITV.
Our sources of knowledge said that Jones was on the edge of her seat when she admitted during a meeting with a white TV presenter on Tuesday at the headquarters of her in-house business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - which have grown to £1.5 million - to focus on her Truly furniture and home furnishings brands.
The business was compared to Goop's brand by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune estimated to be equivalent to £11 million.
With Willoughby, 37, announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones took a detour out of Britain with one of her holiday homes as his target.
The source of knowledge said: "It was Truly who had one of the priorities for Holly.
It would be like a long-term future for her that would sustain her life for decades.
All those involved in its decision to withdraw from the market were recalled.
No one would have believed what Tuesday was doing, because it was so close to the launch.
There are shops in the First Quarter in Marlow that are full and ready to sell".
Experts believe that the demise of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the firm millions due to the investment it has made in its range of consumer goods and clothing and home goods, and could cause further delays in its launch.
And it could end a friendship that has lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp west in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production business.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will take on the role of representing Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on the state of affairs of his business".
Hard talk 'and we fell in love then'
He laughed at the criticism he received from the news media for the comment that would be "unnecessary" for some people's eyes, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump lost so much?
Trump said in his acceptance speech that he was a "major newscaster".
"I have lost nothing".
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump had heralded as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have reached a culmination.
More than three months have passed since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly last Saturday. The North has not seen a corresponding U.S. response to North Korea's initial efforts towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the EU continues to impose sanctions with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump was far from being a superstar in his speech.
"We are doing very well in dealing with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to take the war to North Korea.
Millions of people would die if they did.
And now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the rocket tests were halted, they helped to free prisoners and to bring the bodies of members of the American armed forces home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so rude, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get in this crowded place, 200 people would be standing up", Trump said, referring to the crowd right in front of him.
Hundreds of people on island killed by Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need to be present.
Although no more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was expelled from their own areas, no national disaster was declared, which was pre-conditioned to generate the international aid.
"In many cases unfortunately they have said implicitly that they do not want international aid, so it is quite challenging", Mr Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether the foreign team can get to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to the relief effort.
Given the continuing earthquake in Indonesia, preparations for natural disasters are horrifying.
Although anti-sunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not normally seen on any other coast.
The apparent absence of a warning flag before tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was in place, probably contributed to the loss of livestock.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging when there are waves.
Logistics becomes much more complex with natural disasters.
A hospital ship based in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to reach the site of the recent disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's broken infrastructure the core of his election campaign, and has spent heavily on roads and railways.
But the administration of Joko suffered a shortage of funds as he faced his re-election the following year.
Mr. Joko is also coming under pressure from the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as clashes between Christian and Muslim street fighters, and masons, bows and sails, and other heavy weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge with Liverpool finds the equaliser at the last minute in Chelsea's favour
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League game against Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was passed by Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal to give them a 1-0 lead.
He hit the ball on the side of his left foot before releasing the ball with a long shot.
The attempt flew too high over the box and approached the top right corner of the net.
The ball just took over the jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the final and fell into the net.
"I just wanted to get there, get the ball, and players like Shaq progress as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I gave the ball one little hit and didn't think so much about it and made the back try".
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The lower-order starter passed his shot for the team in the blue-and-black jerseys as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from the midfield and giving a run under Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic gave a pass and quickly walked into the middle of the park.
He threw a beautiful pass through then, which threw Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and took the final shot into the net with his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London, with the match scheduled to start at the end of the day.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly shocked by the scale of the building that was hit by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake last Friday, which generated a wave as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters.
The city of Palu, with a population of 380,000, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55am with blunt force trauma on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come to them.
Cigarette Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'We are early in the investigation but would ask anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have thought of anything with good cameras to contact us as they may have information that would be crucial to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and that she had been found in a property.
Friends of the woman who believe they knew her have come to the scene this evening to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police said they are currently informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left dumbfounded when he learned of what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they are allowed to re-enter.
I heard one policeman telling one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, washing the dishes.
She keeps saying 'this is terrible'.
Two police vehicles were inside the guard line at 2 a.m., with another vehicle just outside.
Several policemen were standing within the guarded line watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention the log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Chromal inside the Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of controversy over the rewriting of history
Its abolition would be a retribution for its Taliban-like complicity in the destruction of many of England's religious cultural treasures at the hands of its fanatic followers or the Puritans as they were christened.
The Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's proposal as a "silly joke" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the statues would expect a real Cromwell Tower outside the Palace of Westminster to be targeted.
It was not Cromail who ordered or committed the outbreak of civil wars in England.
The measures outlined by Thomas in the previous section may be misconceived.
William Hamo Thorneycroft's depiction of a real beauty is a testament to 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a man many believe to be worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps not so much in the 19th century as today, would have thought of Kromail as the protector of parliament against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
The full expression of this is still a matter of historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation ever since, and it is an identifiable individual who acts as the representative of one half of the class.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration".
Chinese farmer viciously attacked by a deadly pig
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs inside a market in south-west Senegal, according to reports in local media.
The man with the surname Yuan was found dead with his artery slashed, and his body covered with blood near a pig's throat at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
A pig farmer preparing to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his four-legged horse from the neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday with 15 pigs sold at the market.
His cousin came in the next morning and found him dead, and found that a door valve with a pig's horn nearby had been blown out.
He said there was a large male pig inside the cows with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the pig had either made a 550 pound violent attack on the farmer or had died, according to the reports themselves.
"My legs were bloody and moldy", said the quadriplegic with the surname Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found around once not a moment ago.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan nor his four horns.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not attack anyone else, and police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly in negotiations over compensation for his death.
There are records of cases of pigs attacking humans, although these are rare.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a British farmer for either pulling him over or for his wife scaring the animal into submission.
After eating his farmer's pig in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that a taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They are only interested in having fun.
They are like you, they are real like animals ... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to show them full respect", he said.
Heavy rain will come predominantly to the southeastern US from the effects of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving over the colder coastline off the northern coast of Mexico.
Floods with Rosa will be felt across northern Mexico and the southwestern US for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had winds of 85 mph as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will be able to fly from the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a cold front is gathering across the Pacific Ocean and will move east toward the US West Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep from the north into the US southeast.
Up to 10 more ferries with Rosa will arrive in parts of Mexico next Monday.
The destructive moisture then interacts with the incoming rain to form heavy rainfall that is widespread in the Far South for a few days.
Between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous mudslides, snowstorms and possibly landslides in the desert.
Extreme deep-sea humidity will cause potential rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches in parts of the Southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
The conditions could rapidly deteriorate due to the diffuse nature of the tropical cyclones.
The decision to go into the desert at the risk of the potential for conflict was a matter of chance.
The heavy rainfall could cause catastrophic flooding of rivers in the estuaries, and the logging storms will be accompanied by local wind gusts and dust storms.
Some rainfall will come with the mud crashing into portions of the southern California coast.
The number of baths could be over half a million, which could generate mini-mining streams and slip roads accordingly.
This is the first rainfall of the region's wet season.
Some of the rainfall patterns of the Arizona-bound tropical cyclones will begin slowly on Sunday and slowly on Monday, before the more extensive rain will slowly spread on Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain will sweep into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Monday.
Sharp fluctuations in temperature can be seen in October across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, with the temperature remaining moderate.
This causes dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
A great example of the amazing variations in temperature across the central USA will be seen on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the last heat of summer will try to rise again.
A warm start to October is predicted for much of the central and western U.S., with temperatures in the 80s widely spreading across the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
80 degrees could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and 10 degrees in and out would be above average temperature.
We are indicating in our long-term forecast that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
No more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition.
More than 20 million people watched the first-person testimony from Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and the woman he accused of sexually assaulting her, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters breaking into a regular check-in for Friday's final: an agreement brokered with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake under the guidance of the FBI to lead an investigation into the changes that would last a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh raped her while he was on the water, and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that no more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
That firm included the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks on display, which included PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have some dislike for measuring the number of people looking into offices.
As a comparative measure, the number of spectators is the same as the number of qualified players in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose host reporters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the way among the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the drama last Friday.
After the moderate Republican candidate issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning receiving a verbal response from leakers while trying to take a stand at the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as they were cast down on him, which was broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone once said to you, "You have the power and the least power that many many women have".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and told him, before the hearing of the petitioner, that he would have further comments at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering the proceedings hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would reveal the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic elite wanted.
It was his conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, that convinced Flake.
It was after a conversation with Coons and a number of senators that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing political games over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing political games over Britain's future and of playing into the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Labour Party Conference in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview close to the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson went on to attack his Brexit plan, or Chequers plan as it is known, saying that the proposal to combine UK and EU tariffs would be "the most far-reaching" proposal.
Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson over death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked into jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers released video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he confessed to Wayde's fatal shooting.
The bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is recognizing the Louisiana State Police's task force on kidnapping, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assisting with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "dedication and determination to bring justice to bear".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch-tall rookie grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne also played baseball with LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was reeling and saddened by Wayde's death.
"That's a matter of concern in an interview", said Wade.
A volcanic eruption brings down a cloud of mud on Mexico City
The mud squeezing from the Popocatepetl volcano has descended on remote areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after activity increased inside the crater, and it recorded 183 gas and plume emissions in a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring multiple mosquitoes and ticks.
Images on social media showed layers of thin lead-coated sheets on the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometres) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the celebration of the independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations to mark the one-year anniversary of Catalonia's secessionist vote.
The police officers were being held back by a yellow-colored beam with eggs and powdered paint, creating a dark cloud of smoke in the streets normally crowded with tourists.
Sneaking also occurred during the day, with the police using their wands to restrain the fight.
The victory for independence was sung by "Dear no, pardon no" in front of united poets chanting "Go for Spain".
Fourteen received medical treatment for minor injuries in the lectures, which was reported by the local press.
Tension remains high in the region where a year-long push for independence comes one year after an October 1 referendum that Madrid deemed illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although the percentage of votes cast by the opposition parties was low.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region with violent car chases.
Pro-independence activists were arrested on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The performance went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the demonstration of the separatists with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We had one of the best moments of our lives last year.
I saw my parents crying with surprise that they could vote, but we are happy now", he said.
Despite the fact that Catalan pro-independence parties won a crucial if not decisive victory in regional elections last December, they have failed to maintain that continuity this year with many of their leaders identified as defectors or detained pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration to support the police on her phone, said it was the politicians on both sides who fuelled the conflict.
"The tension is rising steadily", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed for trial since the end of last year, announced that he would stand in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Competing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to criticise the backsliding of democratic values and the backsliding of the Spanish government", he said.
City of Doom: Men arrested after their house is hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car overturned a house in Doire.
The incident took place on the Churriba Town Square on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Deputy Chief Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
The vehicle may also have been released at some point in time.
A 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers
The first back was by Dolly Menga for Livingston who saved the victory
Livingston had a stunning unexpected victory over Rangers, and it was the second loss for Steven Gerrard in his 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end and Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's side unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season as they face Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will then take on Rapid Wien at home in the Europa League next Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his unbeaten streak to six games, and head coach Holt remains unbeaten since coming on as a substitute for Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not score chances against visiting mothers
Holt's team should have advanced long before they scored, and many difficulties were related to their direct approach to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defending line towards the back but made his attempt across the back mouth, and then Alan Lithgow could only make his attempt in finding after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's headbutt across the back.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play for them, knowing that they would damage the away visitors with the fixed items.
And that's how the back was scored.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston created half-sheans, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who touched the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in possession of the ball at the time, but failed to break the home team's defenses and no one was able to beat striker Liam Kelly,
This continued into the second half, although Kelly had to make a save from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers captain Alan McGregor knocked Scott Pittman out of the gate and Lithgow fought another set with Livingston.
Cross passes came into Livingston's box continuously and were constantly cleared, and two claims for a wrist injury - after Halkett's challenge to agent Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand-wringing - were denied.
'Unbelievable evidence' from Livingston - an analysis of the evidence
Alexander Lamont with BBC Scotland by Tony Macaroni
A proof and an excellent result for Livingston.
All of their players were excellent, exceeding their expectations on that way up.
Their playing style and personnel have changed little since their return to the main squad, but Holt has been a great inspiration since he joined.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett excelled, overseeing the well-organized defenders, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet from the start to the end.
The Rangers have seen a lack of inspiration in the past.
Although they once gave excellent testimony about Gerrard, they came to greatly disregard the standards of the elders.
They missed the final pass - they only broke through the home team once - and it's a kind of eye-opening for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
A blue sky and a tiny moon were seen on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to mend relations between the ECAT allies.
They have been successful on a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdoğan protesters - many of them Kurdish - have also been heard, sharply criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The controversial contrasts are a reflection of the visitor's indifference, with him being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and sharply criticized as a patriot by some who are not.
Road accident in Deptford: Wheel-dead by collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-west of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended the scene, but the man died there.
The incident comes several months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the South End.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to contact his next of kin.
There are road closures and bus diversions, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded during a deadly
Six prison officers were injured during an assault on the men's high security prison, the Prison Office said.
The incident occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" specialists were brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight cyclists and was limited to one cyclist.
The officers were treated for minor injuries to their faces at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: 'A dedicated prison team has been deployed to tackle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
A former crew member was treated for her injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be brought before the police and may be put in jail again".
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, key officers were called in to deal with a serious incident in which staff were attacked with balls.
Tropical Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding targets (which could be damaging to drought-prone areas)
Arizona is rarely faced with a devastating heat wave, but that is likely to happen early next week as a blast of Hurricane Rosa energy is directed over the Northeast Desert, with potential flood risks.
The National Weather Service issued forecasts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and that it will be making a landfall by approaching Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that there have been only ten tropical cyclones that have maintained their tropical storm or hurricane status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Center for the Blind estimate 2 inches to 4 inches of vision, and cut sizes up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
1 to 2 inch is likely to be visible in other areas of the Southwest including the Central Rockies and The Great Basin, and may be complete with up to 4 horns.
For those who are now out of the tulca risk, the Rosa's might be a blessing because the region is dry.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of this potential could be beneficial as parts of the North-East are currently dry.
According to the U.S. Depression Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is directly deforested, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa crossed the Mexican coast of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with a maximum sustained wind of 85 mph, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming over cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and so it's losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico by strong tropical storm late afternoon or Monday night.
The weather across parts of Mexico could be severe, with a significant risk of flooding.
"A meteorological storm is expected to move 3 to 6 hours from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, and could last 10 hours", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then moving through Arizona and into southern Utah slowly Tuesday night.
It is the main expected move from Rosa or its very strong remnants in California, northeastern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert, the National Hurricane Center says.
This farm is expected to produce life-friendly tucks and stream springs, and land clearing in the mountainous country.
Midsomer Norton attacks: Four arrested for attempted suicide
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with his hand on a couple of occasions in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were abducted overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police say.
Officials are appealing to anyone who may have a piece of mobile phone film of what happened to come to them.
Trump said of Kavanaugh that he suffered, in fact, the wrath of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unfair and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered a stroke, and angered the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence at the hearing on her allegation.
President de Saterno said that Americans had witnessed the high standards and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of our most capable legal advisers, a legal scholar with an excellent record of public service", he told the West Virginia delegates.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of a Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not in a rush, and I'm in a rush", he said.
That's why I'm all over the place and I'm fighting for great candidates.
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to deny and obstruct matters.
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the earthquake, Indonesian tsunami and the death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed, and scores were swept away by landslides and waves, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to six metres (18 feet) rolled onto the shore at nightfall, sweeping many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The earthquake occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they didn't immediately move and so they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, boats, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, saying the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edge.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and came back safe, he said.
Some 16,700 people were relocated to 24 sites in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and dilapidated bridges and moss and water all around.
The coastal city continued to be fortified by the De Satern.
The series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the major earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long coastline, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "horrific" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some victims had been found hiding under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the tremors and damage could be more along the periphery 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said there was no information at all in the messages from Donggala.
"There are about 300 000 people living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, saying that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become more, she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not giving the information that the Palu bombs had hit, although officials said a wave had come in within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting and warning people on the street below him of the approaching volcanoes.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water rushes into the shore, engulfing buildings and cars.
The filmmakers were not able to authenticate the piece immediately.
A major power outage caused by the earthquake and tsunami cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but food and other basic necessities are still desperately needed by evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened for pre-flight work only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The Death toll in the Indonesian Tsunami was about 800.
It's that long Holc.
While World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where employees are holed up in messy boxes created in their office's yard, they crossed a roadway, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed", he said.
It's all that hollow.
Even as aid groups began the disaster relief work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and staffing will not flow from overseas until a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
'But it is still a five-level disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can open up for international help but there is no status yet.
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still missing loved ones had hope that their loved ones would be miracles that make the grim events of natural disasters easier to bear.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the cemetery.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been employed as a seamstress for two days and whose mother's body was at her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national para-cycling team, trained two of the para-cyclers who were missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of the other people who were detained at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
'As a nurse in the field of paramedicine, I have an emotional burden myself,' he says.
Mr Gendon spoke of how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse had spread among the news-writing community, he had sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's rivals, who were attending the street festival, as he was leaving his power tower with a bang.
But his messages resulted in only one grey dot, rather than a pair of blue dots.
I think that means that the messages have not been delivered, he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM recharge at Newport on the Levee
Passengers were charged $26,750 Friday morning by a Brink worker who was refilling the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was unloading an ATM in the entertainment centre and preparing to deliver more money, which Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the issue.
While he was busy, another man slipped from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, according to the incident, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The man formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time now and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He will be on the show replacing Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show for "emotional reasons", says the show's creator.
As well as being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West has previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
I believe that ye is the word used the most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you, West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It changed from Kayne, meaning the one person, to Ye - which is a direct reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few rappers who changed their name.
Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy in the past, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z also performed without a flap and without capital letters.
AMLO pledges Mexico not to use the weapon in civil war
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to never use military force in a civil war as the country faces the 50th anniversary of the student-led uprising.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use the gun to oppress Mexicans.
The explosion on October 2, 1968, sparked troops on a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has opposed supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are what attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its AI funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double what it spends on research in that field, said AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the 1st place in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, considering that every other country is much further behind than the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would also double the chances of the next major AI discovery in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the Othello player American high rankings, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has recognized previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visions.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
'China is not driving out academic leaders; it is driving out corporate companies,' Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years have been employed by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost AI efforts as well.
I think that PhDs in AI should be offered a green card automatically", said Lee.
The State Council of China adopted its Development Plan for the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Committee on Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an Intelligence Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in recent months in US legislation to create a National Security Commission on Civilian Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change its name to 'Republic of North Macedonia', a measure to resolve a twenty or thirty year-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from applying for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose peninsula is called Macedonia, claims its neighbour's name to the north as a claim to its territory and has blocked its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but rival nationalist parties argue that the change would take away the ethnic identity of the Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign of bribery has raised doubts whether or not the number of voters will reach the 50 per cent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece?'
The people who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worthwhile to look at entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
'I came today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the shadow of the European Union because it means a safer life for us all,' said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would wait for the outcome of the vote to be decided.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required for a name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent turned out to vote, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
'I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe', said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on changing the name of the country to settle its path to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of a crowd of people who will be attending the referendum.
"We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we would like to accept membership with pride, and not through the service door", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that there will be a very large majority in favour because over 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a vote in favour would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required voting turnout.
In another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Televison Telma, 57 respondents were found to have intended to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
For the referendum to be successful, a majority of 50 percent must vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's pro-Western policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero Manchester City make their way through all the defenders Brighton for a back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in a 2-0 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal was all but easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine centre forward got a pass at the centre of the park at the start of the series.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders, before shortly entering the open park.
There were four green lines around Aguero then.
He pushed around one defender before running over a few other defenders on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then pressed a pass on his left side, reaching Sterling.
England's starter used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg to take the victory over Brighton defender Matthew Ryan with a punch into the right hand of the goalie.
"Aguero has some problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing it for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a back at that moment.
But it was Steirling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League.
That back was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's ground on that play.
He threw a beautiful ball along the left foot to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before Sterling led to the back of the net.
Sky Blues' starter hit the ball into the corner before slipping over the boundary.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer would play spoiler towards Rockies
With the Nazis eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another start.
But the perennially competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the lead Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are game-fixing implications for the Rockies, who are leading by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the WL West.
The Rockies won at least a special berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking to win a first division title.
Even if we're playing without a reason, at least we'll be able to put our foot down in the series three games and know that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point that would be in front of me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that?
The Nationals still have a starter to announce for Saturday, but they are said to let Scherzer pitch in a case like this usually.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, would practice Thursday's practice session and would be pitching his usual Sunday shoe.
The Washington native is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump sweeps in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the case of his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of a Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done will be at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not in my race but I'm really in my race and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates", she said.
Trump then said, "You see this radical group of grains, these grains, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to bring back the power by using all the necessary means, you see the grace, the rarity.
They don't care who they hurt, who they put in power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
It is the Democrats' mission to reject and block events.
And you see that for the last four days, he said, he's been bringing fear and tears and anger and lies to the Democrats.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee classifying Sen. Dianne Feinstein's candidacy with his name, and the audience applauded him loudly.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
I didn't leak, uh no, I'm waiting for one - that body marking was all bad - the worst body marking I've ever seen.
The Labour Party and the wider church are no longer the same.
They have no take with those who speak out
Although the Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour Party Members to be told that we are not welcome - that's all we talked about.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same way because of her strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the secret criticism I received was for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, issues Jeremy has, ironically, disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting specified that 'we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive'.
For most of my six years as a local Labour Member, this was exactly how the Friday AG meetings were.
Unfortunately, today, in many of the meetings, that is not the atmosphere and the promise of a genuine European politics has long since been forgotten, let alone ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different views in the Labour party and all opinions are considered on whether it is accepted by the party leadership or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought we shared a similar political outlook expected me to make a fundamental change and take positions with which I would otherwise disagree - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Anytime I speak in public - and no matter what I say - there will be a barrage of bad actors on social media calling for a re-election, criticizing the party's politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And this is not just an experience.
In fact, I know that I am more popular than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually about politics.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who have to put up with a barrage of sexual or racist abuse every day without backing down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the way in which levels of evil are now being accepted.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are not that broad church anymore and with every 'self-immolation' resolution or change in selection rules the party is getting smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years advising me not to draw attention to myself, not to speak out so much and then we'll be right.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, inspired by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my school's busy classroom falling to the ground at home, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
It would not help if anyone in Nottingham East was confused by my policy stance and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is gearing up for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But in fact my only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that neither threats of disqualification nor political pressure will stop me from acting in a way that is in the interests of you all.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes undefeated to the top
Two bad guys may have put the final score on the line, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the all-important Tennants Premier League game that day.
They're now at the top of the table, the only team out of ten that hasn't been beaten.
In the end, it was their excellent defence, combined with their chances, that helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie was right to be pleased.
"We have tried our best so far, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy", she said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "With Ayr's praise, they took better chances than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but, due to a yellow card from Albanian player Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the net and Jason Baggot will take an unprotected goal.
Ayr's first goal came with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then he jumped a leg-to-leg to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with Patrick Anderson's touch, which saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Knott's wheel, which was taken off the park on a stretch, and from the start, Ayr's forward push was driven by Stafford McDowall's own, who stepped in Climo.
Active Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card there, and again, Melrose gave the extra man a pay-off to Bruce Colvine's unprotected skin at the end of a furious thrust.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, from stretching out the penalty kick, MacPherson collapsed at the back of Ayr's knee moving forward.
Climo, as he had been doing since the resumption almost, collapsed after Kyle Rowe's high-pitched over his shoulder picked up David Armstrong and put forward forward defender Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth-place finish.
It seems that the stars of Still Game are going to have a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he has been named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford, 56, has a role as Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes with and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that their upcoming new series will be the last one during the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in a successful Glasgow restaurant business.
The sea is our home: Bolivia's tailwinds hope the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval headquarters equipped with rigs in La Paz.
Public buildings are surrounded by a wall of ash.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the flag: Nine is the sea from the right.
It is our duty to get her back.
Across Bolivia, memories of the victories against Chile in the bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century are still fresh - as is the return of the Pacific Fleet.
The hope is the greatest in the last 20 or 30 years, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a spirit of unity and solidarity and is obviously looking forward to the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolavach will be watching the CBI's control of the big screens across the country, and will be disappointed that the Hague bench will be in favour of Bolaive's claim - after the corrupt talks of the last twenty or thirty years - that it is Chile's duty to negotiate and give Bolaive a dominant position in the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's embattled indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year - is also deeply concerned about Monday's rule.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Bolivia - and little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to grant Chilean citizenship, and has ordered that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ILO's ruling comes six months after the final arguments have been heard shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Silesian expert in international law.
And not only has the Bolaive case been put forward, but it may have been put back in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken a stand on the issue of access to the sea", said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive propaganda made good-will to any left by Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was more subtle than usual.
It will be a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile on Monday and a chance to end 139 years of agreements with common partners, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most hated Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
The control is to show that we have to overcome the history.
North Korea said that nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons in the first place unless it has confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the warring parties.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that had been stalled for more than three months following a Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a fear that continued sanctions and the US refusal to declare an end to the North Korean War would leave the North in a nightmare.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes the first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump would like to have another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is in fact undergoing a reversal of fortunes that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
The latest line in the fashion shows in Paris is shown in huge deals that are on the way to the High Street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or to block the sun altogether, no further search is necessary.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a huge range of headliner pieces for their SS19 collection on the exhibition stage with a stylistic effect that was set at Paris Fashion Week.
A lot of very unpractical hats were showing up on Instagram this summer and these designers put their incredible work on the platform in a few minutes.
The prominent piece by Valentino is a superb hat with a broad leaf like a whip that has struck the monkeys' claws.
Other giant accessories included jewelled water bowls, a magic hat and even a bow - but they were not designed to keep your skull warm.
Thom Browne revealed a strange mask selection also in time for November.
Many of the masks had hairy lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One work resembled scuba gear, with snorkels and swimming glasses, and another resembled a can of melted ice cream.
And if you follow the statement of the enormous faun - you are lucky.
It is predicted by style observers that the big, long-lost boots may be making their way to the main streets near you.
The giant hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the two-leafed, double-turned-leaf hat seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The back of the very impractical hat that was being shown across social media has put another big work on the canvas - a beach rug that is almost as big as the canvas on which the bony lizard is carrying it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, which had a raffia french trim and white leather straps, was the featured piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera Paris Fashion Week collection SS19.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags to come to the main street for next summer - since the designer had so many influences it would be hard to ignore the huge decorations".
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
The independent schools of the Netherlands maintain a proven record of academic excellence, which was followed in 2018 by another series of excellent examination results, which are reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30 000 pupils across the Alps, these schools, represented by the Albanian Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for the profession of their choice and for their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector where we can design and implement school-tailored curricula, we are seeing modern languages become popular and a desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest examination results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A Honours degree.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved an A-Level Honours in Mandarin, while 72 per cent who studied German, 69 per cent who studied French and 63 per cent who studied Spanish also achieved an A-Level.
This shows that independent schools in Albania are supporting foreign languages as a vital skill for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now seen as subject options, as are STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for having difficulty filling vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With languages being required for more prospective job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future of having a lifelong skill like this one.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically promotes a multilingual person to the competitive position.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language with a negative percentage of two digits, 15 per cent.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language teaching.
If children speak more than one language, especially those in developing economies, they are more likely to find meaningful employment.
Different languages are taught in all schools within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on the contemporary and classical languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important languages for the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
The Albanian independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable that in today's globalised business environment, languages are still very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, languages should be seen as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Albania.
I'll be with you.
John Edward is the Director of the Albany Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego
The wait is about to be over for fans to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-week Lakers preseason schedule.
I don't have pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare for.
Trump's time in West Virginia was canceled, You Tube channel
President Donald Trump begins some of the festivities tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five trips over the coming week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to retain his Supreme Court nominee, Trump plans to gain support for the midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of the Federal Parliament, when votes are called on November 2.
What time will West Virginia's Trump rally take place tonight and how can we watch it online?
The Trump inauguration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump impeachment in West Virginia can be watched live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak about the ongoing hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.The hearing was tense over allegations of sexual misconduct.The Senate confirmation vote has been postponed for one week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of the series of lectures next week is to help Republicans, who face stiff competition, to accelerate their campaign.
So President Trump's campaign has indicated that these five deployments over the coming week were aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress' discipline is so essential to its agenda that the president will visit as many states as he can as the campaign season gets underway", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The West Bank Stadium in Wheeling is scheduled to host the game tonight and could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh, according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the President is coming to try to push through the elections", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup Team USA show a desire to be optimistic ahead of Sunday's singles rounds.
After three one-sided sessions, the Ryder Cup may have been the thing that this Ryder Cup needed.
Speed is a well-established sporting concept, but the players strongly believe in it, especially at competitions like this.
So where is the momentum now, they say?
"We had six points up and now it's down to four points, so we're a little bit behind", said Jordan Spieth as he played for the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, with four points ahead and 12 to go.
The Americans are hopeful, however, and have a very hopeful cause, especially as Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, during the day and can claim to have won three points out of four.
Spieth is playing great from home to the net and is setting a good example.
The goal scorer's goal became higher as the round progressed; he scored a goal necessary to win game four, when he and Thomas were two to finish after two holes.
The goal he got beat the game at 15 and the cards were left, the kind that tells you the American team has not lost the competition.
"You have to keep your courage and focus on your own game", said Spieth.
That's what every player has left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the two days played are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of Corn Ryder.
The European pair has four wins out of four, they are all happy and can do nothing wrong.
The Moliwoods were the only pair not to hit boxes on Saturday afternoon, but avoided boxes, as well as Saturday morning, Friday evening and the second nine of Friday morning.
Their impeccable play and the way they draw energy from the glamorous crowd make them the two players who must win on Sunday; and no player would be more determined to win a European title by going under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them took the win out at the same time, but at different holes.
But it is too early to talk about European glory.
It did not take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to defeat Sergio Garcia, the women's four-ball hero, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spaniards and the Swans were stuck in a hole and could not escape after receiving a double and a two-double in the opening nine holes.
But in the end, there is no one to help you escape the pit you've sunk yourself into.
The four balls and the four-hand game are equally attractive, if viewed closely, because of the interplay between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way in which strategy changes in the eye's eye.
Europe have been the best team to this point and they are leading well going into the final day, but this quarter-final game showed that Team USA have a fighting spirit, although some people, especially in the United States, were skeptical.
Europe are leading 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good head start on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four-ball and four-way play, when they lead the United States 10-6.
The exciting duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were leading the pack when they had two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to take the four points to that point at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the crown, which they had lost to Hazeltine two years ago to win again, against the American team who were losing, had the upper hand in the four balls.
The American team was very strong in the four balls; they won two games but were unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles to keep the crown.
Fleetwood is the first European golfer to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who was christened Molliwood after a weekend breakthrough, are the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
They had a great victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and defeated two as a unit to win over the weakened Woods and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled in two games on Saturday, has shown a lot of promise but has now lost 19 of 29 games he has played in the four balls and in the quarter-finals and has now lost seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose took a break during the morning four-ball and played his partner, Henrik Stenson, again in the quarter-finals and won 2 and 1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world.
Europe, however, has not had an easy day, driven south by Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the main event three times, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for the Americans when they won two points on Saturday.
They took the decisive victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and subsequently came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four-balls, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the singles competition, although the Furyk team only need to score to retain the crown, having won the crown last year.
However, after being in second place for two days, they are unlikely to be able to counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is no chance of unilateral disarmament because of a lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were adding to their distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons, which it had, unilaterally, in this case.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had shown "very good faith" over the past year, in that it stopped nuclear and missile tests, halted nuclear tests and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we do not see any similar response from the United States to this.
Without any trust from the United States, our national security will not be reliable and in these circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm, first of all.
Although Ri again made North Korea's common complaint about the United States, which opposed a "gradual" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given a reprieve as it took small steps, his statement was significant in that he did not renounce a purely unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a dialogue between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States, still in office, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards achieving nuclear disarmament for North Korea as long as Trump promised the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected requests to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States supports nuclear disarmament in the first place and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve their objective in a concerted way, and even opposes declarations of war, he said.
The idea that sanctions can hold us back is the idea of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which continue, are adding to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no mention of another summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader had mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and also said: "If South Korea had been the party to this nuclear disarmament issue instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of North Korea would not have been like this".
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's rockets would inevitably be directed at the US mainland after Trump, "Mr Evil President", called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, despite threatening last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, but said that much work still needed to be done and sanctions would be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for disarmament, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must be applied firmly and without fail until full nuclear disarmament is achieved and certified".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made; but North Korea fired him within a few hours because he demanded a truce as a camel would.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a missile site, if the United States took corresponding measures.
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security promises given by Trump in Singapore and taking steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough fuel.
A new course is being launched at Harvard University this year to give all undergraduates extra sleep to counter the growing, night-time culture of studying with the help of caffeine.
A scholar found that students at the university, which is the first in the world, have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put the course together and believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, 'Why wasn't this told to me before, when I was in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time this year, explains to students the key points of good sleeping habits and how they help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university took the decision to introduce the course when it found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
A series of interactive tasks are part of the one-hour course.
One section contains images of shuanlios, in which students lean on coffee cups, cups, training shoes and books to answer questions about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of a regular sleep schedule.
In another section, people who take part in the way that prolonged sleep deprivation can be done are told about the increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then creates, the participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you would have a right to know about the health effects of smoking on you", Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of the greatness of sitting in one's chair at night is still there, he said.He added that modern technology and the ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Students should ensure that they have a good quality sleep as a secret tool, he said, to avoid stress, diarrhoea and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation, as it is regularly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and that it inspired him to seek the course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the undergraduates to do the same kind of study programme, before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Gerrard's men's team is backed by Menga
Rangers lost again at home as, due to the back injury suffered by Menga, Steven Gerrard's migration team were beaten 1-0 by Livingston.
The match was a shock for the club, as the home side were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but were beaten by Gary Holt, Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, and Gerrard's side are eight points clear of Hearts, the team with a big lead in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and it was unlikely that Rangers, who lacked inspiration, would be able to score.
While Rangers have fallen to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third and is only back from back.
Rangers could be in for more trouble, after the man of the line, Calum Spence, received a medical for a head injury from some matter thrown from the side of the crowd out of town, according to pictures.
Gerrard made eight substitutions on the team that easily beat Ayr to secure a place in the semi-final of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt retained the same 11 player, who took a point from Hearts the previous week and would have been very pleased with the way in which his team had tackled the well-trained opponent's wife.
The Rangers may have had possession of the ball for the most part but Livingston was more interested in the possession they found.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who gave a kick towards the back of Allan McGregor but went on a forehand.
Keegan Jacobs took a free kick that went to captain Craig Halkett but his defending partner Alan Lithgow failed to take his kick but to put it on the board.
Rangers took control of the game, but seemed to have more hope than faith in the type of play they were playing, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had a deserved kick after quarter time, when he beat out Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson refused Columbia's man's pleas.
Rangers managed to put only two chicks towards the back but Ibrox's former full-back Liam Kelly had no difficulty breaking Lassana Coulibaly's head and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi may have been in the 34th minute against the pattern of the season, there is no denying that they did not deserve it because they made an excellent effort.
The Rangers again failed to deal with a steady item in the starting lineup from Jacobs.
Scot Arfield did not respond to a pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave a pass to Menga, who put him in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change had an immediate impact as he passed to Morelos, who hit him towards the back but pushed Kelly, who had a great game, from his line to cross the ball.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors to play the kind of game they liked.
Holt's team could have scored an extra run towards the end of the game but McGregor stood well enough to beat Jacobs and Lithgow took the lead from a corner that went to the forehand.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a late claim of irony when he had an argument with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, looked the other way.
Almanac: founding Director Geiger.
And now a page from our German newspaper Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today .......the day that the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Hans  Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery from which the device known as the Geiger Assertor was derived.
The Geiger counter has long been a cornerstone of science, and has also become a cornerstone of pop culture. In the 1950s, a movie starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, although not expected, was made as scientists in the film:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger Counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can hear the effects of the radiation released from the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's certainly plaguing now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the name of the invention still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect cancer cells.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize inflamed cells as part of a medical regimen.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then check for proteins that are common in many fats and then be reinjected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one case, women who received a course of treatment with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system how to recognize malignant cells, had their ovarian cancer completely cured for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can 'test' proteins common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: 'Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that is very reliable.'
'Some cancers develop from HER2, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked where immune cells were taken from a patient and taught how to target cancer cells to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West started to make out for Trump, wearing a MAGA Hat after being on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was praised in the studio after Saturday Night Live after delivering a release show in which he praised the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for office in 2020, he said.
When he sang the third song called Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat. He began to rant against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person who says, "How could you give Trump a ring, not a ring?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America long ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a magic sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not air, comedian Chris Rock uploaded a clip of Kanye West on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make a joke about West with the post.
In addition, viewers had complained that he was being insincere about the headwear he was wearing.
They bullied me in the backstage.
They said, "Don't throw that hat on you then".
They bullied me!
And then, they say I'm in a low place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" He said "I'll put a Superman hat on it because that means you can't give me orders. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try for love.
He was booed at least twice for things he said and appeared to be embarrassed by staff members, Variety reported; one person told the magazine; "The whole studio was in his pocket".
West was cast in the program as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West assembled a crowd for a performance of the song "I Love it" while dressed as Beaudelle Perrier.
The leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner supported West in a tweet: "To one of the most misogynistic people: Thank you for standing up to the masses".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Kanye West was gay as he is and that's great.
But I choose not to compensate someone (to buy their music or support their art) who, in my opinion, is embracing and promoting an ideology that harms my own people.
It's free.
We, too, are on a mission.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his official name was now Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and he follows Diddy's example, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, as well.
His fellow rap musician, Snoop Dogg, has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, Prince, who doesn't live, changed his name to Symbol and then to the artist who already called him Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a pub in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a pub in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Hackamar Town, police said.
The defence counsel is expected to appear before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office shall examine the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks the manhood of a sword.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy-adventure series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has criticised stereotypes of the heroic, saying that such parts on the screen often make young boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of male masculinity in the era of "MeToo".
Kit, who is married to fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, 31, also recently admitted that he feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
 Personally, I feel strongly at the moment - where did we go with masculinity? he said.
What lessons have we taught men as they grew up, in terms of the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television may be responsible, in part, for the increase in male masculinity, thanks to the extremely masculine characters.
He continued: What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets tells young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in pre-novels or continuing stories when the series ends next summer, saying that he would no longer have horse and cat parks.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West Sam Shepard, a story about a filmmaker and his brother, who is a ghost.
The actor recently stated that he felt that the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show and, as such, it gave me my children and my future life", he said.
Rose Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow, fell in love with her in the fantasy series, which won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
The European Union is also considering a number of measures to help the country's economy, including the establishment of a new healthcare system, the introduction of new health insurance systems, and the introduction of a new health insurance system.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say that the disease affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were spread through sex, a change from the previous situation.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China, due to the over-transmission of infected people.
But the number of people getting HIV like this has fallen dramatically and, hardly, anyone is getting it now, said Chinese medical officials in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sex is a pressing issue in China's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community.
The de-construction of homosexuality in China was enacted in 1997, but it is said that prejudice against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies show that 70%-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Much of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is deficient in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV drugs available to the general public in an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters claims that GOP staff leaked data of senators and criticizes "dissenting lies and conspiracy theories".
Representative Maxine Waters has complained to the Court of allegations that a member of her own staff leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the staff member posted the information on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat suggested that the information was being promoted by right-wing commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel examining allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made available sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Archival sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified the posts as related to Waters' office and that the information about a Waters staff member was provided by the Hill.
"This allegation is completely false", Waters continued.
The staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This accusation, which has no foundation, is completely false.
The statement was immediately criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she is not fit to be a Member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
You should not be challenging.
It should not question the motives of the offender.
He should be calm and relaxed.
The similarity was that Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too cowardly during Friday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro is standing in the election to win Waters' seat in the midterm elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
It is a great thing, if it is true, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that those guilty of the crime are exposed, she continued, and held accountable for their actions, which are written and accessible to all members of staff.
Johnny English is in Business Again - a spy spy thriller by Rowan Atkinson with no effective points.
It is now traditional to look at whether the importance of Britishness is in any new film that has a British bias and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which involves action-thriller in comic form.
Will self-restraint of the language in the crowd, as fearful as we are, be a new export opportunity for the nation?
However, Johnny English with the bulging eyes has once again been given a licence to make a joke of things. As his name suggests, he is a comic character created for the people who attend the cinema in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the secret agent, the sea-footed, the high-flying, the delusional, but Clouseau-like, Mr Bean-and-the-man who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is based from the beginning on the traveller and the international man, a mystery that Atkinson took part in the television advertisements of the time Barclaycard, but is now forgotten in that he left everything in his home country behind.
There are some nice points in this movie, the latest JE.
I was very sad to see Johnny English walking towards the helicopter while he is dressed in a medieval knight's cap and the rotors hitting against his cloak by one point.
Atkinson's love of body comedy is evident, but the comedy is particularly lazy and overblown, as action film brands such as James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as part of their films.
The comedy seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's seafaring myths are not as fresh and focused as Atkinson's silent film comedy in the form of Mr Bean.
The point is that Britain has a big problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the secret network of British spies and the names of British agents have been leaked, giving the agent in charge an exclusion - a very small part, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
The tragic blow to the principal, a serious, stressed-out person; already, the public's reaction to him is a complete failure: Emma Thompson does her best with the character, who is similar to Teresa-May, but can do little with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that the names of all spies are leaked and that she must find someone who is out of the loop.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He's employed, for the moment, in a shady place, but he's giving lessons, in a secret way, about how to be an undercover agent. There's some humor here because English's proposal is to provide a Roc-Choiel-type spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his old partner, Bough, who is Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a minor party politician, and an excessively Vicki Pepperdine-like character.
So Batman and Robin, who find everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action. They meet Ophelia Bulletova, an attractive, beautiful woman, who takes the part.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being targeted by a tech-mad billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin a pleasurable and elegant act: dressed as waiters, they serve French fried chicken by the fire; they create a spell of victory while secretly boarding the Volta's chicken boat; English creates a riot, when he tries to use the Real Starlight headset to inform the interior of Volta's house.
They do their best for the final paragraph, but although it is satisfying and meaningful, the look of the children's TV is all the matter.
A rather modest thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I had this idea: could the British film industry bring in Rowan Atkinson, who is a fitting fit?
The Labour Party says it is planning a four-day working week for British workers but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which Britons will work four days a week, but be paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the bodies to give money, which they will save through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI), to the workers in the form of extra days off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still be paid the same.
Sources said the idea would be a boost to the party's economic programme and plans to turn the country in favour of workers.
The Conference of Craftsmen has agreed to the four-day working week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is the target, which suits the party's approach to giving the worker an advantage and the party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first group to have agreed to that idea, as the Green Party did during the campaign in the 2017 General Election.
The Labour Party, however, does not generally agree with the current target.
The Labour Party spokesman said: 'The party's policy is not a four-day work week and the party is not being considered.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference to express his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from 'anonymous directors' and from the profit-making interests of utility bodies.
The Chancellor's plans mean that existing shareholders in the water bodies will not get their full share as the Labour government could pay a rebate, on the grounds that something has gone wrong.
It also confirmed plans to give workers seats on company boards and to create a Universal Ownership Fund and to give 10% of the company's shares to employees, who are entitled to an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy with 60 Minutes, asks whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week, due to an FBI inquiry into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. It raises the question of the bureau's decision and whether or not Republican senators could change their minds and support the Judge.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could get any information they wanted about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina colleagues.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I'm going into the hearing, I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this, the accused will be called out and the accuser asked, 'What did you do?'
He was firm, firm, he didn't put teeth in it.
However, it seems that Graham's vote is certain.
"I've made up a story about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a serious allegation", he said.
'Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett is a permanent resident,' said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she named can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change it.
What is the World Citizen's Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This week, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual event with a host of big stars and a mission of the utmost importance: to end global poverty.
This will be the seventh year of the World Citizens' Day and thousands of people will be drawn to the Great Wall in Central Park to enjoy the music of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as to draw attention to the event's ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012 and is an international advocacy project that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the concert-goers had to do a number of tasks, or 'actions' such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a voice call or using any other useful means to spread information about their aim to end poverty.
How successful was Global Citizen with 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it really a way of giving free concerts as gifts to people to get them to take action, or is it just another example of how click-bait-people think they are making a real difference when they sign online petitions or tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, seeking to promote various causes.
He says these actions have helped to persuade world leaders to make pledges and promote policies worth over $37 billion that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money received has already directly impacted the lives of 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and people who make pledges, is committed to helping children develop their capabilities and pledging a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 votes from Global Citizens.
'With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice of malnutrition' said Tracy Ullman, Food Power's ambassador, to the crowd at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children to intervene in nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, which asks the question  why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: 'We have a long, difficult road ahead - from time to time, we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the future, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
The musicians who will be participating in this year's event, in New York, include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe. It will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to stage a coup to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use the Navy if necessary to stop Russian energy from being sold in markets, including the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's presence in Syria, as it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
'I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to settle for energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe.' he said.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
'The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes are kept open, and if necessary, to conduct expeditions, to ensure that their energy is not available on the market,' he said.
Zinke was speaking to those present at the event, which was hosted by the Consumers' Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that claims to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same.
The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to influence and change fuels, more or less, he said. He referred to Russia as a "pioneer of any industry that relies heavily on fossil fuels".
The rumours come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the ill-conceived Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, according to Trump, have made Moscow's withdrawal from Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is an economic project that will increase the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is strongly opposed, for economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
I think we agree that fuel cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after his meeting with the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
Germany has reacted to the US position and has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Confederation of German Industry (German Confederation of Industry) (CTG), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, leader of the Confederation of German Industry (CTG) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Carefully" consider running for President in 2020, says the Senator from Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "look carefully" at running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running in the race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government and then consider a woman in charge", she said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will be watching closely the progress of the presidential race.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about the effect of Donald Trump on our democracy", she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said he was sure we would have an FBI investigation before we voted.
A referendum held on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported her to stand in the election.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick had the most support, with 38 percent supporting him to stand and 48 percent opposing him.
Democrats, who were in the public eye discussing a position for the presidency in 2020, included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (NSI), which is Palin's track, while cheering for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested by police on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
'My own son has suffered since he came back and I can understand the difficulties other families have with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I understand the trauma of soldiers being wounded and the disease draining them,' she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that no one wants to talk about her arrest and said that because of her son and other war veterans, "they come back and they're different, they're tough, they come back and they doubt that the public respects what their fellow veterans and their colleagues and all the other members of the military have done, what they've done for their home country".
He was taken on the Lookout in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence assault of a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to minorities fleeing violence related to drugs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a complaint in a friend of the court's oath on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker, who was denouncing the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the legal case, Grace v. Sessions, was not named, which was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said she was abused by her partner and her violent son, who is a member of a gang, but U.S. officials refused to accept her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys, who were supporting Grace, said El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom seek asylum in the United States, were nations with chronic problems with drought and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants, fleeing domestic violence, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "brings together twenty or thirty years of state law, federal law, and international law".
According to federal law, each asylum claim must be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and the current ban undermines this principle, the court's friend said.
Lawyers further argued that the policy, which barred immigrants, harmed the US economy; they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to provide a much-needed workforce.
In June, Attorney-General Jeff Sessions ordered a temporary detention order without asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and mob violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries because of fear or intimidation about their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinions", Sessions said in his policy statement on 11 June.
It was never intended that a sanctuary would solve every problem - even the most difficult - that people face every day around the world.
Despite the desperate efforts made in Palu, the death toll doubles in the race to reach the survivors.
The situation was becoming more dire for the survivors.
"I feel the tension", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her little boy, who was suffering from fever, at a displacement centre in the city of Palu, which had been burned to the ground.
Every minute a patient brings in a hearse.
Clean water is scarce.
Settlers were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scrambling through wet personal belongings; they were looking for anything that was available to save.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to deal with it.
Several of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken hip and shoulder, were allowed to rest outside the Arm Palu Hospital as medical attention was being given to the sick, as powerful aftershocks were still continuing.
The deer were with him as he spoke of the terrible earthquake, which shook the guest room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
"The wall was pushed in, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that his children were in the big city for a wedding.
I heard my wife begging for help, but then everything was in a mess.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, safe.
The United States ambassador to China is making a publicity stunt with a propaganda ad.
A week after China's official newspaper placed a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the United States, the US ambassador to China tweeted that Beijing was using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
The United States: On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in Iowa - paid for by the China Daily - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusation showed that Beijing was seeking to interfere with the U.S. election a new stage in a campaign, which Washington is escalating to put pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently mired in an escalating trade war and, as a result, have both imposed tariffs on their imports.
China imposed tariffs early in the trade war to strike a blow against states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, which exports many agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is taking advantage of this corruption by placing propaganda ads in American free newspapers. Branstad wrote an article that reflected his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
The Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom to spread its propaganda, when it advertises, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, you won't hear many dissenting voices at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, and you won't see the different opinions the Chinese public may have on China's economic policy, which is biased, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He continued: "One of the major Chinese newspapers offered to publish his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women voters out of the door ahead of the midterm elections in the Kavanaugh case, according to Analysis.
As many major Republicans stand aside while defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially from women during the midterm elections, is on the horizon.
People are very concerned about this and most Republicans have already said they want to go ahead with the vote.
"These things cannot be canceled", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether there would be enough effort from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), who tried at the last minute to get an FBI investigation to satisfy disenchanted voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the advocacy group MoveOn, on Friday, before the news in Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Republicans, who controlled the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic 2.
The Democrats' ambitions will be greatly increased and will always be very encouraging,' said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news site.
People are saying it's high, already; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women in the two councils, in the suburbs and among younger voters, people aged 18 to 29 who do not like the President but who do vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which presented her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be a backlash if Republicans moved forward to confirm the nominee.
"This is a fundamental mistake for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether or not Kavanagh is appointed, it's also about the way Republicans deal with this and the way they're elected", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who will believe Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's testimony, and who will believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or completely believe Ford's testimony and 35 percent of respondents said they fully or completely believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed, completely or almost completely, that Kavanaugh had lied in his testimony while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake's press release, the FBI is investigating the allegations Ford made, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez testified that her genetic makeup was revealed by the Supreme Court when they attended a concert while both were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who invented the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is about to launch a new initiative that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technologist, Inrupt, is a body building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where they store their data, and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the goal of Inrupt is to "globally disrupt".
"We have to do it now", he said of the initiative.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create a personal data store, online or create a POD.
It can contain contact details, to-do lists, a calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and all available at the same time.
The specific feature of the online personal data repository is that it is about the user only giving access to a person, who has a specific type of information.
The body shall enable the personal data to be processed.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to Chief Executive John Bruce, is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers on the team, who are contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said neither he nor his team were talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete overhaul where their business models would have overnight base-top conversions.
We are not seeking your permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt was a way of providing commercial and eco-scale energy to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet, when he founded the World Wide Web Corporation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past several months, an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality has been Berners-Lee.
Even as he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the internet", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the Victoria Cross in World War I is held under the clergy.
The only musician to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier has been celebrated in his home town by a Church of England clergyman.
Lieutenant-Colonel, The Honourable Bernard Vann, won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest rank in the British army.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his sons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said that it was "a great symbol" that the stone had been unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette of 28 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin at three heavy checks and under heavy attack from field guns and machine guns.
He then rose to the line of the shooters and with great courage led the line before riding on his own and putting three out of the penalty.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German submarine on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but that goes to my heart".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, set up a flower shop behind the parade, which was the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was a great honour to take part in the parade and that the support of many people was a true hero's courage.
IMMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been sitting up all night watching Bellator 206, which is packed to the rafters but you don't get to watch the main event.
The fight featured 13 fights from San Jose, six from the main event and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to tackle each other, a stunt was pulled from UK audiences when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not too excited after they had stayed in their seats until the early afternoon to watch the fight.
One follower described the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
"It was a government regulation that the programme was not suitable and, therefore, they had to change it to a children's programme", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice-president in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the Pig, that's who.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage to UK viewers in the future.
'I think, when I think about the re-fight, that we can work it out,' said Coker.
But it is six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work this out until this time on Sunday and that time on Monday.
But we're trying to fix it.
Believe me, when the programme changed over there, many texts were going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We've chosen five rounds instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to give the fans too much and too much time.
It is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "out of control" because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says that he felt he was not as good as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that it gave him the motivation to make progress.
The 24-year-old says that it was not until he went to secondary school that he realised that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that, now that he was a parent, winning at the Olympics was not as important to him.
The regular guest on the show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
While first portraying Laverne as a man on a deserted island, Daley said that he viewed himself as less than everyone else, as he was growing up as "not socially accepted that boys and girls would like one another".
He said: 'To this day, it is those feelings that have made me feel less and different, it is those things that have given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things.'
He wanted to show that he was worth something, he said, so that when he finally came out, he would not disappoint everyone.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games is now a public-spirited campaigner for LGBT people, and he took advantage of his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without implication and wanted to give hope to others.
Daley, a three-time world champion, said he was inspired to become a goat when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was last year but said there had never been any problem with the gap.
"When you suffer so much at a very young age" - he went to the Olympics, initially, when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had so much upside down in his life.
The couple have been parents since June, and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who Daley said has changed his whole outlook on life.
"If you asked me last year what was important, it was all about winning gold medals", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - as he wanted to be in the starting line-up.
"I couldn't tell you weren't going to be around to be in the starting lineup, Dad", he said.
'I was holding him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit he was ill until he stopped breathing and was dead,' he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was my life's dream - to swim in front of a hometown crowd at the Olympics, couldn't feel better", he said.
He also inspired his first song choice - Proud with Heather Small - which he took to heart in the build-up to the Olympics and still cherishes.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not properly functioning on the bench of representatives in Ryder's Corner, was called to the bench.
The American, Phil Mickelson, will be the man of the match on Sunday when he plays in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but he will have to improve his game if he does not want it to be a disappointing one for him.
Mickelson was sent to the representative bench for the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday by captain Jim Furyk.
Despite being in the middle of the action, as was often the case for the United States, Mickelson, who had five major tournament victories, spent his time as a recommended goalkeeper and practicing his play on the field hoping he could solve any problem that was bothering him.
The 48-year-old is not a perfect fit for Le Golf National, as the long-distance course regularly throws off stray balls.
And if the course itself isn't hard enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will be competing against British Open round-robin Francesco Molinari, whose partner is Tommy Fleetwood, who is in his first year of playing and has all four of his matches won this week.
If the Americans get off to a good start, which is four points to finish at the top of the 12 singles, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he trusted him, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the part he had here today, he gave me a compliment and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He is very confident.
He is someone who has had a very good reputation in the past, and he has put that to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't dream of him playing two games.
I dreamed more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going to go.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's quiz to the person who has played the most games on the Dutchman.
It could signal the end of a regime that was never as good as his personal aspiration.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said there were some things he missed for the team because of his presence.
"He is funny, helpful, outgoing, likes to make fun of people and is a great person in the team room", he explained.
I think the young sports players were also very excited to see it this week.
It offers more than the play.
Thomas Bjorn understands that a large horse can go quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a good start to the final day of the singles in the Ryder Cup can make for a difficult day.
The Danes made their debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, as a team under their captain, Seve Ballesteros, were five points ahead of the Americans but had to settle for the narrowest gap, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big win at Valderrama; we had a big win at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely", said Bjorn, pictured after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone else that this is not over.
Immigrants are 100 percent tomorrow.
Then go out and do the right things.
This is not about having the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this corner, and stay focused there.
I have already said, I focus on the 12 players in our squad, but we know very well who is on the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn was surprised by the way his players had played and said: 'I don't put too much in there.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is about the way each individual player is shaped and there is something different to do there.
It's great to be out there with a party, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full potential as a goalie is tested.
That's the message you have to impose on the players, that is play on top of your ability tomorrow.
Now, you leave your party behind you and those have to play at the top of their ability, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be counting on his players to be able to play better as singles than as teammates, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk has experienced both consequences of a major change on the final day since he was a member of the winning team at Brookline and then a member of the losing team, when Europe achieved the 'Miracle at Medinah'.
"I remember every word of it", he said in response to a question about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he had scolded his players at the start of last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow but you want to start well as you saw at Brookline and at Medinah.
When this energy is directed to one side, it puts great pressure on the mid-field matches.
We set up our team like that and we put the players out like we wanted, you know, to create some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with showing dominance in the coming game and is opposed by Rory McIlroy in the main match and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I joined this group of guys because I think they will be good for the whole day", Bjorn said of his preferences for the singles matches.
The German warship is again put back.
The newest German Navy frigate, which was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, will not take place until next year, local media reported, due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate,, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but major post-delivery problems have greatly hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
It is suggested that they will have a super-powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technology such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest frigates for two years away from home ports.
But the continuing delay means that the cutting-edge warships - which would enable them to demonstrate power overseas - will be out of date by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate was in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after taking it over.
Little was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but the German media cited several allegations of software and hardware failure if it was not deployed on a combat mission.
The shortages of cargo were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were being operated by a crew of 120 seamen - half the crew on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces the performance of the ships and limits the ability of the Navy to upgrade in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, which weighs 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of the hardware, the cost of the whole project - including the cost of training the staff - is very high.
The cost is said to have risen to €3.1 billion ($3.6) - up from €2.2 billion at the start.
The problems with the newest frigate are very important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German fleet is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Fleet was running out of ships that could evacuate them.
The official said that the issue had increased over the years because old ships had been decommissioned but new ships had not been replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates was able to be part of the Fleet.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of leather wings.
New research is underway on a farm in the Northern Territory to find out how the leatherback uses the countryside to forage for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the unique flight behaviour of mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust of Scotland will continue to study the common leatherback and soprano pipistrelles, as well as the Daubenton leatherback at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at special locations around the estate to follow the activities of the leather races during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) staff shall carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound analysis of each record, performed by experts, will reveal the frequency of the waves that make the broad wings and what each particular species does.
Habitats are mapped and then described to represent a record of their behaviour in a big picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the National Trust for Scotland, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for leatherback whales and the way each species uses them.
This information will help to demonstrate the benefits of normal forest management such as the creation of a mine and how best to preserve forest land for leatherback wings and other related species.
The number of long-eared bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that deprives them of their livelihoods and habitats.
Wind turbines and sprinklers can be as harmful as coated paper and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks by cat fleas.
There are no blind leather wings, really.
However, their nocturnal habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when they are considering matters of importance.
They find worms and bugs in their flight paths from a flying saucer, a sophisticated technique.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very much in the know.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, survey forests and, occasionally, rescue.
The organisation has established a special sanctuary for leather-wingers, the first and only one in Scotland, at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of leather-wing.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the best choice for them.
"We have a great area for leather wings here at Threave", he said.
We have the old buildings, a lot of old houses and good housing.
But there is still much we don't know about leather wings, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to be successful.
It emphasises the importance of checking leather fleeces before building and housing are maintained, as if one maternity fleece were destroyed, it could kill up to 400 female fleeces, young fleeces and possibly all the fleeces in that area.
Leather wings are protected and it is against the law to kill, disturb, destroy their eggs or their feathers.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an Albanian official of the Leatherback Preservation Trust, urges the community to help.
She said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our leather wings and, for many of the species we have, we don't know how their entire populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies the allegation against him as lawyers are about to put the law to German press.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied that he was baptised as a Christian, saying that people want to give themselves publicity by using his name.
Her lawyers are about to take legal action against the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have then given her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on an Instagram live video with his followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and called them "disgusting".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It is not the same.
What we're going to talk about today is a lie, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner speaking into the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is natural.
They want to be famous, when they call my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine", the player said, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take legal action against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they say are unacceptable in the area of privacy.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player would seek compensation for damages, at a level commensurate with the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room as he made a toned demand for her, allegedly, according to papers filed by the Duke of County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was 99 percent fine but the other one percent let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that the two had sex but that it was homosexual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at a hospital but agreed to an out of court settlement because she was 'scared of being acquitted' and 'feared she would be publicly humiliated'.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the appointment because she is very upset about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged incident occurred, and this summer, he moved to a huge club, Juve, in a €100 million deal.
The UK would be forever in the dark if it lost its carmakers.
The UK would be forever a failure if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business.
He said it was a matter of concern that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC without a solution, it would stop car production at its factories at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that jobs could be lost if there were delays at the border, in the event of no Brexit deal.
The Burnaston factories - which make the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced a whopping 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'I think if Britain leaves the European Union unsettled at the end of March, car production at this plant will stop again,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU with no solution on how cross-border trade will operate; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks associated with supply chains in the event of the failure of the Directive.
The Toyota production line operates on a direct, on-time basis.Parts arrive from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for a custom-made car.
If the UK leaves without a solution on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and a shortage of parts, the industry says.
It would not be feasible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus, production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan is precisely designed to avoid such delays at the border.
"We need to have a solution, we want to have the best solution, not just to continue the success we have now, but to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC.
The evidence we have from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with supply chains, which are very profitable at the moment.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it said that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of factories and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a technician for the Unite workshop in the factory, said that his anxiety was increasing.
A government spokesman said: 'We have a plan, which is accurate and reliable, for the future relationship with the EU.'
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, the White House says.
A key meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general could be postponed for another week as the fight continues under Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump's allies and the possibility that the president may have obstructed justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the vice-chief prosecutor's rule and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence is the backdrop to be heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president being removed from office via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein crossed the report.
But he went to the White House this Monday and the word out that he was about to resign.
It was also announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would prefer not to impeach Rosenstein but then postponed the meeting to avoid upsetting the Senate committee hearing on the judges in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed another Senate plenary hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was featured on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week but I could imagine it being postponed another week on top of all the things going on in the supreme court.
We shall see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters disagree with that statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing since September 10.
The programme's host, Chris Wallace, asked her why this was the case.
Sanders said that the briefings were not lacking because he did not like TV commentators making jokes, although she said: "I don't like that they make jokes".
She then hinted that Trump and the press would have more direct contacts.
The President has had more Q&A sessions than any previous President,she said but did not give any evidence of this. We looked at these figures.
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but if members of the press have a chance to ask the US president questions directly, it will be a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do that often the last few weeks and that will be put in a press briefing when you're able to speak to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions as he leaves the White House or takes part in open sessions or press conferences alongside distinguished visitors.
There are rarely single presbyteries.
The president may have shown why in New York this week when he met with a cast of reporters in a sometimes bizarrely uninhibited manner.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers at NHS Scotland to thank them for their country and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The EU's foreign policy is based on the principle of the free movement of people, and the EU's foreign policy is based on the principle of the free movement of people.
The Albanian Government has already committed to pay for the cost of applications for settler status by EU citizens working in public sector services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: "Negotiations have been ongoing between the UK and the EU on the UK's passage, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
I know that this story is very painful for all of you.
That is why I would like to express my appreciation for the work of all staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Albania is your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Operation Desert Storm made by Christion Abercrombie when he was shot in the head
Mike Organ of the Tennesseans reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had a crisis operation when he injured his head in a 31-27 victory over the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He came to the sideline and fell off a pole", said Reed.
Trainers and medics delivered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before he was straightened and taken back for further examination.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, reported that Abercrombie had been taken from the laboratory at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said that there is no information available on the nature/size of the injury yet and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sophomore and this is his first season playing for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game which brings his total to 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the Builders' plans
The plan will benefit from Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to him
Stamp duty will be charged on those not paying UK tax
The Treasury estimates that £120 million a year will be raised to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that a higher rate of stamp duty will be charged on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan is seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the extra money will be used to boost the Government's efforts to deal with people living abroad.
The surcharge - which is due to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on rental houses and apartments - could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury estimates it could raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built homes in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it more difficult for people to buy their first home.
Many of the country's shopping areas - especially in the capital - are very crowded due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty to help more young people get their first place of residence.
He criticised large construction companies for keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to end quotas on affordable housing to help Britain's housing sector.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of far-reaching housing proposals including rent control and the elimination of the exclusion of people without a fault.
He wants to give councils more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: 'I said last year that my aim in my prime ministership would be to revitalise Britain's vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life for themselves here.
Non-UK residents and overseas-based companies should not have the same access to buying houses as hard-working UK residents.
For many, many people, the dream of owning their own dwellings is a long-term one and the way many people go to sleep outdoors is a nightmare.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be a manager in Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his last ambition is to manage Scotland one day.
Jack is a 42-year-old Albanian who is looking to revive the club from the North East, who are third in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He joined the City of Light in the summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Albany Premiership last season.
When I was a player I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Albanian Sportsbound.
But when I was growing up my father and I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden and it's always attracted me back.
I will not have that opportunity unless I am successful as a club manager.
The Sunderland team was previously managed by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross previously managed Alloa Athletic and said he had no qualms about meeting such big men at a big club and had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The current success rate of this club is the one that has put me back in the Premier League.
The club's structure and facilities make it a Premier League club with no doubt.
It's not an easy task but I wouldn't call it success if I didn't get it back then.
Ross has only three years as a manager, having spent time as assistant manager with Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Harts.
He helped Alloa come off the back of relegation to the third tier and made such a transformation for St Mirren who were in danger of being relegated that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The tribes were probably talking about taking Alloa's leadership.
I really thought that a job as a manager was right for me rather than a job as a player.
This may seem strange to say, but I did quite well, had a reasonable entry and enjoyed some reasonably high peak points.
But the life of an actor can be difficult at times.
There are many, many things you have to do week after week.
I suffer from the stress and pressure of work, but I feel that the life of the manager is the life for me.
I always wanted to be my manager and since I have that job now my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I came of age.

The summer heat wave is adding to the influx of struggling British pubs but putting extra pressure on supply chains.
The figures showed a 2.7 per cent increase in the number of people entering public houses but a 4.8 per cent decline in the number of people entering private houses.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The result of England's July participation in the World Cup lasting longer than expected was that the July pattern was continued with a 2.8 per cent higher average household income but the projections hit even harder.
Trade in the provinces fell by 1.8% in May and was even worse in July.
Taverns and bars focusing on drinking classes fared better and pro-am with pro-am fared worse.
The sun's heat affected dining tables that focused on food but had less of a dramatic impact on them than it did on those that were not.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
Sales of operating taverns and bars increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and food sales decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman from RSM's lifestyle and leisure analysts said: "These results have confirmed the trends we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the main factors affecting sales in the outdoor market.
Unsurprisingly, provincial groups are always struggling, and will find it very difficult to accept a 4.8 per cent year-on-year decline alongside the ongoing cost burdens they face.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperature we had in August will bring relief to those who need it.
Overall growth in July was 2.7 per cent for taverns and divisions, including new openings, reflecting the slowdown in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pub, bar and wine sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and serves as the industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account and is obsessed with their parents.
A survey showed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts and keep them hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils showed a rise in fake Instagram pages
This has increased the public's concern about the posting of sexual content
Twenty percent of students reported having a primary account they show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages - a reference to the photo-sharing site instagram.
This has increased the concern of people that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a clean 'main account' to show to their parents and that they also have a private account.
A mother accidentally came across a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter was teasing other teenagers.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Principals' Conference (ISC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and eight of them admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of the HMC Mike Buchanann said: "It is worrying how so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces in places that are inaccessible to parents and teachers".
Eilidh Doyle will act as the Athletes' Voice on the Athletics Board of Albania
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Athletics Albanians board at the annual meeting of the board of control.
Doyle is Albania's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in high regard by the sports fans of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that her presence on the board will go a long way to smoothing the athletics course in Scotland", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am very keen to act as the voice of athletics and I hope that I can make my own contribution to the sport's leadership in Scotland.'
An American was left unable to walk after suffering a temporary bout of blood restriction despite winning the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and having a total of four Olympic gold medals.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today is my birthday.
I was not able to walk
The doctors said we should wait and see if I get better and if I do, how much better.
It was a very hard job but I made a full recovery, I have learnt how to walk again and I'm doing a kidnapping drill today!

Contrary opinions are online about a notice comparing breastfeeding mothers to mothers.
A company offering a breast pump has sparked controversy online by advertising a woman giving birth to a baby as if she were in labor.
On the occasion of the launch of the world's first portable breast pump, the technology company Elvie launched a semi-realistic, music-inspired announcement to demonstrate the freedom the pump brings to mothers who are seeking milk.
Four mothers danced in a soap full of fire, singing songs like: "Here I am, I'm making myself but you don't see any tail" and "For you didn't notice these are only my tears".
The curse continues: 'Being pumped out, being pumped out, I am feeding these children.
The advert was posted on the company's Facebook page and sparked online controversy.
It was viewed by 77,000 people and was referenced by hundreds, with many saying it ignored the horrors of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product", wrote one person.
They are similar to us in that they need a tiger to collect milk, but in their case their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth.

Another wrote: "It's obviously a painful thing for the mother and the child.
Yes, but why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can hold their babies?
Another wrote: "So it is with your prophet. He was cut off from the world".
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she thought the song was very funny.
I think it's a great plan.
I would have one if I were still drinking milk.
I cried just like a cow when the pumping was going on.
The announcement is a little mad but I took it at its own merit.
A noble person invented this product, " wrote another.
Another had this comment: This is a comic ad targeted at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like they are being "babbled".
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women reveal that they were dancing and the pumps discreetly grow into their final beats.
The campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump their breasts consider themselves to be barren.
Elvie's Pump is completely silent, there are no wires or pipes attached, it sits discreetly within a feeding trough so that women can move around, hold their babies in their hands and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a participant in the discussion of early childhood development at Mother, had this to say: Elvie's Kitchen is so revolutionary that it deserves a launch, inspiring.
By showing the relationship between pregnant women and lactating dairy cows we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all the challenges it entails, and to showcase the incredible freedom of the new crop and make it into a fun animal that people could talk about.
This was not the first time that Elvie's pipe was in the news.
A mother-of-two walked down a mini-skate during London Fashion Week using the product, illustrating the work of designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Quietly Run to Camp Puball on the Texas Border
There has been a large increase in the number of migrant children being detained, although there has been little change in the number of people crossing the border, as child detention has become more difficult due to Trump's tough policies and tough talk.
What has happened in the past is that migrants were sponsored by undocumented migrants, but now they fear that by applying to sponsor a child, they will jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
This risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that would-be sponsors and adults with a family would have to provide their birth details and share them with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress this week that the agency had arrested scores of people who had been accused of sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of people who are sponsors, or members of sponsoring households, in this country are illegally, with criminal aliens being a large share of the victims.
We are therefore always looking for these people", said Mr Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, the officers introduced new rules requiring them to appear in court within a month of the time of their arrest, rather than after the previously standard 60 days for convicted sex offenders.
Many will present themselves by videoconference rather than in person, to demand an immigration judge to grant them legal status.
Those persons deemed ineligible for relief shall be expelled from the country expeditiously.
According to prison workers and reports from the system in recent months, children are more likely to experience anxiety or depression and to have violent incidents or attempted escapes while in detention.
Supporters said that such concerns are added in larger facilities like Tornillo that are so large that a child will not be seen struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a public school without enough time to prepare them emotionally, or to say goodbye to their friends, it could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish forces to immediately evacuate the country
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that this is the eighth year of war in that country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, declared that foreign forces in Syria are illegal and are allegedly fighting terrorism, and will be treated accordingly.
'They must leave immediately without any conditions,' he told the assembly.
The war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes, Moualem declared.
He said Damascus would continue to fight until the end of the blessed war until we have eliminated terrorist groups and any illegal foreign forces from all parts of Syria.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria providing training and advice mostly to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in that war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed some western countries for spreading unjustified concerns that encourage refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return", he said.
They are making a political issue a problem that should be treated as a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement by Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey ensured that Russian-backed Syrian forces would not launch a large-scale invasion of the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed the "clear timing" of the agreement and said he expected the war to target and destroy jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front with links to Al-Qaeda.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee soon with government and opposition representatives to draft a constitution for Syria for the time the war is over and in preparation for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to a review of the current constitutional provisions, and encouraged the involvement of non-state actors.
When Trump Speaks Second Term
According to this perception, Mr Trump should win the 2020 election unless, as many liberals expect, a bribery or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
The clock was never a drama of the presidency then it would be without a doubt!
There are no signs that the audience is getting tired of God.
Prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million since 2014 for CNN and MSNBC's ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to the 1.7 million it had four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable rates and was watched by up to 3.5 million people on prime-time nights.
'This is a fire that is attracting people to us because it's something we don't understand,' said Neal Baer, who was showing ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a presidential secretary who was made secretary of state when Washington DC was attacked and destroyed.
Comedy writer Nell Schovell wrote "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", and has other theories.
She recalls taking a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? for sis.
'Cause it makes me laugh, ' he said, 'that's what Mr Scovell told me.
The north is fun.
Of course, life is not like a TV show and the stories from Washington could have an impact on what happens next in Roe v. Wade, whether migrant families can be reunited, and the health of the world economy.
It is only the most passionate people who turn off the television.
However, it's more than being a sober citizen when you watch a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used "deep background" as a source for his book "Fear", or a pilot's cock with its oyster-like tentacles that Paul Maher bought for $15,000 (which the Washington Post said was a "majority of a cow") or the implications of Stormy Daniels's description of Mr. Trump's life.
For me, anyway, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The result of some of the things he's doing is that it's like one of those reality shows and it gives you something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment's "Pawn Stars" creator, about Trump's show's changing cast and the complexities it puts in the plot (suggesting a fight with N.F.L. or Kim Jong-un).
You have to watch every single episode or you'll lose the plot.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was shining and it was 80 degrees outside his residence on the shore of Kaua'i, but inside there were people watching MSNBC and CNN recording.
He could not separate himself from television since Brett Kavanaugh was in limbo before a Senate Judiciary Committee and a Supreme Court ruling between the two.
I remember back then when we were doing all these stupid things and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke but as it happened they were right.

A silver lining is coming in in the hottest midterm elections ever to the House of Representatives.
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is being flooded with money since the convention district was redesigned so that two elected officials are vying for the same seat.
A new boundary for the Pittsburgh suburb has been drawn so that Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election this spring - has been cast.
against current Republican Congressman Keith Rothfus who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's 12th district which largely surrounds the 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the census areas were unconstitutionally set out in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district started a round of trumpet blasts between the parties' main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name has been in the public's mouth in Pennsylvania after he won a highly-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
Republicans held the seat for more than a decade and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are slightly ahead.
SAM was considering a penalty for supporting China against El Salvador but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing and Washington did little about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in July 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his colleagues ordered the Trump Organization's management to leave.
Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to recall American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.
But no penalty was considered for any of them except for the Salvadoran who received $140 million in aid in 2017 from America, including drug control assistance as well as development and economic support.
Among the proposed penalties were cuts in financial aid, targeted restrictions on visas that would hit hard at this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America called for a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that would follow on from a similar meeting held last year and be seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior administration officials had indicated before mid-September that they wanted the conference to go ahead, ending any plans to impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is due to speak at the conference in mid-November and diplomats say it shows that the administration considers the meeting very important.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard-hitting messages of sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Sir Bolton declined to discuss the details of the confrontation but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition that their names not be mentioned.
An external analyst supported the accounts provided by them but spoke on condition that his name not be mentioned.
The study of history
The next blow may be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on how Mr Trump may have obstructed justice and there is much evidence of that on the public record.
There are reports that Mr. Mueller is also looking into whether Mr. Trump was working in collusion with Russia in their attack on our election.
If another party wins control of the US Congress, Mr Trump may have to account for his actions in front of those very same people when he goes before the voters and perhaps a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty involved in this story and I don't want to suggest that it is inevitable that Mr Trump will be put in the same position as anyone else in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the divide will continue.
German army officers were prepared to overthrow Hitler in 1938 for his Western opposition and his support of the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the stagnation of civilization is slowed or accelerated.
America has to deal with a lot of those points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the investigation of Mr. Mueller, a stick and a stick?
Rosenstein was in trouble since this newspaper had reported last year that he was recording the presidency under duress and expressed opinions that he was unfit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times account is inaccurate.
What if the FBI's recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is found to be incomplete and unfair - or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite credible allegations that he sexually assaulted and gave false testimony.
And above all else, will we vote in the midterm elections for the United States Congress that will determine whether Mr. Trump has to answer for what he has done?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be in for a long and difficult winter.
I believe that we will not fail to learn the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had seized her during a diplomatic mission.
She was saved, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to the council of the Saboids to burn on that board on which the svastika was.
Since this is my legacy, how can I be hopeless about what lies ahead?

Graham Dorrans optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be the hosts when they play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, having done well to finish as runners-up against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they win at Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans suffered a knee injury and was unable to make his debut this season until the game against Villarreal which ended 2-2. However, he believes Rangers will be able to take advantage of that result to achieve better things.
"We would like that because Villarreal are a good team", said Graham, 31.
We went into the game expecting to get an advantage and we got a point.
We might win in the end but, on the whole, a good result is to finish on a draw.
They were probably more manly in the first half but we improved in the second half and were better than them.
As for Thursday, it will be a big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I am sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
We certainly had a tough year last year, with the injuries I suffered and the changes that have happened in the club itself but we think that everything is good now.
The squad is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is good.
I hope that we can now push forward, this season to give us confidence and confidence.
Women lose sleep at night worrying about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
Around half of those who took part in a Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them but they are not doing anything to talk to them about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance.
This is the place to start.
You cannot prepare your children to provide care unless you tell them well in advance what you want.
Work with your counsellor and your children to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as this can have a significant impact on the cost.
Ask your financial adviser for advice: The adviser may suggest ways to pay for these costs.
The following may be considered as options for long-term care - traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash value hybrid policies to help you pay for these costs, or self-insurance from your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Declare your legal documents: Avoid legal situations before they start.
Appoint a healthcare provider to act on your behalf so that you can be a person you trust to look after your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your requirements in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider giving a power of attorney to someone regarding your money affairs.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are left disabled.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these details down on a plan so that you are prepared.
'It's not just about money, but who are the doctors?' said Martin.
What are the drug ages?
Who will take care of the goat?
Have that plan ready.
A man is frequently stabbed by a haer-rashifil in Ilfracombe
A man was often struck by an air-rabbit while walking home after a night on the canes.
The victim is in his teens and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the head, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting that occurred around 02:30 GMT as a random act.
The victim did not see the one who attacked him.
He was not seriously injured and the police asked for witnesses to speak to them.
Landforms and summits in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication systems are destroyed and emergency officials are unable to obtain any information from Donggala province, which is located north of Palu and closer to the epicentre of the earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 Palu people were displaced after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a bay on the east coast of Sulawesi island and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a volcano that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of northwestern Sulawesi island.
A vice-state and an administrative region with fewer than five constituent states is estimated to have 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi is largely dependent on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is done in Morowali on the other coast beyond Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by frequent earthquakes and tsunamis over the past 100 years due to the Indonesian disaster mitigation efforts.
In 1938, tsunamis killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The northern suburbs of Donggala were attacked in 1996 and killed nine.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire seismic zone and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major landslides and landslides of recent years are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggering tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast and half of those killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia. It triggered tsunami waves that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and induced six 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed the village shrines and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, damaging and releasing people who remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No earthquakes were caused at the time but over 100 people were killed when buildings collapsed.
2018: Landslides hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's son and daughter-in-law caught on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report issued by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, trespassing for reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took her phone away from her.
According to a report from KTUU, Palin has been transferred to the Mat-Su Emergency Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond.
According to the network, when he appeared before the court on Saturday and was asked what he was arguing he replied 'not guilty, definitely guilty'.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor which means he could face up to a day in jail along with a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was accused in December 2017 of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, breaking and entering a domestic violence crime report, possession of a weapon while under the influence of a substance in connection with the incident.
A girl claimed that he stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for suggesting that her son's violent behavior was caused by post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds have died in landslides and earthquakes in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered tremors that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications systems are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a short distance from central Sulawesi, which is located on the northeastern side of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are being shared on social media showing the moment the earth began to shake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Paul when the smoke billowed into them.
The death penalty is being demanded by Federal prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight, a rare punishment that no one in the state has received for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is alleged to have used rented trucks from Home Depot to attack a bicycle range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and to have previously attacked pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the victim's brother in any way and inflicted serious bodily harm, as the notice of the death penalty intent sought, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges including eight counts of murder for the benefit of conspiracy, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said that the attack required "extensive planning and premeditation" and said that Saipov carried it out in a "gross, cruel and brutal" manner.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", which is specified in the confidential notice.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been almost a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of apathy in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the detour.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were all disappointed with the prosecutors' decision.
"We are forced to seek the death sentence rather than accept a guilty plea for a life sentence with no possibility of allowing the trauma of these events to be prolonged for all those involved", said Patton.
Saipov's defense team asked previous prosecutors not to seek the death penalty
MEPs call for the EU to be a "melting pot" of the EU's citizens and the EU's institutions
Nigel Farage promised to send the people on a march today as he protested at the Tories' conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians needed to be pressured by European interests - and one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should take the lead in the EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would be lost if Mr Farage were British Secretary of State.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is highlighted as she wants to bring together a divided and divided party and Remain Together after taking part in a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep his Chequers settlement plan on track as Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU are under attack.
Her supporters asserted that she would continue to seek to enter into a market with Brussels despite the backlash - and that she would force the Egyptians to choose between her own package and a battering ram.
Bone at the crowd means Go Go Go in Solihull that he was trying to throw out Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage be made a peer and put him in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have left by now, he said.
Member Wellingborough also said: 'I will stand for the British but we need to throw out the Chequers.'
Explaining the reasons why he is against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be a dictator.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The MEPs rejected suggestions that the 2016 vote had changed public opinion: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is a lie".
Tory Voter Rights supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general is not happy with the Chequers, the opposition is not happy to vote for them, our party members and our activists who walk the streets and get votes for us in the first place are not happy with them.
I ask you to throw out your Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: "Prime Ministers keep their posts when they put their word".
Mr Farage said at the rally that pressure was needed on politicians if they were to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"What is at stake now is the trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They want to abandon the Constitution and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he also said: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to abandon Brexit.
"We are going to mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-Remain supporters marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists were raising anti-British sentiment after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis was mocking the Conservatives for the security difficulties they had with a party platform as the conference was beginning.
"These are the people who tell us that they can apply the IT systems and all the technology for Canada and beyond, for a border without barriers, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
A similar situation exists in the United Kingdom.
There is no such thing as good luck, he said.
Warren intends to look closely at the stand in the presidential election
S.A.M. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he is to take a hard look at standing in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has often criticized President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Many said she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting she had with constituents and the town hall meeting format being used since Trump began his term in office.
One of the attendees asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that included a woman at the top.
Man arrested after Sims' dead release from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a rally at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the filming.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson released him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, to having a weapon, and to having released Wayde Sims.
Simpson was apprehended without difficulty and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-inch, Baton Rouge-raised junior player played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton racing towards the world title after the team orders him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on the Saturn it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a big role in the race.
From the outside, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the ground after he had defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the scoring first and allowed Hamilton to hit the traffic at the back of the pack, something that would have a big impact on the course.
The Mercedes went to the one lap slock stop afterwards and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action after the Ferrari driver forcibly left the interior free and the risk of him standing the fence after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the heels and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, keeping a tight grip on his base to focus on a fast finish and passing Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the slopes on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the next eight laps with Raikkonen taking fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri has worked so hard all weekend and he was a gentleman in that he let me over.
The staff have done a great job, one by one", said Hamilton.
Horrible Body Signaling That Was Then
President Donald Trump was mocking Senator Dianne Feinstein's firing on Saturday after she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford alleging sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at his inauguration in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mischievous and ridiculous and false".
"The only thing that can overcome the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate these past few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and miserable and angry and ridiculous", he said.
When you look at the stories of release and release and when they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, where are you?
Remember his answer... you spilled his papers - oh, oh, what?
Oh, not a scratch.
I didn't scratch.
Well, wait a minute.
We have not escaped...No, we have not escaped", he said, also while addressing the senator.
A letter detailing Kavanaugh's allegations was sent to Feinstein by Ford in July, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't deny Dr Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported in The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked.
But the president seemed to have no objection to his denial, saying during Saturday night's shoot: I'll tell you the truth, there was a horrible body signal.
She may not have done it but that's the worst body sign I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on his behalf.
They are determined to take back power, however they choose to do so.
You see the courage, the grace, they care who they hurt, who they have to bend to in order to gain power and control", the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
The series was won by Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
The Scots took action in the defeat in the Scottish Cup on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 home draw in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had the lead at two backs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a tie before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before his victory was followed by two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
The third goal of the season in the Scottish Cup was for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, and the Giants' victory in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the quarter at 3:35 and was assisted by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the team a second back four minutes later.
During a very busy early period, Sullivan took the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants had the lead before the first shot before scoring the second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side put themselves in a position of power and once again Bouchard scored with a massive back-off at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee into the lead for the first time in the game last second period and made sure they had the win with his team's fifth half-back through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their first game of the season on Friday.
Air traffic controller gets killed to ensure hundreds of people on a plane can escape from the ground
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after his death in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely got off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
The area is still hit by strong thunderstorms and many people are stranded in the slum in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled with their souls, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly turbulent control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off a control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him in the morning before the helicopter arrived.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that thousands may have died and the country's disaster mitigation agency says a border has been set in place to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead is still expected to rise as there were still many bodies under the rubble as not enough could be salvaged", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave that reaches six metres has destroyed the city and a mass extinction will take place on Sunday.
Aircraft and business aircraft are carrying in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, the mother of a 35-year-old, told Sky News: "Every minute a body is being invaded by a swarm of bees.
There is a shortage of fresh water.
Small markets are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Association in Indonesia told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but they don't know what they will find there.
Tragedy is already here, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the nation: 'I want you all to work day and night to do all the work related to the relocation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by landslides in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after plane crash in Murlach
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific island in the Pacific Ocean says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew members safely ejected from the downed plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that it was so rare to find male passengers on the Satharn.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not directly respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what was responsible for the landslide and what exactly fell out.
Both the airline and Cabal S.A.M. said the plane landed in the mud just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone over the side of the road.
American pioneer Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very slowly.
"That's a great thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to swim through water to the hidden routes of the sunken plane.
He said that the plane's servers were locked and that they were beating and that he suffered a minor head injury.
Cabhlach S.A.M. said that sailors working side by side with her helped to improve the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years but none of them involved Air Niugini.
An analyst calculates the timeline of the night as a living female fire.
Prosecutors had made their case on Saturday in the trial of men accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The H.A.M. Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the Department of Law and Justice, testified for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He gave the jury an account of how he had used mobile phone records to piece together a story about the movements of the 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which went against what he had previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the details showed that his phone had been handled by Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on the stand on Saturday and gave evidence that he was not at home that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was telling a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about a year before she died.
The cell phone records suggested they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
"He wrote her out of his life", said Hale.
It is laid down that the defendant will give his closing arguments on Thursday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop triad is trying to challenge the negative attitudes towards the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins as political messages and address social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and have a sense of purpose again.
The Fugees and Common have been re-emerged in the UK through a number of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blue guy?!
Child custody in NY law puts couples on the street after being given a stick and a dick because of text message
A New York child is forced to legally divorce her discriminatory husband after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she is a different kind of person.
The couple say they are racist, and compare the legal case to a scam.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby sitter, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"I'm glad I'm not married", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Ms Maurice.
After realizing she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman gave her an uncomfortable, stick and cane to Ms. Maurice, saying that her babysitter had been drugged and was an African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for the day's work and then sent home for an Uber.
Now Maurice is legally forcing the couple to fire her, and she is seeking compensation equivalent to $350 a day for the six-month residential post she was employed for, though she was not given a contract.
"I'm trying to show them, look, you shouldn't do things like that", she told the Post on Thursday, also saying "I know there is discrimination".
The couple have responded to the statement that they are racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do, and feared that they could not trust her after being introduced to her.
My wife said something to me that she didn't mean to say.
It is not racist.
We are not racists,' husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the care of someone you were ill-disposed toward, even if you did so by mistake?
Your newborn child?
Listen now!
Plasco compared the legal situation to a "race" saying that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was pregnant.
What are you going to go chasing a guy like that?
That's not a nice thing to do,' said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public has not hesitated to criticize the couple on social media, lashing out at them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not understand a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine that you were a person who was reading it for the first time before it was published".
It's funny now that we know that Paddington has succeeded.
While saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small title to write a book for children, would be pleased to have his work rejected, she also said that she was saddened and saddened by the book's 60th anniversary celebration after he died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important family member", she said her father was proud of his success in the end without being mathematical about it.
"He was a quiet man, and he was boasting about himself", she said.
But since Paddington was such a realist to him, it was almost like having a kid who does well: you're proud of this even though you didn't make the catch.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he created and dreamed it himself, it has always been attributed to Paddington himself.
A girl was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After the birth her daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
"Nad was calling me regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to come home", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said hello to her.
I said, "Tashi, I delight you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were going out early and out of her system.
She had died some time before and now everything was shutting down.
I had just been sitting there, and I knew this was going to fall out.
I could not be a mute, a squealer, or a weepy one because I was surrounded by children and adults.
I had to keep my composure.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, devastated by the death of her daughter, joined the other passengers on the plane - not knowing how much she had to cry.
"We don't know", she said.
I had a black head and the deer were always crying.
It's hard to explain it but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
That my love and understanding were from him.
I knew how much he loved her.
Wise women put up cards to prevent suicide on the road
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to keep others from putting their own lives in danger.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up face cards in Britain with encouraging messages and numbers people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he had a breakdown and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and that his ambition was to influence others.
Everyone knew him because of his intelligence.
They always ended up burning any room to meditate.
However, he resigned before his death, as it was a very dangerous place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, became his brother's next victim after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: 'I am always worried that this will affect him.'
Ms Davis created the cards, so that people know that there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in your cell--if you need to be talking.
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies' for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, soon after her mother's death.
He didn't say he was low or depressed or anything", she said.
A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
It was the Christmas Eve - when the children opened their presents he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that she was very sad to die, but they have to face him: He is tearing the children apart.
He snatches us from each other.
But we all have to keep going and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy and the FBI has begun an investigation.
'I thought that if we could really get something like what he wanted - a limited in time investigation, in scope - we might have an agreement,' said Mr Flake on Saturday, also saying that he was afraid that the committee would fall apart with a solid joint line.
Why didn't Chief Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It is because of time pressures that they are under pressure.
There are only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans do as badly as they expect, they will be much weaker in their bid to get their man elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then met his wife, Ashley, who is the personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI has made its report?
A vote is required in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Kim's regime is causing a decline in the number of people who back away from North Korea.
The number of people who have been turned away by North Korea to go to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said 1,127 people defected to North Korea last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
South Korean citizenship is eventually offered to most people who turn their backs on North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the closest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers North Korean defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their home country.
Relations between North and South Korea - still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the lack of progress in nuclear disarmament talks.
This followed historic meetings in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general manner to work towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-weapon-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for failing to move forward.
"If the US is not trusted, there will be no threat to our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way we will disarm ourselves on our own turf first", the EU's Secretary-General said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "unfit" and "unfit to serve on the Supreme Court"
Minority Leader of the House Nancy Pelosi said the nomination to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was atomic and that he was mentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comic an interview on Saturday at the Festival of the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think if it was a woman who did that, they would be stupid", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two teenagers.
During his opening statements, Kavanaugh was very blunt, almost choking and sometimes running away from the conversation while talking about his children and his time in high school.
He openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, citing alleged corruption and organized corruption as the culprits and was angered by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, she did not agree.
"I will say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only fit to be on the Supreme Court but fit to be on the court that he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about possible censures by Kavanaugh against the Taxpayer Protection Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a timid, timid person to go to court and expect us to do something so great", Pelosi said.
And it's not big for women to do it.
It is a corrective force, releasing months and years of anger, and it cannot let it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's a strange thing, do you? I don't know what it is.
She continued, 'A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, saying that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you're sorry because I'm crying.'
I'm mad at you.
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was great.
Anger is allowed as a way to release anger because it is basically not understood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself in a state of anger I could not express, was of an older woman grabbing my back - a shrewd manager who had always feared me - and dragging me down a flight of stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
You don't know that you're gay.
They will think you are sad and they will be happy because they have hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart when he ran for the presidency.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was engaged in an extramarital affair entitled Monkey Business and he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, much to her frustration, decided that she should consider running for the presidency herself.
'It was not a stupid decision,' she told me, laughing 30 years later.
Seven other candidates were already in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As he was last in the campaign, she was behind in raising money and so she promised not to enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was free labor.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only receive $250 of their money.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so upset - with gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system for being so difficult to raise money and targeting voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she became upset.
"I thought I was a neurological patient", recalled Ms Schroeder of the media response to her.
You would think Kleenex was a corporate jerk to me.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
Who is she?
Why the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The US-China trade war could be in the open, and while the war is far from over, Beijing could benefit in the long run from the countries' submission, experts say.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year when he cut a tax on China's core exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant crisis occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which meant that almost half of all goods entering the US from China have been taxed.
Beijing applies sales out the same way every time, and the last act was to impose tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the US in a blow-by-blow fashion, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon.
If Washington were to stand back it would mean that it would be necessary to comply with their demands, but the embarrassment would be too great if Xi Jinping, the president of China, publicly swore allegiance to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure from the US trade war could positively support China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would initiate a collapse of the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than previously admitted by observers", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, at a reflection seminar.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country after it has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, things on the ground are much more stable and resilient thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is still renovating the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring things back to normal.
All the conditions are now in place for a voluntary return to the country that had to leave because of the terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But it made it clear that it would not accept aid or conditions from countries that supported the withdrawal.
Europe is about Corn Ryder in Paris.
Team Europe has captured the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
Now USA have lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the crew of Captain Thomas Bjorn's Homicide reached the 14.5 points needed to get the best of the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, threw his toss into the water at the par 3 16th hole, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer made the cut in every round, and is one of four players to have gone 5-0-0 ever since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the low-scoring player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a former eight-time Ryder Cup champion, was the tournament's leading European with 25.5 career points.
I don't normally cry, but I don't have the strength to today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and trusts me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have the horn back.
The team is the most important thing and I am glad I was able to help them,' said Garcia, after the European win.
John Ram, who won the famous US golfer Tiger Woods in singles on Sunday, will now be replaced by John Ram from the same country.
'I'm very proud of winning against Tiger Woods, I was watching that guy as I was growing up,' said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, with 14 major championships, and Jack Nicklaus just ahead.
The USA team struggled to find the wings throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played an excellent golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's play was in a state of confusion, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
Some time in the morning we thought we had hit Europe.
We fought.
Thomas is going to recommend.
He's a great captain.
We played 12 players very well.
We'll get our heads together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I'm proud of these 12 men and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to make a congratulations.
The other team played better than us.
