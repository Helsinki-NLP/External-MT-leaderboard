A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he does not know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, noting that his affairs were finally going well.
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall shopping center Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco native, Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was a homicide and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a waitress in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a waitress chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked and shocked by her death.
"We have a small team that acts as a close family and will be greatly missed", the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had initially stayed at the hostels, but that recently his affairs were finally going well.
He found an apartment and dated a girl, Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a benevolent man with a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook us dinner, to make dinner, said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of quarrel.
He was a brother who floated with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, she was a great diamond that shone brighter every day", he said.
Anyone with any information on this matter is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Strike of practitioners: Requirements for new workfighting measures
The representatives of practitioners have asked their trade union to approve new labour-fighting measures in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the entire Council to support new workfighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
In July, practitioners and medical students voted to reject the agreement with the BMA.
58% of the members voted against it.
In a letter to members of the JDC on Thursday evening via Twitter, Ellen McCourt said the government had kept a low profile on the issues that led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: 'In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the entirely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns.
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorise the gradual and expanding programme of workfighting, which will begin in early September.
The dispute has resulted in six strikes by practitioners this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA's medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms of the BMA's recommendations.
He had told the BMA members at meetings before the 54,000 medical practitioners and students voted that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be prescribed for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of foreigners?
An experience that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle against words and economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that this reconciliation was more desired in Ankara.
Yes, we were holding hands.
But Putin's smile looked human, and he barely threatened the heat, even according to his own controlled norms.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his dear friend Putin five times, according to one report.
I'm so crazy about the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his statement was the opposite.
But the radiant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara accusing it of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The injury was even worse when it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, state-run media led to a shocking, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations by high officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade from ISIS-held areas in Syria.
He's been very strongly against this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received his requested apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of a strictly bargaining agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can make after he was almost ousted in a failed coup last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
And there's also an economic motive.
The economic sanctions imposed by Russia have been severe, in particular the ban on order flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
As regards Russia, local airlines and airlines will certainly be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed back.
"You toured there, tomatoes came back here", as the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit was also of political value to Moscow.
We are bitterly angry with the West over what is seen as a weak response to an attempted coup.
In addition to the long-running anger over the rapid progress of EU membership negotiations, Putin is emerging, eager to use his coolness and to break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader certainly got a kick out of Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary campaign to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a relief for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a power change.
So this meeting at the Prameya Beach Palace enabled the Russian-Turkish-led "out-of-country alliance" to be presented, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, combining their power.
However, the two have considerable differences, despite public conciliation.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can find common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a catastrophic disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least back in the conversation.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
After the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has given up on these goals.
The Bank's strategists have used the RBS trademark to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been seen as the right thing to let the more national brands come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is working with Scottish customers, but it's not going to start over.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except head office and listings, are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are gaining more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holts Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of clients and staff at Inverness Shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investment brand and employer of our employees because we are now becoming a much more branded bank".
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sporting sponsorship.
It is time to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we have asked) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers, the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you're going to see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins.
Dettori shoots champagne after a double win, with a total of 3,000 wins.
The Frenchman Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone of the evening with his second win on his home circuit in a race run by John Gosden in the Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in a racing career.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Three-time hockey champion Dettori, who won at Ghayyar earlier, said: "This is special.
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that this happened at Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
This isn't a big event, this isn't Royal Ascot, this is a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori is getting a little cheerful when he shows up with Predilection after the win.
Two cyclists have reached this milestone in the road race - champion hockey player Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record-breaking career of more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, nine-time Derby winner with 4,493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of our time, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactful intelligence sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
She's a great ambassador for competitions, and her enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans of the breed for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a weekend and big-game jockey!
Frankly speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the last 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for British competition, but besides, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the landmark landing on a plane from a saloon.
From flight terminations to flight landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain bike.
He won several major races, including his famous Magnificent Seven at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a drug overdose.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after six months of a competition ban, but he showed considerable temperament in challenging the suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, as Dettori has said before that he would like to continue competing until he's at least 50.
Russian President Putin fired the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed the head of the Russian delegation, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said that Putin had ordered Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration, but there was no reason for this.
Since 2012, Ivanov's deputy director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, he graduated with honors from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are your smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As head of the executive branch, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting on state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the head of the Central Command had withdrawn from his request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just a poster child for some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with great skepticism.
In comments to Putin on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it was true that in early 2012, I asked you in the debate to give me four years to take on this very complex, if you could even say work, task.
Well, I've been the head of the department for four years and eight months now.
Ivanov approved the assignment in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the state security service FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once, it was thought that Ivanov could become President Putin of Russia after a second term, since Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
But this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired for shooting a producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a filming location in Los Angeles.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels at the scene.
I regret that it happened, he said in his statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI team's narrative will be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I've given it everything I've got for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I wish I could be there until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans the show can have.
The start of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
Mystery spiders ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man from Banff has asked for help identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes 75 fish could be the windfish left behind by the water wheel.
Bain, who lives 500 feet [500 m] above sea level, published a film on the discovery in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry crossing to the northern terminus and the mainland, which means the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four bridges between the two bridges, which are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The Fifé section of the bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of concrete.
The project, worth £1.35 billion, is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Treasury Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all demonstrating a truly impressive engineering feat in this project, which has used over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the ground and the bridge can be a demanding operation, requiring the combination of extreme precision measurements.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place and the last part of the concrete is being forged today in Rosyth, which means the entire cover is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the pinnacle of construction technology.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the expanding northern section of the road, we had to close the remaining section on the northern, or inland, side.
This was done by pulling the northern track down 700 millimeters south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding operation.
It's huge because it's 222 meters long from the ground, weighs about 6,000 tons, and it had to be pulled at about 3% of the angle of inclination.
It was demanding because the allowed deviations the team worked on were small, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are dead while alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after they crashed their fishing boat off the coast of England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alarm at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after the crew witnessed the event developing in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat approaching men and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, a pilot on the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Luckily, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got started", he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, a 60-year-old man, was found hanging from a boy with no life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: "These three men who have been in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch, but it somehow got rid of the person who was driving the boat when it crashed.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respected health and happiness hunt.
It's exciting to see the world change.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather spend their leisure time watching the evidence.
Pokémon Go is about getting people off the couch and into some kind of activity.
The time was limited to television, then video games, and more recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity don't interfere.
We're referring, of course, to a wild game called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters originally developed for video games in the 1990s (later to be called cartoons, playing cards, and other expansion packs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat waned before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed because of the huge popularity of the game, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon tracked by GPS and then can be photographed or stolen.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the wild and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, gambling has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the average person.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people who moved 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of Cardiogram-following users.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go. It's only seeing training battle data.
The calls from many public health campaigns to 'find 30', 'go to the couch' and 'go to work every day' have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and are given by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be underestimated.
People who are regularly active have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and its benefits are too numerous to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, the evil pleasure seekers look for things to complain about.
Yeah, someone could walk up to the door.
What about the rest of the time?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity in the past, they didn't give you the reason to move like this game.
The appeal of innovation will disappear and use will decline in time.
However, the success of Pokémon has led to the development of other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunter-loving people to become more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles took gold in women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
He's got a lot of energy.
Running around.
It's incredible.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the world championship on Thursday, putting himself out on the Olympic lightweight podium in the gap between the world and the end of the world.
His total points, 62,198, were clearly better than silver medalist and Final Five team-mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles of the United States is in the women's singles competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back multiple-championships and the fifth American champion overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
She broke down in tears when her final score was announced, and her long journey to this moment ended.
This achievement elevates him to the same level as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their species to a new level:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose combination of ambition and precision has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her the best gymnast I've ever seen.
The final test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the other contestants but between him and the burden of exaggerated expectations.
Returning to the family home in Texas Springs without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States are hugging after winning the gold and silver medals (in this order) in the women's singles competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Oct. 10.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, when he was the top finisher for the national team's retirement coordinator, Martha Carolyn, at the opening ceremony.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future on his long journey to the summit, this is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, including his trademark voltage induction, is adapted to Latin American music that would also perfectly suit the street next to the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and who was discovered by the mother of her coach, Aimee Boorman, while she was in college at the gym where Boorman was training, has become a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a single game since summer 2013, and this winning streak will continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in the lead after two laps, it was just a delusion.
The balance beam and the final, where Biles is the reigning world champion, were waiting.
He climbed to the top with 15,433 points and overtook them with 15,933 points.
Raisman embraced her with goodwill as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose in Biles's eyes, bounded by glitter-red, white, and blue, as the dream he once wrote his playbook about came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of revenge for four years ago when he was in third place but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the relay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "Mother of the Year", was clearly in charge.
He sent out aircrews to the public after his performance of the permance on a radio show, which at times seemed questionable.
As for Bilis, this 19-year-old's widely circulated tweet earlier this week is taking on a whole new meaning:
Three victims of a serial murder were shot while listening to music in their car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest mass shooting in Phoenix in a decade were sitting in their cars talking and listening to music when they were shot, a police statement released Thursday said.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 in a parked car on the driveway.
The report said the shooter, who was standing next to the passenger, fired up to eight rounds into the arm and then fled in another passenger car.
Police say the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take handbags or another adult victim's $2,900.
Phoenix police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to examine whether it was related to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks in four months, two of which have been carried out in the Latin American city neighborhood.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of my home", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators have refused to disclose any evidence that leads to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were killed at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report that the shooting, which occurred just half an hour before the triplets were killed, was the target of an empty van, believed to be the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found the bullet casings, the bullet seat, and the bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: It's getting better
Edmund Picciuto, like most six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a small-headed man, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise you this.
Which is not true at all. Of course I promised, he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a nursing home.
"My reaction was that I didn't know people were still doing it", Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking stick.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with a wheelchair and a bicycle.
Besides, she loves to play with her two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows us how Edmund's inventions refer to the "sing me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But this isn't just a sign language. He's saying Edmund's made up his own sign language.
Microephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as as anthrax or Zika virus.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I just asked what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prophecy in ages because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect that is caused by Zika.
It's going to be a little easier.
You can trust me to make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with additional rain expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their banks, causing widespread flooding due to extreme heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to the counties in need.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Emergency Preparedness and Security, said they're getting requests for upwater vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
Flood control is in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the area is expected to receive another three to five centimetres of rainfall.
In southern Alabama, a floodwaters storm was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a record for flooding over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several homes in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is to flood the lower Ascension County along the river as the floodwaters slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest point on record at nine o'clock Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people up from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his half-brother were among the rescued from Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that normally, at over 400 feet [400 m] from his home, the water in Beaver Creek rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another half-brother who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising", Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had not seen the water of a jar at this high in the 48 years she'd lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all the injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued three people in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says a witness near Livingston reported a 13.75 inch rainfall between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely tired of the heavy rain that continued until Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding in the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that in Tangipaho, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under floodwaters.
County president Robby Miller said that authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been left stranded in the rising waters.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened their gates to those who have been evacuated.
They'll be allowed to return home when the water starts to fall, he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed because of rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood here was in March", said Lacy Landrum, a city administrator.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooding Thursday, but so far, there have been no reports of any flooding on Friday.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and the rain still continues".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which means a second six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
The boy's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that his name was Mahaj Brown.
Brown's parents say he received multiple gunshot wounds, including in the thigh, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
The boy's condition is listed as critical at the hospital, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that they're expecting him to recover.
The boy was about to start his first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three other men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the gunman.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross between several shooters.
The type of shell of the assault rifle, which comes from different assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the aisle.
"It appears that there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a delusional bullet in her arm on Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
So I'm inviting this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been this dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, after all, American.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast in the world has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is so great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but champion weightlifting programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman to win an individual gold in women's singles.
And team mate Aly Raisman won the silver.
We're seeing the peak of the species, but this isn't what it looks like in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went down the same path that Aly and Madison went down when they made the Olympic team.
They're the Final Five because there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's final year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive activity, and gymnasts are usually trained in private gyms run by parents who pay for training, accommodation, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gyms are located in affluent suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
These clubs provide all training for gymnasts, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started training.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible strength training to communities where the many young girls Simon, Gabby and Laurie are passionate about live.
I started my gym foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable training in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my home city, to offer high-level physical education to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic Games.
Strength trainers develop body strength, flexibility, and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits, as well as academic and professional success.
This team's inspiration is getting thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's great.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating a serious virginity by winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to embark on a journey toward a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Doctors practitioners are organizing new strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected.
Ministers had hoped to end the debate on the amendments by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 medical practitioners who voted rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was on unknown ground and that even small additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first practitioners will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to working hours at night and on weekends to improve care during the hours of work.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Medical Practitioners Committee, said last night in her opinion: 'Physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have encountered a reluctance on the part of the Government to participate and, from time to time, deep silence.
And yet, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, eliminate the escape and address the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he doesn't, the medical practitioners are ready to continue the workfight.
The last strike at the end of April involved nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 admissions delays, as nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors on the watch.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association's staff.
BMA wants a better weekend paycheck for the 54,000 doctors under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on practitioners to stop striking.
Mortimer said: 'Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in discussions with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the Guardian and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continuing positive discussion on other important issues - development, flexibility in education, additional training for holiday-goers, training costs, mutual recognition of curricula, freedom of study and gender pay gaps in medicine - would be a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are respecting agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a two-pound daily payment after authorities recommended that people be given it for longer.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another stroke.
NICE, the NHS regulator, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England have a heart attack, and a quarter of them have a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat in the abdominal wall that forms the lining of the abdomen.
If the depression ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can travel with blood and cut off the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British multinational company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely to collapse.
The NICE guidance published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the progress in effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor for the first time, we are satisfied that we can increase the available treatment options for several thousand people who may benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular regarding the risk of bleeding, over three years is limited, the guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness allows for the flourishing of electoral fraud in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, giving a ruling against the government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud being ignored in Muslim communities, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles is accusing police, election commissioners and city councils of ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of racial and religious hypersensitivity.
A former secretary of the community, now the emperor of anti-corruption, said that religious intimidation of voters was so serious that police should be allowed to place security chains outside polling stations to protect fearful voters.
He recommends that voters present their identity cards when they vote to prove who they are.
Today, all a voter has to do is say his name and address.
The report even suggests that the voter's finger be put with an unmistakable black to prevent the two-time vote.
Sir Eric says that whistleblowers should be better protected.
He called for greater access to the press to the documents and decisions of the Commission made by the informal committees or working parties.
This would not only protect local governments from electoral fraud, but it would also protect local governments from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud, he said.
The government ordered the report in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following allegations of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had "manifestly distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have campaigned on the basis that it was a religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Even 300 votes were estimated or the result of a person voting to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about electoral fraud in the mail voting, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, pictured, made a number of recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including proving identity with a personal identification card.
He said:  Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of elders, particularly in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
It was expressed concern that...the state institutions had ignored such behaviour politically correctbecause of racial and religious over-sensitivity.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists handling mail ballots to stop the vote-gathering.
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for stricter controls on registered voters to prevent the use of the electoral registers for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving voter identity before voting.
Use the undefeated black finger of the voting person so no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic national checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made mail-order voices and envelopes in which the voices are sent.
Have the police put chain-guards around the polling stations.
Change the law so it's easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to photograph the polling stations.
Require that the voting places be in English only (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the polls alone.
Sir Eric is raising the police in Greater London, saying it's surprising that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
The electoral court will remain as a result of the numerous corrupt and illegal acts of Lutfur Rahman and his officials, he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without question, according to a criminal record.
He also criticized the ineffective 'square' checks on the voting registers of municipal councils.
Sir Eric said, "The Tower Hamlets verdict of last year was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive campaign of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation.
Mad Cat in the hat and other celebrity appearances photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, Rio 2016 Olympic fans have been confused by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive double.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is certainly not the only gold-medal-winning athlete this summer who can boast of his famous double-header - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the twin of Kate on the wheel, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be a star in Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after he was featured in a photo of himself appearing as scary as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the social media frenzy, the archer admitted that he had heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"But I don't see much of a similarity, except maybe for the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a handsome guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons to London 2012 will surely emerge this year: the startling similarity between British long-distance runner Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The large, glossy face of Russian powerlifter Alya Mustafa is said to be the double act of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger eye change: This user thinks Nathan is the sports version of the Inception actor
Another longstanding comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similarly strong eyelashes and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more in common with Annalynne McCord than brown skin and blond hair, while U.S. team's Nathan Adrian is said by fans to resemble Joseph Gordon Levitt's sporting version.
The tough women: soccer star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, sharing the same facial shape and eyes
Not only that: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw similarities.
Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the two.
A Twitter user recently expressed happiness on the site that some people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.
And the American football star and Dexter's actress have incredibly similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and Gold Medal-winning strength and conditioning athlete Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying a Chinese swimmer died like a pig
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the women's 4x200-meter relay message for the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, instead of the fourth, infuriated CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its reporters said that during the race, a 14-year-old Chinese woman disappeared like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions on the women's 4x200-meter relay final.
MacDonald, who joined the CBC news team to bring in the colors, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old from China is a mess, baby.
He was too zealous. He disappeared like a bad smell. He died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second half time 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch up to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online, shocked by the language and tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.
China's Ai Yanhan was portrayed in the women's 4 x 200-meter relay final as: That little 14-year-old from China was a freak, baby.
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was quick and punitive, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back from hearing how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and making us all sound like a racist gang. #Abomination.
Shortly thereafter, CBC's Scott Russell, who was the host of the show, apologized in a live broadcast for MacDonald's comment: "We're sorry that the comment on the newscast got on the air.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened.
CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comments.
I'm sorry, but my fellow narrator, Scott Russell, had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not his personality.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to clarify his remarks by stating that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message", he told CBC's Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not his personality.
It may be unnecessary to say that I did not mean it disrespectfully and that I am very sorry.
A Primark customer is shocked by a woman who bravely arranged underwear in the middle of a shopping mall.
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman took off her clothes in the middle of the Primark movement to try on her underwear.
But it didn't make any difference. After evaluating her looks in her pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually settled four underwear shops in a store located at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primarck move to Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman made the underwear and then put it back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was at the store, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took off a pair of underwear, undressed her own socks and underwear, and put on her fitting legs.
He didn't even try to find a remote place to reconcile, he just stood there shamelessly.
"Everyone was staring at him as he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like it because he was putting it back on the shelf".
He did the same thing for three more times before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, dressing again, and walking out.
He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he made.
Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn't cleaned.
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I thought the staff were apparently trying to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is good".
It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and not washed them.
A representative for the Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestone Movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All of these products have been withdrawn from the market.
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks by using Krav Magga.
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrach, the Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, in New York, to find out how to deal with rifle-waving robbers in close proximity.
Whether you were approached from before or behind, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
Mizrach says if you're approached from behind, you'll have to turn first to see your attacker and cross the line of fire.
Then you grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue to strike the elbow with your knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to numbness, turn the gun from his hands, strike him in the face with the back of the gun, and turn back, holding the gun toward him.
If an armed person approaches you, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time, put weight on the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the weapon from his grip, back off and point the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing this exactly.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright is scouring Europe 's dirtiest places for a guide .
The British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by swallowing some of Europe's dirtiest and driest places.
Suffolk-based planner and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, would lick a euro note, a flap at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet washer and a Russian public telephone to prove his immune system is strong.
Before he could lick every object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, an experiment that was made into a movie called The Inner Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train wash button used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but the reality is that there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his trip across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he ever licked left him with a bad taste.
Wright became known as a test of his gut's stamina as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, from the railway station curtains to the toilet seat wash button, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said: "Since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health, putting all sorts of things in my mouth, from dust and mosquitoes to boiling water".
He really established his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His specimen had a read of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the number of hands that are crossed should be less than 60.
But at a Russian public hearing, he refused to arrow when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units and the result of the hands that were fired was less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, The Inner Power, with Finnish milkman Valio, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, like the bathroom.
In the movie, the man said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna shoot anything, because it's a nightmare.
The traces of internal power were produced together with the Finnish milkman Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to boost the gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the selection of intermediates, juices and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, but at the same time, it would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: telling our natural environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
Increasing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Director Tom Hakala added: "Let's put it this way: If Ian had swallowed some of the things I asked him to do, like the Russian nightgown shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him".
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved.
In the 2015 SII survey, 84% of respondents identified lactic acid bacteria as specific to stomach and intestinal well-being and 58% said that they use at least occasionally products with lactic acid bacteria added.
A family of mercenaries destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before the eviction.
The family of the gunmen caused £50,000 in damage to their rental home after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being sued multiple times.
After being forcibly removed from the property, the shocked housing company officials declared the property to be in a bad condition.
The walls had been made of openings, the floors were torn, the debris was scattered on the floor, and the walls were crushed with graffiti.
The family has now moved to another location, and they are believed to be living in a private residence.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider here, because this property is probably known for its less-comfortable Cornwall groups.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property at one time, and police said the family's horror included street fighting at baseball fields, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, who was named in the lease, was convicted in June of unsocial conduct.
There were several rooms under the house that were demolished.
The floorboards of the building, which used to handle drugs, were torn up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street and that police were called to the scene regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from their property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors praised the eviction, saying their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
This morning we didn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here. We're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, chief executive of the Cornwall Housing neighbourhood, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family's lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were called to the property often.
The trash and old toys have been thrown down the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: 'It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and that of his or her family, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for their conduct was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police, and the brave members of the community who have given us information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived at the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the frost
Now the employees of the housing company must clean the garbage floors around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as a bag, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to distribute it.
He claimed the money was for the funeral of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner are living homeless after being left in a private dwelling in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house had graffiti on the walls.
The police say they're trying to fire residents who make fun of the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow, a police officer in Devon and Cornwall, said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
'This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequences and to those who suffer from such behaviour,' he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and they will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked when a military jet flew ashore on a low hill
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock in their lives
The Portuguese P-3C Orion would have been swept over from a very low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and said the security was not compromised.
Just at this moment, the panicked tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet was swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military plane coming into close contact with sun worshippers on a sandbar in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they understandably began to worry about the sound of the shower, even though they did not at first see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic passing on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It went through twice very low, and at one point it looked like it was falling to the ground".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane emerged from the darkness and flew in an incredibly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and that the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown much lower than normal because of poor visibility from nearby landfills, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, landslides have destroyed parts of Manner Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to poor visibility, the smoke from the landslides and the thick fog,
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
Exot's first half of the year results better than expected
The Social and Health Service of the Southern Caribbean (Exote) achieved a better result than planned in January-June of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of EXO was EUR 4,3 million in excess in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has led to the dismantling of institutional management.
The warranty was in effect for all operations.
This year, Exote is working to reduce the number of operations.
Exot shall cover the previously created deficit by surplus.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten lines and buy procedures for patients.
The full year's results are forecast to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The Board of Exoto will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces officers took the oath of office in Immola
70 of the Border and Coast Guard Schools took the oath of office on Friday.
A military parade of Border and Coast Guard school cadets was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Medical Course was held at the Armored Training Field.
The oath of office was administered by 70 deputies.
Special border guards are trained for the demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They're on duty 347 hours a day.
This year, 310 young people applied for the position of Special Surgeon.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Specialised icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The ceremony, which was held at the Veterans' Meeting, included five veterans of the Border Patrol during the war.
The average age of the people who were with her is now 90.
The oldest veterans of the service were born in 1918.
The crime reporting helps to investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had a Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA).
The unit's function is invisible to the outside.
The Hemme Police Unit has a total of four police officers in Lahore and Hemme Castle.
It's being pulled by a high-ranking officer stationed in the Gulf.
The head of the oversight is the Commissioner in Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
They all work in civilian clothing.
The unit has demonstrated its reliability and its necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is providing different reports to the other police.
It's not a problem, for example, it's gotten information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
The establishment of the analytical units is the latest reform of the police work.
The goal has been to prevent crime, which means that the police will rarely go to the scene of the shooting until they receive an alarm.
The unit's collection and analysis of information helps to direct daily police operations to where they are most needed.
With the reform of police administration, one Crime Intelligence Centre was established in the country, with fewer than three national units and each police unit with its own Crime Intelligence Unit.
The PTR Centre, which is affiliated to the Central Crime Police, is responsible for national activities.
The PTR units are staffed by the Police, Customs and Border Protection Agency, as their name indicates.
RTAs, in turn, operate in areas allocated by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
Whereas an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of your own institution, because that's what crime does.
The RTA unit has better basic police skills.
The unit uses its records, alert database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive crimes or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it's one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Every human being has his own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in work, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it.
The number of police officers who are being investigated is the highest number of police officers.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around the city with their heads up, but their work isn't entirely public.
The methods used by both the police and criminals are not mentioned, as this could lead to the development of their activities by professional criminals, thus preventing police crime prevention efforts.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they will pose a threat.
For example, a case like this was reported early in the summer, the way empty apartments were marked in home breaches.
The makers put a stick, a button or a tape on the outside door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually traveling.
The preliminary examination shall be made public to at least the interested parties.
The analytics unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most sophisticated of the parties request a copy of the arbitration panel's minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time we go to the thieves, we'll go with our gloves on.
The case was interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppäs from the Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the East Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The Commission therefore considers that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
National cooperation collects information from outside the institution and Finland.
A London school girl who was linked to her parents killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British girls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard her dead in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the country's headquarters.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, died just as he was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
It is only hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a grave grave and a testament to others, that there are real risks involved in going to war zones - that it could lead people to give up on making such a decision, Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East Asian schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland a candidate for the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Senate Democratic Chairman Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will select a person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a phone call Thursday that he predicted with some degree of certainty that Clinton would elect Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said he hadn't spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to move the ship with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hands" and "opportunists".
He said Trump wasn't fit for the job.
Treats says the naked calendar is for women as well as men.
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of being naked, they're going to find the next top-of-the-line generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his page, which is full of nude photos, is different from the old school Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks they have a calendar.
"We must begin to present the timeless and classic nudity once again, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by the images of these nude women's shoes", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can submit images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl records.
Before you attempt to fill in the comments section with angry insults, the author of which is not all-single middle-aged men, notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new discography that has been widely talked about is not because more and more millennials are enthusiastic about the appeal of the new physical objects, but because of the fear of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who recently purchased vinyl vinyl are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy records are 18-24 year olds.
It is also not just about the collection of fans, but also about the sentimental aspect: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in their hearts (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy being alone (69 % vs 66 %).
But are YouGov's results accurate?
If this blog were a television news report, a camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Sohso, wearing a red-grey suit, and before I stop, I would point sharply, form a cup in my hands, and say something prestigious, like, "Let's look at this more carefully".
Let's get to the bottom of this.
At a time when So's charm and dirt are slowly being removed, hotels, chain stores and office supply stores are now filling buildings that once had independent stores. A handful of amazing specialty record shops still remain.
For the next part, I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess their age and emotional parameters by observing.
Stuart, 55, of Glasgow, with me from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
I am, he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which are shown in the picture above (he emailed the sample, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for this huge number of records and singles is partly because of the income he has available: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were first released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and he adds: "I don't smoke or drink much".
This is my fault.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she encounters fit into her YouGov profile.
But he's noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media enthusiasm, people who have heard that records have come back in fashion and who have become desperate to buy their old records back.
Based on my discussions, people have gotten rid of their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl records to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl resuscitations in a given age group.
But what about the supposedly identifiable label on the records?
In a store like Phonic, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community to like-minded people.
Wez said that some older customers were particularly hurt by the closest payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be hooked on the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of their familiar records, items that evoke happy memories of teenage years.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of consolation that is created by owning things", says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" said another employee suddenly from the recording.
An April ICM poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought vinyl records in the previous month had not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% of people have a CD player that they never use, while 7% of vinyl fans do not have a CD player.
At this point, I'd probably look very concerned about the news report as I browse the bossa nova collection.
This "rewarding" aspect of awakening is something Jonny, 42, who also works at Sounds of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a CD player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big part of it, but it's definitely going to happen.
More product, less music.
We get people who say, "I don't have a record player".
So not older people, but younger people, late-teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The Foppi, which now has almost an entire floor on vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements, from the pitch limit to Wild Beast's new synth- and sex-filled pop, and not improvised jazz, it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the painful psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppia for a few minutes, watching the various records on sale.
He's just buying windows, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much, so recording isn't really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the beauty of vinyl is... she screams in love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop is said to have spawned a new generation of vinyl fans, the Urban Outfitters.
While I was trying to look like I was studying horses, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter thought about buying a record player for Crosley.
On the left is a staircase with a wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classical music, any medium-sized album.
No one looks at them, perhaps because they're just ornaments, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's purely vinyl.
But considering that even a small amount of attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers to the deep sea to get more, there's not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the population that has more time and money than others is also the one that uses the most luxury materials, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in SOO's record stores, they do not exclude the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be hardworking in school or in an office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around the record shops on Berwick Street browsing records and avoiding the scary, 30-year-old TV producer's look over the shoulders of this evil-looking middle-aged man.
Holkeri is the longest-lived vertebrate animal in the world.
Scientists say the holker has a longer life span than any other planet's spine.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the record is held by a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters tall.
French court rejects the application to dismantle the jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dissolve a total of 72 temporary businesses where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and cleanup.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the government-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population of the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The Court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 people who were involved in the temporary trade, but said that the concern of the prefect of Calais was fully understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people living in the most insecure conditions.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was under lockdown was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a nonprofit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children's coffee.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people at the Jungle Camp has risen to a peak of 9,000 after arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are falling much faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply for the pleasure of consumers and the discomfort of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5% in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, they have fallen by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food prices have risen by one percent.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen the second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels.
In comparison, only in the UK have food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are from an article by Ilkka Lehtisen, Head of Development at the Statistics Centre, published in the blog Info & Trendit.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to 1994 levels.
It was a very alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership brought us", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, and then food became cheaper year after year.
The price is now weighed down by Russian food import bans that have hampered food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
The big retailers S Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
The consumer has seen the price competition as the most prominent advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a food hub, despite the large decline in food prices.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with similar wages to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the value added tax has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, the same countries would sell the cheapest food in Finland at a third rate.
The paper translated Finland into Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the countries of the comparison were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition", writes Lehtinen.
The newspaper notes that its calculations of VAT as a percentage are indicative.
School ain 't what it used to be .
A return to school may notice a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be implemented at the beginning of the term in all primary schools.
It is the guideline for all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in the works for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, they're giving up teaching fine writing and instead starting to practice coding in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade and social studies in the fourth grade.
The main change, however, is the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived spine found in the world, a shark can live up to 400 years.
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), which is well-known, does not reach sexual maturity until 150 years of age.
It may live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the wild, it is only surpassed by the Icelandic pear, whose oldest known individual is dated 507 years old.
Greenland shark swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females can stretch dogs longer, reaching up to over five centimeters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, only about an inch a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified the adult icefish from 28 females that had been caught by the fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiation exposure of the eye lenses.
The average life span of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian fish, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice cubes reach sexual maturity at just over four centimeters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman fired nearly 300 salesmen .
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off by Stockmann, a department store company.
The joint ventures, which were in trouble, closed in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, most of which will be laid off", Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of sellers of warehouses will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, some 80 support staff are offered new sales jobs.
Stockmann's negotiations involved some 3 000 workers.
At the time of their introduction, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in manpower will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme with a target of EUR 50 million in savings this year.
The reason for this is Stockmann's difficulty in making a profit from the goods store.
Although the Group's operating profit improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the goods trade is still losing.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalaisen, the sales in the warehouses have not reached the company's objectives.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the impact of the measures on the environment.
The second quarter's performance improvement was mainly due to the success of the Lindex clothing chain.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter revenue and earnings.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating income is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the northern hemisphere with temperatures below 20 degrees across the country.
The centre of low pressure over northern Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, reports HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
It's also raining in the central part of the country, but it's warmer in the south.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as the country's mercury levels are below 20 degrees.
In the northern rainy areas, it'll be 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is fueled by a doping scandal, a strange explanation for a coach's deception.
Kenyan general-sport coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah had performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform at is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team manager Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had taken a sample of Rotichin in a surprise test.
Doping officials have been to Anzrahi to report the incident.
I told him Anzrah was sent home because he "crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, even signed documents.
We cannot tolerate this kind of behavior", Kip Keino, president of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that very moment.
It's still unclear if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at last year's World Championships and is already the Rio winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan national team claimed that Anzrah had acquired an athlete's credit card only to get free meals in the village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for testing.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he feared it would be revealed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
The Rio General Stadium is ruining its void
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching the Olympics.
On Friday, the Rio Games began with a competition for the world's top sports medals, but the world's top teams were able to showcase their skills to a stunningly empty audience.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day of matches were sold and 65% of the tickets for the evening matches.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was crowded with cheering crowds.
Tickets to the finals are sold out in Rio.
The number of spectators at the Rio Olympics has been highlighted even before the Olympics.
For example, rugby, melon, and riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazil's medal-winning teams Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach soccer in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the viewership was filled.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seat crowd was only about 30 percent full.
At least the reason for the bad performance is that Brazil, struggling economically, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to football-savvy Brazilians.
Even the first match of the Brazilian national football team, however, was not allowed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, the race organisers' spokesman, said over the weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold by then, a significantly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell", Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have fluctuated from about nine euros to over one thousand euros for the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
The stadium in Rio had enough empty seats in the morning.
Even beach soccer on the sands of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Central competed in London in 2012.
I've had enough people with the papers.
A new way to protect nature - to get land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to the conservation of nature by new means.
The Foundation, which was set up last year, is acquiring ecologically important natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem land rights in cash.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be purchased for a fee.
The holder shall be granted a right of veto for a block of 187 square metres, which means that in practice, each holder does not need approval if the land use is to be changed.
The holding rights may also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be inherited or given as a gift.
No need to go carrying flags or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviägas, who acquired the management rights for his company.
The acquirers of the management licence receive accurate location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website lists the names of the acquirers of the rights in the same map as the block of land.
Leviäkangas sees its conservation project as a risk only if the Foundation changes its activities from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a public benefit foundation dedicated to promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that shouldn't be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Guardian project is based on the protection of natural areas in a way that they remain intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of shareholdings, but the Foundation has its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to move beyond Finland's borders and plans to buy land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Mall from 13 to 19 August.
The worst torment of big cities is for bicycle thieves. Look at your home.
Bicycle thieves torture Turku worse than any other major city in Finland.
This year, more wheels were stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, the Helsinki Gazette found out how many bicycles and parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January and August this year, per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to the fortune, Helsinki, Oulu and the Gulf rose to the top.
According to police, four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 residents occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvolas, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
I mean, that's a big difference.
"In other cities, the number of burglaries relative to population is double", describes Police Commissioner Tommi Reen.
The police in the city are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It's extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than anywhere else.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by the amount of cycling in the city and the number of wheels at all", reflects Chief Officer Teemu Äikäs.
The police authorities, Tommi Reen, have long expected Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top.
The number of bike thefts is largely dependent on which cities are the study and cycling cities.
There's a narrow center in the market, short distances, and plenty of wheels for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very special city, with city centers far apart and bicycles not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In Finland, the number of bike thefts in January and August was slightly lower than in the same period last year.
There's no reason to be so happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
That's 50 to 60 dollars a day, and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 bicycles a year.
"It's a lot of money", Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, since only a small percentage of victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime of bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are ever reported.
A typical known bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the act.
"Cases are also being investigated in other cases, such as when stolen wheels can be found in a drug case", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly in the course of their own work or in the course of a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that wheels are stolen from, for example, shopping malls' wheelbases, courtyards, warehouses and wheelbases, or virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
The most stolen bikes in the world are the Jopoes, like in previous years.
The U-Lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
For example, some thieves take a bicycle for short-term use, but a large proportion of stolen bicycles end up being sold online.
They'll stay in the home market.
"At least the police have not learned that stolen wheels are rarely exported", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of you may have doubts.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, for he may be guilty of concealment or breach.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a discount", says Reen.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colorful knife for the protection of the Kallion Library in Helsinki every day of his working life.
He has had five bicycles, but none stolen, says Hirvi. "Never taken, but he's a good monk".
"Maybe this isn't so much a thief's attraction, it may not have any hysterical value", reflects the Helsinki Deer.
A quick-selling Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Helsinki's Kallio, locked his bicycle in a small U-lock.
Now the bike is pushed against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike to something solid, like a wheelbarrow.
"It's a lot to think about because this bike is the most expensive thing I ever owned", says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, which cost about five hundred euros a hull alone.
"My friends keep telling me the wheels have been taken".
"Somehow bad wheels, like those back-to-back Jopoes".
The vigilante himself was stolen a bicycle from the home company's yard a year ago.
The wheel had been unlocked, though, so Valve was able to wait for it to be seized.
Under 15 for crimes they're responsible for?
Helsinki is testing the US-based rivals
In Helsinki, a so-called 'equal-law' team is being set up to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment was applied to those under 15 years of age who are now free of criminal liability.
The jury is missing the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that a jury of your peers discuss what happened with the perpetrator and issue a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator may join a jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to a family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, director of the Youth Action, says the model is not rigid.
We have other mediation models that are used in conjunction with each other.
"Everything is directed to a more responsible direction of youth activities so that everyone does not get ruined by the first mistake", says the Act.
The equivalent body has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not get in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with approximately his or her peers.
The model has been tested once.
According to the service designer Iikka Lovio, who supervised the experiment, the abuse was successfully solved.
Especially the first crimes of children under 15 may not have been addressed at all.
"It has been a message that you continue on the path you choose", Lovio says.
The Ombudsman's Office is part of the Migrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, an open letter was sent to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to go to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, along with his indifference, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor, threaten to cause a vote-off for Democrats in this election", the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can stop Republicans from drowning the Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
The letter said the decision shouldn't be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent out within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians such as Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is clearly Trump-opposing Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials in the country announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to American families with children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I was running for president to make sure the American economy worked out for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for the rich and in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-training program for American dunes who suffer from the factories' move to cheap labor lands.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We're a building crew. We have to go back to building!
Clinton said that.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the status of working-class families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, by the way, when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax fugitive, it has to pay exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the free trade agreement he once supported.
"As president, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculation in the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed tax cut has been described by Clinton as "Trump's pigtail".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was herself the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid and clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton whispered.
The following are the number of viewers in Rio: The Finnish people are not tied to the boxes, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports games are usually shown in TV viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached a record-setting audience.
Once, the races have been held at the edge of the boards by at least 12% of the population: on Tuesday night, the swimming was watched by 615,000 people on the Olympic Channel on TV2.
For comparison: the EM World Cups last month attracted almost 800 000 viewers at a time on TV2 and the EM World Cups in football attracted another million.
So far, the Olympics have been dominated by Sunday night cycling and the fifth-day opening of the broadcast, both of which reached an audience of nearly half a million on the Olympic Channel at a time.
General Manager Panu Pokkinen of Yle Sports is pleased with the audience and reminds that for the first time, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We're happy with the number of TV viewers who are actually going to the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports events for which Yle has owned a full channel.
When the show is on 24 hours a day, and the viewership is 20,000 to 500,000, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly due to the time difference - a large part of Rio's racing broadcasts are in Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now considers it a lack of interest - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, interest would have jumped upwards with it.
Furthermore, public sports are just beginning, as are other Finnish sports of interest: sailing and horse riding.
The initial viewership has been close to what Pokki said.
When the sport starts, the numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the early days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"We'll get the network viewership figures later", Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as desirably for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has arrived and the error has been corrected.
The Rio Arena has been delayed and other minor technical problems at the beginning.
The applications have been updated and should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen on the Yle Canal and Arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and Yle Talk broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the busiest Yleu ever, but also the last to be followed only from Yleu's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be available on both Yale and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the lake of the Sun, which is 95.3 metres deep on the island of Kristilla.
It could be deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found a 20-square-foot [20 m] weight on the cross, which the dive computer measured to a depth of 104 feet.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried in vain to confirm the observation by sounding a bell.
The method may not be found at a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 m) and Suvas Water (90 m).
The Saimaa, Second Water and Main Lake are more than 80 metres in length.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunflower.
The bottom of Lake Inari has not been mapped accurately.
"There might well be unknown depths", Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean latitude, it's the Great Lakes, 23 meters.
So your sun will not be among the ten deepest, and the spring water is farther from the edge.
Correction, August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: The last paragraph corrected where the deepest lakes in the mid-latitude were wrong.
The tax rate is flattering: the tax rate for pensioners is still tightening
The tax rate for pensioners remains more stringent than for employees.
Ihalainen says that the disadvantage was highlighted under parliamentary votes and that pensioners were promised equal taxation to payroll.
The Government's proposal does not contain such a statement.
We think it should definitely be in there.
The promises made should be kept after the election, he told Western Media.
Earlier this year, wage earners received a reduction in earnings, which eased their tax burden.
The issue was heated in the House by opposition representatives who were bemoaning the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubby (co.) about the election promises.
Buying power is secure, it's not growing
The Commission considers that the Commission's proposal to extend the exemption from tax to the State aid granted to the State in the form of a reduction in the amount of the aid granted to the State in the form of a reduction in the amount of the aid granted to the State.
He says that tax cuts have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's insecurities.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competition agreement reached during the difficult times.
He says that keeping a deal is important to credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It is done by the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Ihalainen urges the government to tackle longterm unemployment in budgetary conflicts, at least to halt its growth.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be elusive.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the future.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to exercise vigilance and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
While there is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip due to the explosions, the embassy's guidelines on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish tourist season in Thailand is the turn of the year.
Most Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at this time.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the perpetrator
Westphalen said there's no information yet on who carried out the attacks.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in divided society in Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The bill passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In one country, people were arrested for speaking out against the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, ethnic and national conflict is being waged over Muslim populations, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations in the past.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The impact on the course of the day will be such that the authorities will be extremely strict about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and were different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been shut down, according to the AP, Thailand's police news agency.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the past 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in popular tourist destinations such as Phuket and Hua Hin.
At the popular tourist destination of Finland, Phuket, four bombs exploded in the night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination Hua Hin has been hit by four bombs, according to local authorities, both yesterday and today.
In each of the twin bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the southern Thai village of Surat Than and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in both.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Many tourists also know Surat Thani, which is the gateway to the holiday islands of Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The assailant is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of Thailand's ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks has not yet been identified.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We can't get people to panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Minister of Security, at least Hua Hin and Tran's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the attackers were intended to destroy the country's tourism industry because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to exercise vigilance and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
The Finns who intend to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the nighttime attacks in Finland and their victims.
We've been able to get a little more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
In the last attack on Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near the famous watch tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The governor of Surat Than said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
The strike killed a city employee.
At least one person is injured.
The police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple sculls.
The United States' Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russia's Aliya Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Games for breeding championships in the floor, jump and pole vault.
Biles has been a master of women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He's won eight individual world championships in three years.
He has won the championship of the four-man event and the downhill event three times in a row, and the last and second year of the pole vault.
With the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The best World Cup medals in Biles are the jump and the jump.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Sky has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think there will be any more miracles", said Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some 20 years.
An experienced businessman has witnessed many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these two have not driven out tourists before, this one hardly has.
The office of the Hoovila company is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
The housekeeper heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 local time and said he shouldn't come to the office.
The official said that both the beach and the main road on Bangla Road were completely closed early this morning due to the attacks.
A lot of my local employees came to work this morning in the usual way.
They thought the road signs were set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to a Friday holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm, and traffic on the main street was allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many on the beach had never even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 a.m. Thai time, traffic in Patong had returned to normal and most shops had opened.
According to the site, the explosion was quite small, says Huovila, a visitor to the site.
Later, the car in question was seen at the Crown Supper in Jouxholm.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The police spotted two identifiable men hiding in a nearby six-room apartment.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of operating a motor vehicle, stealing and causing grievous bodily harm.
The police are grateful for any leads.
Research Director on the changes in leadership in Russia: Clearly moving away
Russia's most senior leadership change in years came on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired its chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino, of Estonian descent.
He's a former diplomat who served as Ivanov's second in command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that redirecting managerial functions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to stop people from claiming power independently of the president.
According to Kangaspur, it's also possible that Ivanov has been involved in a fight with other executives or screwed up.
The station is closed to Ivanov.
Ivanov, who is now part of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special environmental and transportation duties.
In a video of the state media, Putin declared the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him with the "Vino", Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear demise.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priority list.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people in Russia at the height of its power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönimy of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's successors is that Putin changes his neighbors to younger ones.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in their retreat in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the town of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars that took them to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of Manbij, an important city for the Islamic State, last week.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Previously on 7:30 p.m.: We had previously misrepresented civilians fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior's document disclosure line is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's line on the publication of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The voter tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authorities' own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the State Council Office and that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has seen a need to reform its practices.
The last Olympics for Usain Bolt are starting in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time in a value-added race.
He was offended from the start by his backpack and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key", Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included light-skinned sambatans and fan-turned reporters.
The burden surrounding Bolt underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when general sport has struggled with doping scandals and growing interest.
Bolt's last Olympic loss came in Athens in 2004, when he ran 21.05 in the 200-meter dash.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promising man who was slowed down by injuries and a lazy training position.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, breaking the world record and ending the competition's confidence with a time of 9.69.
This is harder .
A year later, at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career high in clock measurement.
The world records, set in Berlin at 9,58 metres and 19,19 metres, are still in place.
Riossa Bolt has announced his ambition to set the world record in the 200 meters and 19 seconds under, but no one believes it will be achieved except Bolt himself.
The 100th most challenging Bolt is the 2004 Athens Olympic 100th Justin Gatlin.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has never lost a single final of the Beijing Games since he took office, if he's ever made it.
In the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Bolti was left out of the race because of a cheating accident.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Uranus' final goal line is Bolt's next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm under, I remind myself: this year, I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, the state news agency, the 18-year-old Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
A sample of Chinese drug user Chen Xiny was found to contain prohibited substances.
I also suspect Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was deported for doping on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of an epo-hormone.
She placed fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese woman has taken her doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Sports Appeals.
Xinhua reports that a sample taken by Xiny on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female bodybuilder Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya has been granted a visa to return to the home of a sports coach from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given doping evidence in his favor.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprint trainer John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rothschild's race slip.
Nothing stops Phelps from making history .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps swam the 200-meter dash in his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win the same Olympic gold in four consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix, ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun. I'm having a laugh at the BBC Olympic science commentator Helen Skelton in the Sunday Evening Post short interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (pictured) on Monday is the most read story on the Sunday Times website this week.
Next up is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much of a stressor if there is a small compliment in the Somme or British press on his revealing and special outfits.
TV is visual media, he's insisting.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short-heeled dress that is certainly at least enough exposure to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small bags are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to tune in and maybe even surprise you, but he's insisting he doesn't want to be in the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and we need to focus on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the elevator reaching Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is fine with me, Skelton's fart.
You know what? I'm gonna...
It's a dish out of nowhere when it comes to dressing.
I'm a little bit amused if this one hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on terrorism charges.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on terrorism charges.
Police made the arrests in connection with the race's security.
Police made five other arrests in connection with the same incident and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the terrorism detainees are members of the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to be connected to the Islamic State.
The detainees were reportedly inciting violence on social media.
The messages calling for violence were circulated on, among other things, the recommended WhatsApp service.
The Rio Games are being held in the hands of 85,000 police officers.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their opening match of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed it to the public.
Police allowed the public inside after they had controlled the package.
This was the third time in Rio's Olympic history that police have conducted a controlled explosive.
Police have closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlled the package.
The crowd didn't stop watching the game until the start of the game because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package that was found in their possession.
The police blew up the package and only then let it into the audience hall.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race in a sleepy way.
With two losses, Spain, who started the race, beat Nigeria by 96-87.
In the previous two games, Spain won silver.
Police have conducted a controlled explosive operation for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police detonated a suspicious find near the destination of a road cycling event was last Saturday.

The Argentine lady blew up the Traitor Siren . The Finnish man was planning a protest .
The wind at Cheater-Siren was a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The Traitor-Sire wind was strong on Thursday.
An Argentine lady blew the Traitor Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted to breach.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told us.
The athlete has been considering a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get my compensation, Cheater-Sire said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last minute, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish man was left in the car with a car on his way to seat 27.
In total, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is eighth.
The crash didn't really affect the pain.
Friday's a big day, so we're racing for the 10th-12th.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first report, the Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life is prolonged.
And sometimes things that a person cannot control themselves can bring him years to live.
These include the tendency to be overweight or obese.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always have to even bother. Just pick up a milkman.
The long-standing mystery has been solved through a variety of investigations.
The Medical Daily has released seven of the strangest findings.
Science says all these things could add years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee intake has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer' s and Parkinson' s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially for neurological or heart disease.
Studies, again, speak for alcohol, showing that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental use can extend a person's life by up to six years, says one study.
The argument is that this prevents the spread of infections.
They, in turn, can promote the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project was followed by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Gender, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
Besides, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have an extra year of life, he must also have an orgasm.
I'm sure professionalism will bring you more years, and there's no denying that.
However, longevity does not require absolute diligence.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a low mortality rate.
Whether it's an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he's more likely to live longer than the average bottleneck.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity is a result of a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to seek recognition, such as a Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that those who shop daily are less likely to shop as parents.
This is because running a concrete store reduces loneliness.
It has been shown to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death.
So, if you count your credit card out of your hand, then online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver who was a goddamn drunk collided with a truck .
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred in the Kosk of Varsina-Finland.
The accident happened in Kosk, Koskenti and Sorvaston on Friday at 9:00 p.m.
The truck was heading towards Forssa when the passenger car came to the same road, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was parked on the side of the road after the collision, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car went up the aisle and then over the aisle to the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 and was driving a private car was crushed by a car.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the car and took him to the Central University Hospital in Turin for treatment.
The woman's breathing test was 2.02 promile.
He's under suspicion of driving under the influence.
The post office sent the wrong city with the card.
The list of exit cards of Salon K-Citymarket was incomplete because the postal service had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjo.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernion, was shopping for a set of discharge cards at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages on the freight lines because the Post delivered our cargo to the Wall Street!
We'll get more when the mail gets the load delivered!
So unless there's a traffic jam in the lawn, the sign says.
The company's flag is associated with the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The Post will always have grass cutters until the end of August.
Haltian thought the sign was mostly funny, and he decided to share it on social media.
I was so impressed with the updates.
The media has been on the phone all the time, and the attention this has brought to the matter is incredible, Halti wonders.
Last Friday night, Halti's update was shared on Facebook by over 700 people.
Haltia got her favorite stuff stuck in a bag of candy, even though a few of the cans were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of Postal Enterprises, apologized to Ilta-Sanom for the damage.
The fact is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (The River of the Plains) and we didn't go to the third stage (The Hall) anymore, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first thing that came to the news was the Evening News.
Teja Halti wasn't mad at the sign because she found all her own scissors in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, who weighed 30 pounds, posted a photo of her change.
The comic book producer has lost tens of pounds since the birth of her baby.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of the couple's change on Instagram on Friday.
Last spring, Lotta was on a skirt and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in the year 2014.
Comedian, television producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss career back in 2009.
She's a total lifestyle change and she's lost a little, quietly, 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lot has changed over the years.
Backlund's before and after photographer has collected a number of appreciative comments from national lifeguards.
You are so beautiful.
We're on the same road, motivation is strong!
Pija Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were all involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I myself go to heaven on the same journey, another tells me.
Last spring, Lot lost the last few pounds on the Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Evening Post that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then 10 pounds.
In three months of hard work, I finally lost five pounds.
The family of the woman murdered in Lovice wishes:
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Lviv hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by donating to a police documentation.
The Sipoon Veterinary Medical Center has released a Facebook update to express the wishes of the victim's family about the donations to the police.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute in Sipo's veterinary practice and also completed her nursing training there.
The vet's office reminds me of a woman with touching words.
He's cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor, and he's not afraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation funds will go entirely to police departments, primarily for the purchase of security.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Lovisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors told the Evening News that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cocks.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was fatally injured in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled that Post had infringed the Equality Act.
The postal service had no right to withhold the wages of employees who refused to familiarize themselves with the hired worker, the Kanta-Häme Court of Appeal ruled.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the remuneration and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
The judgment stated that Posti could have withheld only a proportion of the employee's salary corresponding to the employee's share of the day's work.
The appellant submits that the employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position because of his trade union activities, which was contrary to the Equality Act.
The worker had complied with the PAU's organizational decision to ban the introduction of the postal and logistics union.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU decided that Post employees should not contact the employees who broke the strike.
People's News first reported the incident.
Turkey returning to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to a democratic and human rights-respecting development path, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (French) in their reply to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The press association had earlier asked Sipil and Soin in a letter to express their concerns about freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini emphasize the importance of freedom of the press and expression in Turkey, as Finland has repeatedly stressed.
Putin has removed the head of his administration from power .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin has said.
The Soviet Union's Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will take the place.
Ms. Saino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
Vinayos will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close associate of Putin, will be transferred to special environmental and transportation duties, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him with the "Vino", reports Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev was elected president.
Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
The BBC Man U's giant prize for gambling won't be seen at the Premier League opening.
The world record holder for the football transfer will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed England.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is banned from the game as ManU opens their season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba a €105 million loan to Juventus in Italy, according to the British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game as he was banned from Juventus.
He got two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it's gonna be a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA has told the BBC.
Pogba's next match is in round two of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
Flow's madness of magnitude is a virtue.
The precise criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival's status as an internationally respected event, with the world's leading artists.
Flow Festival is starting on Friday in Helsinki.
Party writers have typically expressed themselves in self-taught dress.
One of the main performers on the scene this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area will be decorated with art installations and sculptures.
"It's never been enough for us to just have a headboard and a beer tent", says the event's artistic director, Toomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Helsinki's Suvi Bay, has grown from a small block party to an event attended by tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
It's kind of weird in the events industry to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act according to the authorities' regulations, says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out this year.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors last year by 70,000 by 5,000.
This year's festivals will also see a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing, because you have to finance the work somehow.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like cattle rustling in a vast lane.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been amplified over the past 13 years by 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and bars in the partly artificial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance halls, this year's venue will be a 15,000-person tent.
The Rock admits that the event could be more simply realized.
I may be a little bit of a big-ass, but we've managed to keep Flow's spirit alive.
If it's lost, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for Kalli is that even great visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, activities were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the holding company operating Flow had a turnover of around EUR 6 million.
It can produce "crisis things", such as the construction of that 100-foot-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-stamped dress.
Alongside the music scene, we can also talk about a community of trending young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out, above all else, in content.
Yet, fashion also fits Flow's values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main performers is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
According to Rock, Iggy was booed because this is probably the last time you'll see him perform in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is a hell of a good one, and he's done some hell of a lot of shows over the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the bushes.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night local time.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bomb was apparently hidden in a flower bed and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
From 1989 onward, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a much talked about picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can watch it from here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded near the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar squares, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one of them died.
We don't know how many people were injured.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, a popular destination for Finns.
No one is reported to have died.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one person was killed and three wounded.
And in the city of Trang, there was one bomb.
Police said they had discovered at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet exploded.
The Thai authorities say that the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces that are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership's actions.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been increasingly involved in the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the paratroopers are not called to combat until several months after taking the oath of allegiance, reports the Central Finn.
According to the head of training for the Armed Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat, for example, among the paramilitaries who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the head of training, the first assignment is to the reserves of the reserve forces.
"No one in the reserves or in the reserves is assigned to a mission without the training they need", Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it was revealed that the Defense Force will begin training its paratroopers for immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used for military operations as needed during the training of paratroopers.
Pamela Tola was given a huge amount of money for her home tax.
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, director Pauli Waroma, have won a penalty for the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The two-storey detached house had a retail price of EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious humidity problem was discovered in the house, which caused a health-damaging microbial growth site.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a disposable property in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of EUR 198 000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price cut from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the plaintiff's and the court's cases.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal ordering the seller to pay a discount of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller has to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs totalling EUR 47 344.
The court granted a slight price reduction because some of the need for repairs had already been known to buyers when the housing was sold.
However, the Court of Justice held that the construction errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
So , look for a good home .
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a comfortable home because they did not want to start repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good condition and was in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the inspection report were not inconvenient.
The risk and inconvenience mentioned in the land survey report were ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater along the cliffs.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock might have to be diverted slightly within a few years.
The transaction was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the humidity problems in the apartment were far more serious than previously thought.
During inspections in 2012 and 2013, the site was found to contain microbes, which the Witnesses said were caused by both rocky rainwater and capillary uplift.
The inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could have entered the interior through the porch.
Over-the-counter, hypoglycemic, or hypoglycemic, was found in samples of siding in the household, basement stairwell, living room window frames and basement laundry room.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputeed whether the extension of the building was contrary to the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the Espoo City's decision to make changes to the condominium prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though proper permits had not yet been issued.
However, home issues were a key issue in the court case.
According to the Court, the buyer could, on the basis of the information obtained from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no immediate need for substantial repairs.
The Court of Justice found that Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out the usual wider examination.
The buyer has not failed to comply with the deposit obligation, the court said in its judgment.
A horrific record-keeping: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - including Finns -
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, reporter Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilm records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi race agency.
The Bureau of Race was under the command of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of even larger numbers of women who were expected to be able to give birth to up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The Office of Race Research investigated women's background, including through research of church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews among the women.
Women also had to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Bureau of Race Records a handwritten life cycle and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Office wanted assurances that the women were "child-loving", "spend-saving", and "good national socialists", who spoke German well.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids of SS men.
The case does not mention the fate of the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
Lebensborn families provide for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, reports the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting the birth of children.
The German Mother's Medal was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum says.
As the sixth of the Traitor-Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first leg of the Finnjolli day sailing event at the Rio Olympics, but was knocked out in the second leg of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the second start failed to place him at 14.
The Wind Betrayer-Sire fought off the RSX Day Departures in 17th and 3rd places.
In the overall standings, Cheater Siren is sixth.
In the 470th grade, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening day.
In the overall standings, the Lindgrens are in 19th place.
The recording of the Satellite's body was made a couple of hours into the night: "I was so in a corner".
Jari Brillanpää has been one of Finland's favorite artists for over 20 years.
Having gone from a cruise ship barman to the king of tangok in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and a star of dance clubs and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to climb and is currently on a high climb.
The book, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of her favorite singer Jari Brlanpää - Paljaana, was released today.
In the book, Bridgehead tells of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career rose to a total boost when he won the crown of the Tang Dynasty at the Tang Market in 1995.
At the race, the bridgehead sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a piece for the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen had arranged into a slightly different shape.
The song "Saturn" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible cramp and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so upset!
The bridgehead is in the book.
If you had a hit recording, you wouldn't know it was a pop song.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to be perfect and top-notch all the time.
The second incident in the book about the man's most popular verses happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Brillanpää divorced his then-partner and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics that Sara Törmämäs had ordered were not what Bröndby had hoped.
Bridget had imagined that she was making a record that told the true story of her own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper's news report said that Jarin and his ex-girlfriend had divorced because of excessive partying and alcohol abuse, but Jarin said that it was a complete hoax and not true.
Jari, according to the book, was furious about the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he decided to sing it, and that's fine.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters supported the split and 48% would have remained in the Union, despite the fact that the opinion polls of the voting week predicted the opposite outcome.
The UK economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No reputable research institution or university has spoken out in favor of the divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers have expressed disagreement with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" was thrown into the garbage can in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is looking at the answers to the Brexit disaster from the professional community.
The typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists have for losing their position in the economy is that people don't understand economics.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, so it is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the idea that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it would boost the export industry.
The Commission considers that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists was insufficiently high.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's fairness, which gave as much room to economists who favored EU differences as to the overwhelming majority representing only a few percent of the Economic Committee.
The anti-EU press was not interested in commenting on the consequences of the divorce by the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic literature bodies.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they didn't care because economists represent an elite with whom voters don't think they have a common interest.
The academics of big cities like the Economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy too.
The main argument for the Brexit vote was immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant cuts through your hospital, an immigrant exploits you.
These arguments are valid.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center's waiting room is full of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were thrown out?
Every town has foreigners.
How much more space would the Aborigines have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They cover jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists were unable to answer them, and if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that immigrants have made Britain more employable, less well-being-centered and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are the net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund was set aside for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish firm Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that the Aberdeen plan was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan B, or the pro-EU split, was prepared for a victory a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds out of the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have adequate liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily listing of real estate funds that the news touched on.
The old man said the normal rate would be 15 to 20 percent.
The value of the fund at the time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even less.
The real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the pro-EU divide camp won, Europe went to hell.
However, the two weeks of voting in the real estate market were rather quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they plundered the situation and took the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was directly compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This is making investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors became nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one by one.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash it had raised, but it also ended up freezing its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close the deal, they changed the pricing down.
In practice, he gave investors time to consider whether it was worthwhile to panic-out the money.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of them cancelled the announcement.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now for a couple of weeks it has been very calm, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such debasement in Aberdeen's Manner European Funds.
But there were a lot of questions.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
The old man said that the closure of the real estate fund transactions received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen closed for six days and the company sold less than 10 properties out of 80 in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might be holding its fund closed for the second half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The exchange rate between the red and the dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and the market is experiencing a 15% drop in sales compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% less.
There are many willing buyers, says the Old Man.
Brexit has had a negative impact on the London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't look very strange.
But on the fourth day, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
I thought that was the strength of your head.
I realized this is going to be a plan B thing, says the old man at his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already completely alive, despite the morning.
The normally silent television screens in the office produced news, and the usually loud crowd was completely silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his departure.
When the markets opened, the screens were all red.
It was a morning I never thought I'd live, says the Old Man.
Nor did Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, complete two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, despite the milling.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and so the situation was somewhat peaceful, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote has begun a corrective movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The point collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market began to see sharp declines in the UK and particularly in the London real estate market.
London office space was forecast to decline by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is gone, but the air is still uncertain.
It's not like it's on the faces of the old man who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
He believes that it is too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
There is so much still to be done: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The first reports on the development of the London real estate market have already been received.
The information on price developments from CBRE, a real estate services company, covers about a third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent between June and July.
In the City of London, the mine has accumulated 6.1% of the mine, the Old Man lists.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're changes in the monthly.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and has only been worse in five months, says Vanhanen.
All the same declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the fall of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the illustration is not quite right, because this is the British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now seen not panic sales like it did at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
I'm not sure if you can afford it.
The repair operation could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he is not surprised by the price correction movement - one that could have been possible without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world's leading cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started off really high.
London's prices have risen for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The UK economy has grown strongly, so has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership to go global, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment opportunities abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to seek profits from new items.
On top of that, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhasen, the debt burden has been used much less now than it was during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
♪ Dispersed, dispersed ♪
In London, prices have been steadily rising since last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen started to lighten its holdings in London, and last year, there were net sales.
There was a twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old Man.
He's not afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly any bullshit.
The mood suggests a downward or steady direction ahead.
The old man has seen more ups and downs since he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that working out the mines is the only way to survive.
If you're prepared for the risks well, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If it's decreased, then the risks are decreased, says the Old Man.
S-group will start recording purchasing data more accurately than ever before
Soon, the S-Group will know what you're eating, because today, the retail group announced that it's starting to gather more information about its target customers' purchases.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start to collect it for purchased products in early May.
The S-group follows Kesko in this regard, as the information on the goods purchased on the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have ever banned the use of product data, Riitala told the Economic Gazette.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in registration of the S-group.
Kesko already classifies its target customers into 10 groups based on their food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
The number of customers is also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent.
The data will be used for customer-targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data shall only be collected from the own chains of the K group.
The Commission has also concluded that the Commission is not interested in the possibility of using the information provided by the Commission.
Lidl Finland does not have a port customer programme and does not have one planned for this year.
The Finnish local market has its own Single Bonus Programme, which can be accessed in the Electoral Houses, Siwo and Euromarket.
We're not currently collecting product or product group information, we're staying at the end-of-year level.
So we know where the shop was, and we know the day of the purchase, and we know the customer's receipt.
"We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group", says Anu Ora, commercial manager.
He said the customer support programme is to be renewed in the future, but the local shop will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not allow for the registration of product information.
Start with the experiment.
SOK's client and owner register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information also includes occupation, education, residence, years of birth and previous personal data.
The same persons and their roles are also registered.
The S-Signal Card Shop records the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchase and the payment method.
In addition, the information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
Starting in early May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, for S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, the data is for the time being recorded at product group level.
The aim of the project is to improve the quality of the services provided by the public sector.
S-Group says they're informing their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is in the vaults anyway, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the data stored on the S-group websites.
For example, the banks cannot access the data, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila Puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first exploding puppy
The black Labrador's puppy sniffs five similar land-lined boxes at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it's firmly seated next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite game.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a bottle of scented scented gas.
"Food gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now", says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to the e-commerce
Heila is the first dog in the customs service to specialize in weapons and explosives and will be deployed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Heila and Suntie may also be transferred to other border crossing points and ports where necessary.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks were the subject of a number of measures by Customs and controls have been tightened since the attacks, says Inspector General of Customs, Mikko Grönberg.
The second way to train the armed and detonation forces in customs is through the port of Helsinki.
With the increase in e-commerce, up to 40 million mailings are sent through the airport each year, possibly including foreign-ordered equipment and explosives.
In recent years, customs have made online purchases, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport, including about 300 items related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials.
Heila will be working in different parts of Helsinki Bay.
It's gonna be looking into all the checked baggage and mail.
In the future, it will be of great benefit to the port sector by allowing it to go through large container areas and to mark areas that require further investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the Heila, Customs is assessing whether more weapons and detonation dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School at the Church
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull School for Dogs in the Church.
Suntio also trains with Heila at the police and defense forces' specialists.
The police have a strong background in dog training and the defense has expertise in explosives.
Customs and other authorities decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Bay include the customs authorities' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from 10 puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog for the airport include the ability to scratch and hunt, and the tranquility of the dog as it deals with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Sun's house, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but he is also a family member.
Nothing goes home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Heila's got a lot of fine orders coming from the coal mines.
The nightly news cameraman loses the camera's mic protection to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like protection immediately on the "snap" command.
A tough competition from a working dog
Heila's elementary school graduation is next year.
The next level of tests will be held in October to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in Helsinki Beach in the second half of next year if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, travelers cannot come to the beach to pet a dog in a workrobe, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of a working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they are retired and in the care of their owners.
Workdays may be long, ranging from eight to 10 hours, but active work hours last only from 10 minutes to a few hours.
There's a lot of competition in the city for working dogs.
Heila's employed about 20 to 30 customs officials.
I'm lucky Suntie didn't have a working dog before, but she has years of experience working with dogs and supervising customs.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal . The nation gets a day off .
The country's under a million residents in the Olympic Rugby League are so highly regarded that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day of freedom is the day after the team returns home.
The hero team is also allowed to hold parties in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, I heard them cheer", Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
In Rio , a Finnish elevator turned after a violent performance .
Weightlifter Milko Tokola made his last attempt after a hard-fought 175kg fight.
The stool has a special and life-threatening trait to lift.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has been paralyzed many times.
No one's ever been able to tell me why.
Tokola was found in Rio with a weight of 175 kg and a weight of 145 kg.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his weight back to 175 pounds, just like the other guy.
On the third attempt, the weight increased with a furious scream.
The body trembled under the weight until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish elevator's joy was accompanied by the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired Estonian striker Prosa - Vikkausliga - Evening News
The Rovaniemi Football Club, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the remainder of the season.
We're looking for a top player with a lot of talent and a small chance to make it to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We've been through a bunch of 50 players from around the world with over a dozen player agents.
Prosa has gradually emerged as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Floral, California, where he has scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to join RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjo, where the Rovaniemians will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
The RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Cook, the last season's painter, moved to Australia.
The modern family star is back in the spotlight: teenage shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as Alex Dunphy in the modern family comedy series, is once again being disgraced by a menacing body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini-horses that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only exposed the actor's feet, but also this back.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making a significant change in style and behavior.
The star has posed for her social media posts in very few clothes and taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very small robes.
Winter, on the brink of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life, and he grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he looks on the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was just 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his altered image.
It's not hard to imagine where he will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard", says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
No matter what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a bright young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland, attracting tourists with a flashlight: in autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to encourage Japanese people to start their return trips from the start, Visit Finland said in a statement.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese resorts.
The winds are the main cards of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
The demand for return trips in Lapland in the winter is high, but we are now trying to increase sales of the autumn trips.
Few people know that the revontulism season begins in early autumn and continues into late spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the rays of light, making the view twice as random, says Anne Lind, vice-president of marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's revamped campaign is focused on wealthy, urban Japanese women aged 25-35 who dream of travel and new experiences.
They're already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Among other things, tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising.
A survey by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turin and Tokyo showed that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more unique sights than Finland, and Lind believes that this reventole has enormous potential.
The number of overnight stays for Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as many nights as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, having spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain will be content with the rugby silver as the FIDE championship course leads to gold
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament failed Fidji's final challenge in the final on Thursday night, when the team suffered a 43-7 defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held the championship course in handball, archery, wrestling, track and field and silk, winning gold in their first Olympic medal.
The loss brought a reasonable consolation for the silver medal - Britain's third-place finish - and they were proud of their hard work in the opening round of the Olympic rugby competition, which they won over New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier that day, I was playing in the semi-final. A hard 7-5 win over South Africa could have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won the top 15 teams in this condition.
Great Britain may be relieved, but it is probably not, that at least one Briton will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow:
The journey to Great Britain has been quite long.
Eight years ago, Ryan coached them, they lost every game in the Adelaide Tournament.
They only lost one here.
This back pain is painful, but the development is startling.
Fidi was a great start to resisting British repression for the sake of fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau sank into the goal area at the corner.
With the clock ticking, Jerry Tuwa's second touchdown on the right field led to a goal.
12-0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tack stopped the male mountain lion, Leone Nakarawa, from making the third painting, but it was a slow one for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Bloemalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain were down 17-0 on the grid.
Nakarawa scored again from the start, and the clock was still more than a minute away from the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouvou jumped through the loose obstacles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score.
After the kick, the situation was 29-0 when we went to rest.
It looked as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's the way it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes during the break, which kept Fid's dam shut for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton scored a touchdown for Great Britain in the left corner and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's cheerful approach.
The last minute low-level winner's goal was to have a crust on Fidi's cake that didn't need crust.
The Phillies were angry, the Fidelis embraced, and Britain fell to the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Britain had won the South African hard-fought semi-final, where both scored one goal - the British goal kick was the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a stunning footwork and scored below the goal-stones in the second half.
A great late blowout from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of England's 15-a-side rugby team, secured the win and ultimately the silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer has led to a decisive victory for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
There will be no more emotionally charged gold in these games, and it certainly means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard-hitting turns toward the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa to be of deeper meaning.
Even though they agreed, there were three voices on board, and coach Robin Williams's voice was present as the two men clashed for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles event, the first women in British sports history to achieve such a feat.
Their rule was perfect, and this was their 39th unbeaten performance, which is also a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface with a tight grip, does not fully reflect the nature of the win.
And behind every salt school is a group of helpful handlers who gradually promote the things that matter, and no handlers were as important as the coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would survive to this day.
Like he said, it was a mess.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky to have her treatment started in early 2014 off-season, causing as little interference as possible - if that term can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Playing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first couple of thoughts came to Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a veteran captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said: "I've been in a mood this week, which may be a bit overreacting, but this means so much to me.
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I, and Robin too, have worked.
The three years we've spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he deserves a lot of credit. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
A couple set a penalty rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 yards, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen screamed, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We got off to a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we just wanted to fight well and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover's getting married next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on me.
After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic winner.
It was so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better, he said.
Iceland replaces the government that was robbed by the Panama floods
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which is being called for by protesters who have been angry at the Panama floods since spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed the tax evasion of many Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it wasn't enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now October 29.
Analysts say it's difficult to predict how much the nation's latest anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of those in power was evident, and a non-political candidate, Gudni Johannesson, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS.
The Republican presidential candidate of the United States, Donald Trump, has withdrawn his latest speeches of terror.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the organization's creation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
As commander-in-chief of the military, you should never let anyone down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favorite burkini swimsuit for swimming, reports the Guardian, for example.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that swimming and swimming are forbidden for anyone who does not wear a well-mannered and secular swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimming pools that exaggerate religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, a man linked to two extremist groups linked to the Islamic State attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu area 's swimming water has exceeded the seawater level in the blue-green lagoon of Lake Laukösö
Water samples taken from official swimming pools in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the beach of Lake Pigeon has been detected with a bluish-black spark.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Environment Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentrations of E. coli and enteric bacteria from the intestinal compartments of all bathing waters except the coast of the Mediterranean Sea were below the measures provided for in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E. coli and enterocoke levels in the waters of the Marine Basin were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-black deposits observed on the shores of Lake Baikonur do not yet render the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-black deposition, which will result in blue-green deposits of water on the surface.
Environmental action is monitoring the situation with a tight inspection.
If the bluetongue becomes bluetongue, the swimming pool reporting table shall also be provided separately.
Check the results of the swimming water samples here.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 laying down the rules on the application of this Regulation.
The reduction in forest donations is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The income tax law proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the generational tax on the forestry sector.
The Ministry of Finance has proposed that forest yield reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest areas, to rejuvenate the ageing population of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote an entrepreneurial forestry sector.
The forest owner would deduct the net capital income of the forestry sector.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote generational forestry changes is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural Producers (CFA).
However, the applicant finds the tax reform proposal to be a criticism.
The forest grant reduction shall be undertaken on the net capital income of the forest owner.
That is the capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
MTK and Hakkaraisen consider that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the profits of the sale of wood.
The presentation of the VM is based on the premise that the reduction in the net forest income prevents the loss of forest income which would be deducted in other taxation.
A person like that would get a tax break even if they didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is a little complicated.
The average forest owner can't see it, says the Hacker.
He also said that the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax reduction on the value of forest production is EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn too high in the mind of the Hacker.
In this way, he said, it would remove 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction zone.
He says the model would have an impact on about 10 percent of forest ownership.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the space.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest yields has been taken away for decades, according to Hakkaraisen.
The reason for this is the ageing of the forestry sector.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful raccoon surprised the drivers in the Himalayas . Two cars collided in a lane .
There was a special afternoons on the Himanga River on Friday morning.
According to the rescue service, two cars running in a row crashed into the lane, then the rear-end collision hit the front-end.
According to the fire chief of the day, Harry Pyhti, the cause of the explosion was a suspected violent gunshot wound.
In the rear of the car were two people, both of whom were being transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more information about their injuries.
The driver of the car in front of us was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from the Himalayas a few kilometers to the Fish River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers at the University of Turin can help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings of the research team of Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published in the highly regarded journal Nature Communications on August 4.
The prosecution is still investigating the murder of Muhosh's family.
The court continues to hear the family murder of the two convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family in Muhoks.
One received eight years and four months, including a young manslaughter and a brutal robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of grossly endangering traffic safety as a young person and of driving a motor vehicle as a young person.
The appeals court's ruling was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harshest sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding a lighter sentence for a man convicted of murder as a young person and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were on time in full understanding.
The appeals court said the 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as the head of the school's child protection unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder allegedly attacked a driver sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had escaped and had entered the young man's room, when another young man struck him with a blowtorch.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the psychological investigation, both of the convicts were at the time of the crime in full understanding.
The court found that the young men had been planning to flee the family home since at least the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, only reproducing at 156.
The world's longest living spine is a confirmed ice shark, says a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The fact that the ice is growing only one centimeter a year adds to the life of the ice.
Only one species of shrimp is known to live longer than the ice shark.
The researchers were able to determine the age by radioactivity.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residue.
They were the basis for the scientists to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, but a throw in one direction or another could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as the economic wisdom of the world - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's corporate tax reform was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with the most profitable tax breaks.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
If we didn't, we'd have a really big sum of money, $1 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after Trump's 33 percent cut.
We'd give up the inheritance tax altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards set by the Hellenic authorities must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform is going to have to be reviewed.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
It would be a 45 percent tax on imports from China and a 35 percent tax on imports from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanity, not globalization, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
American cars will be driving on the streets, American planes will be connecting cities, American ships will be guarding the seas, American steel will be raising new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his usual ways, Trump faithfully reads the speech written by his aides, despite 14 interruptions by well-organized protests.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own program early Friday, Finnish time.
The Wave of Attacks on the Past - People's News
The sea is waving fatefully, but a real wave of attack is hitting the streets of Madrid... and the reckoning with the past can begin.
In short, that's the heart of Pedro Almodóvar's story of novelty.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, The Traveling Pants (2013), was a short-lived and semi-running satirical comedy, preceded by Iho in which I live (2011), the highlights of the Spanish actress' career.
Equally, Julieta (2016) is somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventional inner drama of love, human relationships, and family, centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and can be seen from far behind.
Life seems to be a pattern for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left wondering until the end of the movie.
In the form of a long letter, Juliet recounted the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
He starts from before the birth of his daughter, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
In the second female role, Julieta is portrayed by Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher from the TV series The Time Between the Ommelt (2013-2014).
Juliet's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a treat, but I would say quite a bit, literally, by repeating the process.
For the Almodóvar films, often with such a distinctive flair for humor, there's always a fair distance to Juliet.
It's a solidly staged, well-controlled, place-by-place movie with good music and a very sad film with elements of elegance.
Instead, the Spanish director has a visual richness of colour that starts to strike a little bit of a silent eye as a pure fashion piece rather than a dramatic exercise in effect.
The characters in the film are suffering from illness, death, or some other sudden loss, but the surface remains the same.
This is particularly true of the costume: in the case of the name person, the accommodation varies from scene to scene, and the same applies to the apparent replacements.
Almodóvar is very precise in these matters, but the main thing, the adjustments to each scene, are not particularly improved.
Mechanically, when it's repeated, the effect is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three novels by Alice Munro, a Canadian who won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.
The novels have been published in the book The Carnival: Stories.
Almodóvar has contributed to dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filmmaking.
The subject matter would have been emotionally unparalleled in the drama, as big as the subject matter of the film, especially the sheer guilt.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The main cast includes Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie's opening night is Aug. 12.
The government is trying to win the election.
The ministers are not making any new cuts, they are hooking up so that the fundamentalists do not collapse completely.
But the surgery, which is scheduled for spring, is done at the grocery store.
There's no more surgery.
The four billion dollars already decided on are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Co) assure under the budgetary procedure.
It is true that there are no new operations in the VM's presentation, since the social security operations were decided on as early as the spring.
The reduction in the child benefit, the social pension, the basic unemployment insurance and almost all other social pension indexes will be 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment insurance scheme will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The training operations are continuing.
The royal ghosts
Why are ministers so emphatic about not having new surgeries?
Because next year is an election year.
The royal election is in April and they're the most important heat meter of the election season, not the gallops.
It has been seen before that the result of municipal elections in different directions by the governing parties is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the ruling party expects fundamentalists to lose a crumb, despite its previous election result being unpopular at 12.3 percent compared to parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the fundamentalists received 752 new deputies, many of whom will be paid next spring for their influence in the right-wing government.
The life cycle of the government of three or so major parties depends on the survival of the fundamentalists.
It has not lasted long, but more than half of the voters have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's position have also emerged.
The rhetoric of no new cuts is to overshadow the fact that they will be done vigorously next year and to try to soften the blow to the fundamentalists.
Major surgeries in 2018?
In a year, things are probably going to be different if the Sibylla government is still standing.
The government has set a target of debt consolidation for this election period, but the budget proposal for Petteri Orpo will take into account EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the election period and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt seems neither to have been borrowed nor even to have slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new, even tougher cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget lines.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the spring, what comes next will be voted on in parliamentary elections.
I don 't think these things have made you go into debt .
It is clear that the current measures have not been able to create a positive mood.
The Commission's proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States are also in line with the Commission's proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States.
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be universally based, meaning that there is no attraction from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the collapse in 2008, except during the period of the recovery policy initiated in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% over the decade, increasing from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor in the form of a market economy investor.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt collection of the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment is around EUR 6 billion, which is almost entirely covered by new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the assembly and the fundamentalists of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of work to the honorees
Three out of four believe that the responsibility of the municipality is to provide day care, youth work and exercise, according to a study by the KAKS Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
The vast majority of the population also has responsibility for libraries, culture, public universities, building control, secondary education and waste management.
The responsibility of the country is to be more clearly defined by the provinces, specialised healthcare, vocational education, higher vocational education and training and the institutional care of the disabled.
No tasks in the responsibility of the municipality for the administration of public order are to be transferred to the State.
A juvenile drunk driver ran a chase to escape police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from the state of Jönsü ran away from a police party on the island of Ilomantsi on Friday night at 1:30 p.m.
The police tried to stop a motorcycle that was driving without lights, but the young man ran off to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The journey continued to the Sonkajan Beach, from which it continued to Sorronahonti and to a smaller forest road where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Soon afterward, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman caught up with the fugitive.
The ventilation test on the driver showed a 0.75 per milliliter.
He also did not have a driving license that would have entitled him to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious road safety threat.
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch .
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch on the Knees River on the Cavinti River Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had been driven to the left in a corner and out of the road and fell into a side lane.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver from the crashed truck through the door above the left, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The car owner was responsible for lifting the vehicle.
A truck that fell down the road was spilled with hydraulic oil that the rescue service sucked into the mud.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Air River.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the Air River Valley in South Pond.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 5'8" tall, hairy and well-groomed with white hair that extends below the cheek.
For information and clues on missing movements, please call the Northern Ireland Situation Centre's reference number 0295440513.
The materials of the major accident in the air. Watch the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest.
The storming of the Parafest festival tents caused extensive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, said the festival will be financially viable and could be held next year.
The last performance of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, was on the final stage of the competition on Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre beginning at 1 p.m.
The Art Center of Ahos has a Parafest show at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
The program is being organized as planned.
The fall flow is generated in a cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling airflow.
Changes in the water's shape in the cloud bind the heat, and as a result, the descending air cools and accelerates its velocity toward the ground.
The Meteorological Institute reports that there are several summer floods in Finland.
It's hard to predict the path of the seizure.
The storm surge struck the backyard of the Joseon Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, he slightly injured four people.
One child was in the group and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Londoners are getting older because of air pollution
A study has shown that the skin of Londoners ages faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The Evening Standard reports that the British study was conducted.
British skin care company Caci analyzed the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin in London without any.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of their peers in rural areas.
The tiny particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses, killing nearly 9,500 Londoners each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass through the most loading layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk to work near busy streets.
For example, people in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes were cheating .
The man had moved stones in his yard by tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor hit the man.
The man did not fall, but the tractor pushed him so far that he was taken to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor couldn't take the wave any longer because it hit the rocks in front of it.

Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Cup of salibandy since 2003.
The sixth race is now underway in Tampere, and only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American races.
I was working at the market and playing with the women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was setting up a national salib band.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near the town of Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I first came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as salibandy at the SM level.
They were playing basketball in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later played ice hockey in the SM series with the Jumppa.
Jumppanen played for the university in the salibandys SM series in the 1991-92 season, and spent the next three seasons in Josbas.
Along with playing, he trained the A's for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked at silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-liiga through 10 games, totaling 169 matches, 51 + 34 = 85.
The last SM period is 2001-2002.
The Pussycat and the Tattoo Curve were named to the national team .
Perttu Puska, who was raised by the Joseba family of the Salisbury family in the River Estuary, and Tatu Väänänen, who is from the Estuary, were selected for the Finnish national team to play in the Czech Brno EFT on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25, has played in the Helsinki Erak before the six-man country match, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, has recovered from a hip injury and is a regular member of the national team with 117 international appearances.
The national team also includes the Seinäjoen Pelivelli competitor Mika Kohonen, who was last seen wearing a Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is the Count Count Count Petri Kettunen.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hasun 's circle closes in Kouvola .
Essi Hasu is retiring from beach volleyball at least temporarily after the season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be decided at the Kouvola Sportspark this weekend.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both the adult and youth competitions.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Air Ballers and the Finnish Air Ballers' Association, the six best pairs from each series will be selected for the SM final tournament.
The local colour is represented by Essi Hasu, a member of Elimäen NMKY, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball team for several years.
Now based in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see it this weekend.
I'm sure the Pesis Stadium is going to be a great arena.
I haven't played in the big leagues in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu's mood.
The Kouvola neighborhood lit up Hasu's sparkle for sport and gave good dinners for a great pastime.
I've got a lot of memories of my childhood.
I started flying at age 9 with the E-girls of the Elements NMKY.
The main thing is a big game shirt, knee pads with a curved ankle, and a lot of high-pitched aces and choreography after the score, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team's shared spirit created an environment that was comfortable to play in.
All the families were very active. Our team-mate's father trained us, and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
As a junior, Hassou's beach volleyball was a natural legally binding weight for the ball.
The pool on the curb has been playing drums since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to the Junior Junior Junior Tournament myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now that dream comes true, Hasu plays the weekend with the youngest kid, Anniina Parki, in the SM finals.
The aim of the second-ranked pair in the tournament, after Rich Lehtosen and Taru Lahda, is clear.
We have a medal as a realistic goal.
We still lack the SM gold in the prize box, the Hasu throws it mysteriously.
The weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last audience Hasou knows.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in the civil war.
Yeah, well, my international career is over after the Kissing Ball.
Otherwise, the toenails will be nailed, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A storm surge knocked down tents at the disabled event in Joensu, a major accident was nearby.
The storm has knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Johannesburg.
According to the newspaper Karjalaisen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to the cattle, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5:00.
Markus Viitaniemi, a firefighter who interviewed Karjalain, told the newspaper that the situation was a catastrophe.
The paper says the outcome of the incident is in doubt.

Solomon's Ark Bravely Left as a Farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, working hard and being diligent.
A young farmer, 25-year-old Solomon Koli, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Koli started about two years ago with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their home business.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant borrowing and increasing the supply so that bread could be made available to farmers.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always loved to hang out on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard pond, and at first the bank wasn't too excited about it.
However, I myself took a very courageous part in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken the initiative if he had not believed in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out for the better.
The goal of Salomon Kol, a carnivore, is to invest in even larger carnivores.
The work has paid off, as Solomon's Colli has been selected among the top ten in the Contest for Young Food Producers for the Future of Rural Life magazine.
He's currently competing for a potential win.
He can vote on the paper's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number in years (after June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation rate, measured by the cost of living index, was -0,8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
At the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0,2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods prices were observed in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3%), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), mixed goods and services (0,3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained the same as the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
SnapChat's anime plant is rated as an Asian catfish
Snapchat says the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to modify their reality and play with their identities in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into an anise, a dog, or a character that would fit into a painting by Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are simple, facial-curving tools that produce over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the delusional steps will quickly end up in public records.
SnapChat's lenses have been criticized in the past for allegations that the app promotes blackface or favours bleaching as a beauty target.
So when Snapchat advertised this week for some users a lens that gave them dirty eyes, dirty teeth and dirty cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people -- keltana or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies could be a sign of a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, and a day later Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company explained that the lens was intended to honor anime characters, not Asian cartoon characters.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly disapproved of the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable.
He added that it was difficult to argue against the comparison of the rough Asian characteristics and the efficiency of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow channel, but a yellow channel, directed to extreme low-frequency.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's going beyond these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry around.
And Snapchat's huge, racially diverse audience of young people with parents can mean that they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, it's much harder for these guys to stay out of the way.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a letter to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed race-related disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay policies.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat).
Even though they do not have a wide range of skin colour representation on their staff, which enables them to make decisions like this, said Zhu, a Chinese-American,or they have representatives of different skin colours at work but they are not in a position where they feel safe or can speak up.
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely ignored.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, stating its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss racial discrimination on its staff, but a spokesman said the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and advance internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu himself said he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not okay".
A congressional panel found that military officials were falsifying intelligence from ISIS.
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said that the authorities had modified intelligence reports from the U.S. military's war zone headquarters to present a more optimistic view of the war on ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground justified.
The report, prepared by the House Republican Committee on Defense, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Committee, found widespread discontent among intelligence analysts at the White House, who said the officials were undermining their assessment of the U.S. effort to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Warfare Area in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The intelligence reports approved by the top Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable... our fighters in war suffer when poor analysis is presented to high-level decision-makers", Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, said.
The failures of Centcom's leadership reach the very top of the organization.
The decennial report details the ongoing problems in the description and analysis of the US's efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that high-level administration officials in the Obama administration ordered the reports to be tampered with, it portrays analysts as feeling that Centcom executives would have put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress from the headquarters were significantly more positive than the events themselves, the report said.
The Commission has therefore considered that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that would be compatible with the internal market.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear", said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
In mid-2014, the top intelligence officials at the US military's war zone headquarters manipulated intelligence output from the headquarters to reduce the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will follow up on more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
The DOD's inspector general has launched an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released their own findings, which were consistent with the final conclusions of some Republican groups.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a needlessly isolated process for intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's lead Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "continued to delay the publication of intelligence results", "decreased the mood among analysts and left insufficient room for divergent views".
Mr Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to agree their conclusions to a policy statement.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's chief inspector general had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Captain Patrick Evans, the Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.
The investigation has other implications than the success of US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's allegations questioned how much President Obama can trust the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIL intelligence reflects a controversy over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article that said that despite objections from several analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported a small force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key player in the insurgency over the Islamic State's intelligence.
According to authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that despite the contrary public statements, the airstrikes against refineries run by the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The then Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the women's field hockey tournament for the fourth time in a row by holding a mid-term interview with Britain .
The day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday in a 3-0 win over the Americans over India.
Five in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure he had done the same before.
"I have no idea", he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his paintings.
But he knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics, and they share the top spot with Britain, which was still undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will decide who comes first and who comes second in their group of six teams.
The first placed team will avoid the strong Dutchman, the leader of the second group, a little longer in the quarterfinals.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans have been raising the bar with their surprising success here, four years after they were left in the bottom 12 at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and first took up field hockey at age 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) joining the field at age 16, when he became the youngest player ever to do so.
She was not in the 2008 Olympics because she did not make her final roster.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, spiritual change, physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the same workload in London as we do now.
We've made a complete change.
On Thursday night, Bam began the first half of the painting with a ribbon cutting near the painting.
India had come into play with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took control.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then turned the center and kicked the ball into the goal to lead the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the fourth quarter.
This zero-game was the first tournament for U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of his first three wins.
He's on the move.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position now", Parnham said, "but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game".
The peace of Trampoline in the midst of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be ongoing and inevitable, a message of fierce competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic Games themselves are a flaming hostel, cared for from archer to swimmer to powerlifter to triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on the television, read the newspaper, or listen to a conversation in a coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympic heartbreaker and future Olympic star with a smile on his face, could well be one of the most recognizable names in the world that is being featured in prime time and supported by sponsorship deals and good-natured TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympics don't illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, in some shadows, are the types not generally accepted: air gun, arrow gun, volleyball, taekwondo.
We always have a breastfeed, long as it lives.
But if I can make a moderate number of my specials, I'd like to draw attention to the restrained attractiveness of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, its presence has received so little attention over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian men usually share medals, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals in London.
However, there is a certain underdog appeal to trampoline, partly because it sounds more appropriate to an uncivilized ear than it does to an Olympic clown school.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert. I'm just a fan of flightlessness.
The species has possibilities for amusement, as seen in the color of the endless jumping of cartoons, but it also has the complexity of exercise and swimming, two species that are essentially combined.
The word trampoliini comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning a trampoline.
To achieve the championship, the giant trampoline will jump to nearly 30 feet in height, and they will have to perform a series of spectacular moves (turns, turns, and volts) before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
32 athletes from 17 countries compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight forward.
Metal hopes must go further, faster, up and over... sometimes to the goal, sometimes backwards around the field.
They're not just chasing the finish line or the opening credits, but also, in television news, another ironic frontier: the world record or the Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it can even bring tears to the viewer.
But that's also why watching the games can be a little tiring.
The trampoline is offering a resting place.
The trampoline is heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, acting like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
This, of course, is not without competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no furious rush to the end, no leaps to the distance, just a dreamlike, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as you can get to the Olympics.
The women's race and the final will be held on Friday afternoon with the broadcast starting at 1 p.m. (ET), with the men's race also on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon programming beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic smoke, they provide a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be watched and objectified (as U.S. men's gymnastics officials suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new fanbase to mourn.
A generation of people are showing their affection for Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police fired and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage, recorded during protests, believed to be late last year or early this year, shows security officials beating young people with their hands as they were forced to stand against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future", said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate its stability.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has been greatly improved, and the capital Addis Ababa is even home to a new working-class train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, and human rights organizations have consistently spoken of government oppression, limited opposition, and effective suppression of dissent.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the wilderness.
But this could be changing.
 If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, this is what will happen, said Seyoum Teshome, a university professor in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is showing off.
One generation is showing their mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the repression of the ruling coalition.
After the much-criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now holds all seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, a battle that took hundreds of lives along this tense and contentious border in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of the slavery and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why bitter feelings are now exploding after years of being frozen under the surface.
The first seems to be a seemingly innocuous one: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, with cheaper smartphones becoming more common and Internet access improving.
Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people could still communicate through the network's hidden location servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, Oromos and Amhara, are better able to get along.
Oromos and Amhara are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharians, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian upper class, prospered in politics and business by taking advantage of the Oromo people, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is about to change, too.
"We are on the way to organizing under one umbrella", said Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharians and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the tiger people, who comprise about six percent of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using secret envoys to harmlessly harm opponents.
"Current governance has no such basic intuition", said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' shoes.
Unlike Meles, who was from the northern Ethiopian tiger region, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the tiger-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a state of decadence was in 2005, when thousands expressed their dismay at elections that analysts said seemed to be first plundered and then plundered by the government.
In the ensuing violence, many protesters died, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure design, such as a new workflow, and for their remarkable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the contempt for the Ethiopian government from within the country.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tiger anger is becoming more and more prevalent on social media.
Analysts say the protests will put the United States and other Western allies in a dirty position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for air traffic controllers in neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed down this base.
While Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the volatile region to collapse.
This, Abdi said, is a real balance.
Donald Trump explains his claim to the Obama-based ISIS as "sarcastic"
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the controversy surrounding his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn't serious when he repeatedly claimed this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The investigation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have been pinned down to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position to explain remarks that he may not mean.
After a hint made at a campaign rally on Wednesday, Trump made the same increasingly enthusiastic claim in Thursday's interviews, where he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The release was a complete reversal of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump deflect his comment by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to heart.
The latest criticism storm comes at a time when Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign amid falling poll results.
Trump and Clinton were fighting in a talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
On Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcastic defense before.
In late July, after he faced widespread criticism apparently for suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying, 'Of course I am sarcastic'.
The approach allows Trump to go to the margins of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans, looks at how they work, and then explains them in one direction or another depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart about his statements and knows they're vague enough to be filtered through a variety of different lenses.
Instead of easing his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been more stubborn in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Trump is following Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally avoids apologizing for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misinterpreting his sense of humor.
As he faces increasing scrutiny in the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, struggled to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real, political comments", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little bit unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened, because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's Pennsylvania meeting, Trump continued his Twitter attack on the news media, which flouted every word he said and were biased against him.
He mocked the nasty, pathetic TV experts who tried to get him out, saying they couldn't!
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuse as new evidence that he's unfit to be president.
The cafe that was closed back in Greenpoint .
The Verb Cafe was a small, cash-only place in Williamsburg, with no wireless network, but one that served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the Bedford Avenue streetfront was too expensive for him.
The company that replaced Verbe in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
Local residents mourned it as the latest loss to a middle-class city undergoing renovation.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crumbling and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
Resurrected Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from where it was originally located.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same, and there's the same unfinished spirit.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001, and he was there until the end.
When a client offered to finance him in his new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things going.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used the old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes gourmet egg and cheese buns, and covers include capricorns and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the balls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In the last nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old carrier customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many of our former clients", he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he was walking to the coffee shop.
He says after Verbin closed up, he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture", he said.
Now he's back for coffee, although that day he ordered a chai mixed instead of his regular ice cream, one of the new additions.
Another longtime client, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal guest at Verb since 2003.
He used to go there before he worked and he always made the same order.
"Every day at fifteen or seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel sandwiches", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not angry at a soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to produce a special coffee bar for Verbille, which would be made from frozen coffee.
"I think we can still hold on to the offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish people of Greenpoint have also embraced coffee.
One of these new customers turned the restaurant into a Polish one, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it on display somewhere soon to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
There are other advantages to the new location.
A local beekeeper wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
It's possible the cafe could expand into the building next door.
For many customers, it's enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a carrier and said he was uncomfortable when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I've been wanting to smell it", she said.
A Square Meal: a paralyzing meal of the sheep's age
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to have lunch in his office.
As a tender affection, President Roosevelt enjoyed sophisticated Fifth Avenue food, such as the frog-bottle steak and the Maryland pickle steak.
On that day, his diet was more modest: eggs in a tomato basket, potatoes, and a dessert of leafy fruit.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering", said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told of life in the Lower East Side warehouse through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will publish Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In a show of their own culinary solidarity, they meet the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpretentious lunch bar in Flatiron that has been in operation since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato juice and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating sheep.
"The grievances were very popular", Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut butter, a liver butter, a peppermint.
They were made of a raw material and some cheap ingredient to supplement the actual raw material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they'll make up your dinner.
Coe was mocking.
"It must have felt like a lead-in-the-belly", he said.
In the years before the Black Era, American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eat-in-a-lot-as-a-part-shop.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh cakes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. The book A Square Meal chronicles how the nation suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally troubling was the new, affordable diet: Mystery foods such as snacks and boxes became staples, and the box was a "powerful way to use food sources", Ziegelman said, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a layer of cream bowl.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been the center of American cuisine for years, became a sparingly prescribed luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when calories and nutrients were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In his research, Ziegelman also prepared a food of the era for a book of recipes, in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table, Coe said.
Ziegelma's point: "It was unreal".
Peanut butter is not a good choice for fried onions.
This was typical of many home recipes.
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Housing Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's diet more than ever before or since.
Recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to start as 'budgeters' and to meet the challenge of turning spaghetti and carrots into delicious servings.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic meals.
The reports of government reactions to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude to let me eat cake, are particularly tasty.
While he publicly praised his childhood simple Iowa food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with a throat cactus", Coe said.
He was eating a half-golded dining room with a tuxedo on.
He was so out of touch.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his own belly.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that served not only the most disgusting food in Washington, but also the most miserably cooked.
Many of the ancient methods of eating were abandoned as soon as the land was restored.
As a legacy, our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting his food", Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick".
There was a wind-hat incident.
After the plates were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: a peanut butter dish that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
It's called a feathered recipe, Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give the modest recipes a name that looked like one.
The after-dinner was no cream sauce, just feathers, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all unwillingly dipped their spoons in a sticky, brown list.
And, surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe was a little bit of a bitch.
He heard a positive budgetary comment and told his wife that the "smartly mocked German nuts" could help.
Gilead is being paid for its attorney fees in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck.
A United States District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the costs of its legal proceedings in the Hepatitis C case against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released from $200 million in fines for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's success drugs, Swaldi and Harvon, following a U.S. judge's finding of Merck's misuse of false oaths and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to relief from compensation for the objection to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can significantly cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The trial continues until 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against one another over the ownership of a laboratory work based on the pharmaceutical substance sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say they have taken over Manbij, an Islamic State-controlled city.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern Turkish border town of Manbij after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had freed more than 2,000 civilian prisoners held captive by the militants, Sharfan Darwish SDF's allied force, the Manbij military council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it", he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential nominee and his wife's income for that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State reported receiving 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, have issued 10 years of tax returns.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to assess the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting a benchmark for financial transparency, Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and revoking his previous promises to release his tax returns.
The way it is, the US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn't require them to.
New York businessman Trump's lawyers have appealed to the IRS for a review of the tax filings for refusal to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn", said Ian Sams, Clinton's campaign aide, on Twitter, when he posted a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has been caught up in the problem in a web video published on Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he brought up the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: publish his tax return, he told the public.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday borrowed numerous tax attorneys and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named by billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, who owns the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also running a tax audit, and that Trump isn't afraid of the IRS, he's afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been issuing tax returns up to 2007.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission's comments on the proposed measures are not justified by the fact that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a State aid measure.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilean elephant condoms and lightning bolsters Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human habitations - throwing animals away with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective, and the idea, developed several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation in association with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has been enhanced by training volunteers in rural areas in northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent four-step approach to protecting homes and cattle without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to protecting these animals.
"Since we developed... tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, where we are now much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", said Damian Bell, HoneyGuide's CEO.
The first two steps involve pointing to an intruding elephant with a flashlight and ringing a trumpet.
If it doesn't stop the animal, it's called a chilip cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and a lightning rod, after which the condom is wrapped so that only the ignition line is visible.
When you light a condom, it bursts into flames and sprays chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last means is a trigger that blows a Roman candle into the air, and the revelry produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli route number at Arab request
A French-Jewish filmmaker was shocked when a media storm broke out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli route number, according to the employee, because of the "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the documentary Shoah about the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German publication FAZ.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to locate a hotel in Israel from a list of countries offering a destination.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be contacted directly from a hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel will be removed and erased?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received there shocked him.
The hotel's receptionist said that this was a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels.
The reason behind the decision caused the filmmaker even more shock.
Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding that the Israeli route number be removed, according to the employee, according to Lanzmann.
German ambassador to Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great injustice", reports Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That's a great injustice in itself.
But even more shameful is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We're waiting for the hotel to make the right decisions, the official said.
The incident generated quite a backlash online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave way" to the claimed demands of Arab customers.

The hotel itself quickly denied all the charges, calling the incident "unnoticed" and apologizing to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
A clear order to exclude Israel from the list of emergency measures was never issued, a representative from Kempinski reportedly said, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the route number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber products against brazilian students who were willing to take part in the protest.
On Thursday, students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as students gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber products against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to disrupt the student body, which led to the police using rubber products and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the protest to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals of São Paulo Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some demonstrators were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters came together to support the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, who was detained by the country's Senate.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran rises abruptly by 71%.
Since the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9% compared to the previous year, said Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue to link their existing companies to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Naturally, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade, Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission also noted that the volume of imports from the PRC was not significantly higher than the volume of imports from the PRC.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose 91.5 percent to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade growth was achieved by the supply of machines, vehicles and weapons, the Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia for the first time.
It should be safe to say that last year's record for Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken, he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition, he said.
Scottium Skinner jumped on the targets while the British captured the cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner paid tribute to the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night as the three-man Great Britain team defended their 2012 championship in London.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish counterpart Sir Chris Roy rose to prominence, a legend that was proud of the young man when he scored the winning goal in the pre-season against New Zealand.
Britain won the shock four years ago, as Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick by placing modestly sixth in the March track at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since retired from racing.
The problem between the Beijing Games and the London Games was replacing Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
The end of the treatment also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches for his Scottish potential, which is now recognised.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoye four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record in the time trial, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British Triple won the gold medal in the double.
Hindes was a complete behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead, and Skinner held on.
The change in strategy was a big part of the change in form, and that included driving Hindes a bigger turn to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his role as a BBC expert, attracting the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped into the award category.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "The competition is flattering.
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the world championship.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning the 2012 London Grand Prix alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling off the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew his comments and no complaints have been made by his British competitors.
This time, with a victory that was overwhelming, there was no problem.
Hindes said, "It felt like I was in London, with so many British flags on the pedestrian.
We've been in contact as a team for the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten cycling events in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the progress of the last five months, we're going to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's fitness, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoye's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals at one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (probably a holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have won a total of six gold medals and one silver.
It'd be the same as Howie.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one right now.
Team competition is always the best.
We'll win it with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight".
This was the only medal match of the day, but Britain had more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest men in the four-horse, four-kilometer team time trial.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 gold medal winner in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of competition, with Wiggins certainly the centre of attention.
He had a fight with the judges yesterday before the deadline when the officials called him to the length measurement.
In the same women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of the Milwaukee, advanced in a world record time of 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and win the whole set of medals.
After a very exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered before the Rio Games.
There has been drama, the least of which has been the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the race for celebrities like Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night of racing at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's now legendary reputation of peaking at the perfect moment could once again be right.
The future of Portland's oil spill is in question because of the cancellation of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's aluminum factory in Victoria, as well as hundreds of jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the plant discloses that one of the plant's owners is finalizing a distribution agreement, so it is expected that all distribution agreements will be terminated.
The action follows the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the support required to keep the plant in operation.
The 20-year period of support ends in November.
Even 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
Even 2,000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of the closure.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melting process uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Angles power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland is losing money and is under lockdown.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the plant's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium-fired power plant at Loy Yang An in the Latrobe Valley, said it was also waiting for the three other owners to finalize their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, while the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical demand for non-melting electricity will continue, it said.
The AGL considers that the agreements are the so-called 'protection agreements' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month grace period and therefore effectively expire in 2017.
Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to be profitable in the financial year 2017, the electricity company said.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the electricity sector.
AGL said it had already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in the forecast for completion.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the smelter running or secure the undried electricity supply.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been wary of the potential closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomagon plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, this would be a significant reduction in market demand.
He said that this would not be a good thing for us as electricity producers.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, fourth daughter of the Jenner clan, is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue America.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has been a model for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday via her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The release was followed by a one-of-a-kind (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the troubled Rob and Caitlyn, and including everyone's favorite entertainer, Keeping Up with the Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but ended up in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliché plotline for almost every birthday episode of a children's television series (Seacrest probably thought we'd forget you by the credibility of the spoiled puppy), but Kris had to get other daughters to take advantage of this publicity.
That's because we've definitely moved into a new Kardashian era with Vogue's place in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been the first to get Vogue's coverage (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling print of the year.
Its thickness resembles a coffee table book more than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page guidebook were advertising content).
The publication of this article is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, the magazine's images have leaked before being officially released.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more celebrity covers acting as models than celebrity covers.
Oscar-winning and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's funeral.
But if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "success model" of his generation, falls into that category first, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or the young people of today who can make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all that).
They are, by all accounts, talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's national model Beyoncé has had one of the strongest years of her career, with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's place in the world of fashion will always be a mess.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the whores of the moment.
This feeling came up again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But it's irrelevant to be running around in dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a role model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you some Estee Lauder makeup.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their apps, backed up by their paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids, she's a reality TV star.
The Community's legal centres turn away 160 000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the effects of further cutbacks in funding already in its infancy.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who cannot fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turning away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already at the Community's edge are preparing for further operations.
In June next year, these legal centres are to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
The legal centres in the Queensland Community are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from essential services every year he said.
People who are leaving violent relationships, with uncontrollable and crippling debts, families in disarray, unfairly dismissed workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning that thousands of unprotected Queenslanders will have to navigate complex legal problems without assistance.
We urge the Minister for Justice and the Senator for Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the provincial government fulfilled its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to consider the needs of the Community legal centre and its client communities and the Palazcuc government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after a worker was allegedly armed with a weapon.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while they were driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent Bordin, a former software practitioner for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before he realized that nothing was going to happen.
Chief Earl Phillip pulled out a gun, put his right fore finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee, Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to local and regional campaign officials, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had had similar experiences with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Aces do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage when he told the public in North Carolina that the people of the Second Amendment - which usually includes gun owners and gun owners - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his word out of context and that he was not for violence.
The appeal from Bordin calls for compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional abuse.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, the local news agency in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His call to Innovative Consulting Services, his consultancy, was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow brings revival and prosperity to the whole country, not just to the local communities and across London.
To me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just like the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we worked so hard to make sure that all of our people and our region would benefit from the games.
The Olympics were a huge asset to Stratford and the East End.
And we're doing that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
The Commission will also consider the possibility of a new pilot project to be implemented in the future.
As before the 2012 London Games, some may think the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There's always a roadblock to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that's asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion will create up to 180 000 new jobs and bring about £211 billion of economic growth, leaving behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for the fifth year in a row, to T2, which was built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement a third stairway, supported by £16bn of private money.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a huge success.
It's time to channel the spirit of the Olympians and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook for blocking ads in the Cat and Mouse game
For companies that make money from online advertising, companies that bypass ad-blocking programs are in the "goose and mouse" game, said one of the companies that make such programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its computer-based pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the software's filters to again block ads on social networking sites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the code of its websites around ads to make it harder for blockers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circulated a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock's Ben Williams wrote that a "processing battle" like this has been going on between the open source ad-blocking community and its peripherals since the ad-blocking was invented, and that Facebook may soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a powerful indication of how much grief advertising blocks have become for industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year, nearly four times the number who used them in 2013.
1.03 million daily active users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is following the blocker for computer-based pages, as the mobile blocker does not work in Facebook's mobile applications for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of activity worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its advertising targeting tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site from non-advertising content.
This is not a good experience for people, and we plan to tackle the problem, a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway apparently because of suicide .
Victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was left on the highway under multiple vehicles in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman took a desperate action and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who apparently attempted suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who urged them and all witnesses to report.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That's for the prosecutor to decide, Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - both of which involved a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the charges of negligence causing death by shooting and killing a man who was lying on A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drinking and had stopped on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police responding to the emergency call were driving in a legitimate manner and that the man's presence on the road was a "totally exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited.
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed the model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the heating of Venus, its waterproof surfaces and its carbon-filled atmosphere could sometimes be Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation is due to its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet it could have been rotating slowly.
The model also looked at the early surface formation of Venus.
Earth likely had drier areas, but there was once enough water and geographic diversity to enable life and to protect it from rapid water evaporation.
The early Venus also had a 30 percent dimmer sun.
In a simulation of the GIS model, Venus's slow rotation exposes its midday sun for almost two months at a time, GIS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick cloud layer that acts as a rain shade to protect the surface from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperatures of the earth's climate are actually a few degrees colder than Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story of Venus' evolutionary stages, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once inhabited, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen ran out, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with its deadly greenhouse gas effects, the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up coaching Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from the position of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of ice hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/general Joe Sakic confirmed the news and said the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been doing my duty as Colorado Avalanche ice hockey vice president and head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination", said Roy, 50.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice-chairman of ice hockey affairs must be in full alignment with the vision of the organisation.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Patrick told me today about his decision, Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him all the best in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach for his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs to Colorado, and the team has not advanced in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 ties, and they lost to the Wild by five points, losing to the Wild in the Western Conference wild card tie.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The North Sea oil workers' wage struggles will be postponed when all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have been occasionally organised on North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute.
We will hold several meetings throughout the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the unions, their recent labor strike, which they say is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group cut the remuneration of North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's reduction in remuneration follows a 10% decrease in contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that the additional operations would give the company the necessary mobility space to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people in its employment and announced plans to leave its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it eases operations following its massive merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest Northern sea labour disputes of our generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, in the North Sea and across the country", he said in his statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the previous five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation .
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete list of the speeds of the Pleiadian constellation.
The new information helps astronomers understand why stars in a galaxy orbit at varying speeds and how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other galaxies, we can now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of the solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the galaxy were born about 125 million years ago and are just now reaching maturity.
They're spinning at their peak now.
At their peak speeds, these mature stars absorb large amounts of stellar air.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's orbit by tracking the appearance of recognizable starbursts, such as sunbursts.
The latest list of stars' speeds suggests that stars with a higher mass are moving slower than stars with a lower mass.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones making the pips more slowly than the smaller ones.
In the Pleiadian Ballet, we see that slow spins are usually more massive, whereas the fastest spins are usually very light stars, Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian galaxy is so close, it's the ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at speeds of rotation.
The Pleiadian constellation offers theoretical models of the rotation of the anchor stars, which include both younger and older directions, Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their spinning speed and so to speak hang their dancing nails.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiadian speeds in three articles to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
