I was amazed.
The first prize was won by the innovative headphones project "Safe headphones" by Dastan Aitbai from Kyzylorda.
He was awarded a special diploma and a certificate of 300 thousand tenge.
The earphones of the team are a truly innovative project.
It is well known that today's youth are not separated from their smartphones.
Children and young women who are wired to their ears with their cell phones and are wearing earphones from the outside are not able to hear the signal when a car comes from outside the flag.
Some teenagers who leave unauthorized traffic lifts are in the process of getting into accidents.
The same people who didn't want to listen to the adults were recognized by Dastan as inventors.
The earpiece is a safety signal inside the earpiece.
When the signal of cars, road workers, and emergency vehicles is activated, the music in the earpiece stops immediately.
The sound of the approaching vehicle is interrupted to indicate the danger has arrived by the sound of the stop.
The Governorate of the region and the leadership of the Kyzylorda State University named after Khorkit Ata have proposed to develop such devices to help prevent hazards.
Dastan's project was thus ranked first.
The second place was shared by the project "The Chinese business idea" of Chingishan Sadov of Lyurdyurstan and "Health Center" of Umirzak Esbolatov of Sybary district.
The third place was won by the owner of the project "Tighin workshop" Gülnür Uderbayeva, the author of the logistics center "Logo Center" Walihan Taskara and the owner of the project "Little ladies" School Akbota Bazarbay.
The winners and laureates were congratulated by Deputy Governor Ruslan Rustemov.

Over the last 6 years, a total of 4.5 million tons of production were lost.
This is investment, jobs and business.
In the current year alone, more than 600 thousand tons of oil shortages were noted according to forecasts.
But as a result of the systematic measures taken in the region, at the end of 2017 we have reached a positive vector of GDP for the first time in the last 4 years, or 100.8%.

She says she was the mother of the deceased.
But the mother of the dead woman does not believe this.

When reading a book, one must think ahead of time about what one will get out of it.
In the story, our teacher, Askar Tokpanov: I saw you talking on TV.
It's not bad.
Draw thy mind to thee, read thy heart, and go not away with a proverb.
He read all the poems of Abai himself.
I also read the poetry of Abai and Mugali.
I read it over and over again.
You will remember what you read.
When I was young, my memory was strong, and I was quick to remember.
Today, that's all I have.
I'm basically a guy who can easily get anywhere and talk.
My heart is with them that mock their name, that are in pain.
This is a gift!
I will get 42,700 tenge this month.
I am happy as always, though he hates to give.
Now, that may not be a lot of money for some people, but it's not too little for me.
Now, starting with the utilities, all the food on the table is for sale.
The money added will pay for one of these.
Give it to me.
Thank you to the President!

This elevator was a Soviet-era thing that nobody needed in the 90s.
The company Elevator Agrofood has restored it to its best and now retains and buys quality wheat, which is now grown in the Torgai region, with a clay, a sweetness of around 30.
We have a lot of interest in the wheat of our region of Thurgau, which is China, the Arabs, and Russia.
We will soon have a strong German factory with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, and we will employ another 10-15 people.
We think we will have the opportunity to increase our salary.
Today, 22 people work in the elevator.
We have increased the salaries of 5-6 people who receive 32-33 thousand tenge per month.
It's just the basic salary.
The work in agriculture is not always time-consuming, sometimes extra hours are paid when additional work is needed", says the executive director of the elevator, Kurman Abdrahman.
Elevator Agrofood Limited Company is committed to the further development of the quality of storage and processing of durum wheat.
Now, Iran is cleaning and sorting it to make it greasy.
The President's mission will be fulfilled without fail.
Why are we going if we don't develop the economy, if we don't benefit the country?
This is a debt of every entrepreneur, - says Kurman Turganovich.
A businessman who is a hard worker is also a firm believer.
The fact that the Soviet Red Army's Red Zendets celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all cities and towns of Kazakhstan in a big way is critical of our country, brother.
This means that the Komsomol people first of all "crawled" to the independence of the Kazakh country.
In the city of Semily, the golden capital of the "Alashorda", which was the beginning of the Kazakh statehood, news has circulated that the Red Zendets, led by Nurlan Omarov, have made great efforts to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Red Zendets.
I saw red pioneers in Kazakhstan wearing red ties in schools and I was so moved.
Now, when these Russian slaves, that is, the slaves of their own descent, were openly poisoning the minds of the young Kazakh generation, they were so angry with the poor people...
How can we understand that these Komsomol people have seized the independence of the Kazakh country and claimed to be slaves of Russia?
Woe to thee, that thou hast called the name of a slave a slave!
We should understand that the fact that they admit that they are actually obedient slaves of the herdsmen, that they openly express their "unconditional love" for Russia - first of all, that the present-day followers of the red Zendets of yesterday openly acknowledge the Russian loyalty that we still believe has not come.
In 1986 the current "eternal deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aytimova, in December 1986, one of them publicly insulted and cried out to Gennady Kolbin, the one who raised him in office, and another: "Colbin, I will bring you blood from his hair and punish you", then participated in the December, wrote a paper about the same national tragedy called "Zobalań", and in particular, in 1990 the Soviet Empire, as the author of the famous work "AZobatilik" radio show in Munich, which was made in a one-hour radio show and flooded the world, I, Zhumay, Zhumay, still remember the scandals of mothers who did not have a mother!
The Kazakh people who were still alive at that time did not forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as the first-born of my Kazakh nation, I openly condemn the followers of these red Zendets!
If our state is truly an independent state, I can say that the eternal president of this state has a day when he will openly punish the people as traitors of the state who openly threaten the independence of Kazakhstan or condemn them as a whole country!
And the people of the land were afraid, and they were afraid, and they said, We are afraid.
Wake up, my death, your next sleep will never be forgotten by history.
Never forget this, my death!

The children are not going to school.
I went out into the field, and my eyes were opened.
Lisa, an Australian traveler, says: "I went out of the city this morning and had to go back to my hotel after walking a bit.
Because the air is so dirty, it's hard to breathe.
I remember the fresh air in my country, and I saw that there was a lot of work being done in Australia.

The International Student Film Festival "Bastov" has started in Almaty.
This year, the festival will be chaired by the famous film director, screenwriter, educator Irakliy Kvirikadze.
The jury includes Silvan Kutandin ("Letters to Stein"), Russian actress Elvira Bolgová ("My Armenian Wedding", "Ogean Daughter"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazaraov and Kazakh Savit Kurmanbekov.
Along with the main jury, a jury of young cinematographers-students, as is the tradition of the "Bastoud" year, also works.
This year's student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
The Spanish director Яго Matteo Velasco, who won the "Bayo" only two years ago, is now the chairman of the jury, which will judge the talented students' work.
There are so many film festivals in the world, but "Bayout" is a really successful, good start.
The festival is an international event that is very useful for students, and we're here to get a little inside look at what the future holds for cinema.
And of course, there's an Oscar, there's a Cannes Film Festival, but you can't go there right away, so it's better to have a ladder like "Beginning" that leads to the big competitions.
Most importantly, literacy, a new worldview, we want to lead the way to the world of great festivals, to the unknown, young talented people", says Яго Матео Веласко.
As guests of honor of the festival, Kim Yen Du, dean of the faculty of film production of Korea university of media arts, sound director of "Mosfilm" Marina Nigmatullina and filmmaker, professor of the University of Karpenko-Karogo in Ukraine Evgeny Filippows were invited.
The jury and guests of the festival will hold creative meetings and mastery hours with students of Almaty studying cinematography, film professionals.
All the events of the festival, mastery hours will be held at the National Academy of Arts and the University of Turin named after T. Jurgenov.
The international film festival arena is important for youth.
From the very beginning, students should see what competition is, what their classmates are doing, and how their peers in other countries are doing.
The festival is different from the film festival, and the interaction with the filmmakers and the exchange of ideas is even different.
"Start" is a crucial step in establishing a creative relationship.
Despite the complexities, the difficulty of making a step into the big screen, cinema is still evolving.
Film festivals are also essential for this purpose.
Film is a collective work, the international cinema language is universal, and we contribute to its development.
We will not only enjoy the film here, but also learn how to make it, says the president of the festival Sergey Azimov.
According to the organizers, the student film festival, which was cut off during the Soviet period, is being held for the 7th time this year.
Despite the difficulties, the film festival has survived despite the interest of the film community.

"A man's mouth is full of water".

Most importantly, the recipients learned that our product is natural, that the milk is real, not raw, but natural.
Many people asked, "How can you find your product in the region?"
"DEP is working hard to cover the entire market of Chelyabinsk region, and then we will go to Yekaterinburg", said Vadim Yamaltinov.

The foolish girl, who thought that the skin of the subtle ones would be remembered when the sun was cold, showed pictures of the girls in all kinds of beautiful clothes and even showed them to the addresses of the stores.
He was so overwhelmed that he wrote to his "clients" via WhatsApp to avoid being recognized by the country.
They promise to bring the tons home to attract buyers.
The company also requested that 100% of the money be transferred to Qiwi-amyan in advance.

About the change of the Kostanay region to Torgai.
The governor of Kostanay region, Arhimed Muhambetov, expressed his opinion on the initiative to name Kostanay region as Torgai region.
At the briefing held in Astana today, the initiative group asked about the open letter of the region about changing the name.
I know the letter.
I saw it.
I'm generally against it.
The history of the region of Kostanay has its own name.
If I'm not mistaken, 17 people signed the letter.
I know a few people.
In my personal conversation with them, Sabirjan Ahmetovich, who was the governor of many districts, refused to sign the letter.
Kalibek Deripsaldin (composer) also said that he did not sign the letter.
And I think that is why it is not right to disrupt the people here", said Arhimed Muhambetov.
The governor of the region noted that the name of the settlement should be changed and that hearings should be held.
So, we'll see.
But I'll say my point in general.
We have a district center that has been formed under the name of Torgai.
If the name of the city of Kostanay was called Torgai in the thirties and forties, then it is worthwhile to work on restoring the former name.
And here my position is against it", said Arhimed Muhambetov.

In general, there is no doubt that the need to strengthen the tasks that require specific regulation in the legal sphere and create favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage sites, - said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to establish the procedure for identification and registration of historical and cultural heritage objects at the legislative level, as well as monitoring their status, and to introduce new quality mechanisms for preservation and use of historical and cultural heritage objects in the final historical context.
In addition, it is recommended to conduct archaeological work and establish the rules and conditions for combating "black archaeology", determine the legal regime of land use in protection zones, regulate the construction of monuments of history and culture, determine the legal regime of use of natural landscape zones.
International experience was studied and taken into account in the process of drafting the law.
For example, Russian legislation includes measures to combat "black archaeology" for conducting illegal archaeological investigations, smuggling of archaeological objects, evasion of the transfer of artifacts to the state and others.
That is, criminal liability is provided.
Italy has obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them, it is planned to create and update periodically lists of cultural and artistic objects of historical and artistic interest and located in private.
In addition, the objects in their possession are subject to state protection, regardless of the nationality, citizenship of the owners of these objects, - said A. Mukhamediy.

The college leaders are deceiving the country and the authorities.
The Prosecutor's Office of East Kazakhstan region conducted an investigation into the activities of colleges in the region and identified numerous violations of the law, as well as the fact of unintentional expenditure of budgetary funds.
In particular, the fact that the state order was placed was not observed, false training of students, illegal appointment of grants, failure of teachers to meet the qualification requirements, failure to provide students with dormitories, as well as income from illegal leasing of state property was detected.

He taught 12 students at a neighborhood college.
Teachers and production teaching masters during the course of study gave these students a rating in theoretical and practical study journals, sent them to interim certification, transferred them from the course to the course.
In addition, the total amount of damages to the state amounted to 8 million tenge, which was paid to these students.
The case is currently under investigation.
The College also identified the fact of illegal use of property for personal purposes.
