This confirms the already widely-held theory that only some dinosaurs had feathers, and provides details on colour and three-dimensional structure that are not usually provided by descriptive fossils.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on the surface and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack the developed stems, which are called rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbels - researchers have speculated that the rachis, and these other features may have been a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for thermal control or display. Although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggest that the specimen shows a developed wing, not a hump.
Although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the results of the model suggest that it has adult scales, and that it was not on the back of a chick.

He is awaiting indictment and trial, but his testimony could be tarnished at any time because of the widespread publication of his film.
This is common practice in England, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said 'journalists are on a dangerous path as they publish photos of suspects.'
The High Office, which administers the overall responsibility of the cases, indicated to the press that no further comment would be made at least until the charges were brought.
According to the leaked document, the document would be about the border dispute over the Palestinian claim to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics mentioned concern the future province of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the valley once the agreement is signed, but the PA agrees to leave only five years of military presence.
Since the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, conservationists should closely monitor the shooters in the sub-pest control test.
The event was co-sponsored by NWS and Sporting Shooters Association Australia (NSW) Inc. and was staffed by qualified volunteers under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, WWS's alternate director of park conservation and heritage, all four of the selected shooters have been given full security and training details.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEB as part of the country's move towards new elections.
The commission is Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Some of the gay-violent protests were fueled by the failure to hold elections since 2011.
There were 60 reported complaints of iPads overheating and not working, which resulted in a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported 27 equipment-related accidents.
"Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional heat waves, which the company said were 'not extreme.'
In response, the ministry said that Apple's postponement of the report was 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Marianas said there was no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists on a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza used his M16 rifle to shoot tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, children and elderly, were released first, as were the Philippine photographers.
Photographers took the place of the grandmother who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Lickins began to inquire into premature birth in her spare time.
His research suggests that administering one's hormone may accelerate the maturation of the fetal lung.
Jinhewa said that government officials had found two 'black boxes' from the plane.
Luna was also honored by fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first king of the extremists", said Tommy Dreamer. "Luna passed away two moons into the night. She was as strange as she was determined".
'Luna is as bad as I am...maybe even worse...I love her, I'm sorry for her loss...I hope she's in a better place than this,' said Dustin 'Goldust' Rennels.
Out of the 1,400 who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were up 8 percent from 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, Cabinet Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent voted for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of the public believed Australia should soon be a republic, while 31 percent believed Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic swimming gold medallist was scheduled to compete in the 100m, 200m and three relays at the Commonwealth Games but due to his fitness, his participation has been questioned.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was forbidden in the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the Earth's source of water, as well as the organic matter that makes proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope that by using data from long-ago cometary collisions on Earth, they can understand how planets form, and especially how Earth forms.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called the rumours 'meaningless political talk and nonsense.'
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA says that NextGen will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save billions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions annually.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to point to aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional traffic is provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking and park-ride facilities on the grounds.
Fears of a lack of transportation may force the team to play behind closed doors, without supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved in two generations, although the process was believed to take longer, due to a cross-breeding between the Dartis finch, Geospisas fortis, and the Emigrant's Caddus finch, Geospisas conscriptus.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even into small cylinders.
It can be pulled into thin wires, twisted and knitted, and be hammered into sheets or rolled.
"It can be made very thin and layered on top of another metal. Sometimes it can be made thin enough to be used in hand-painted picture books called 'light manuscripts.'"
This is called chemical pH. You can use the extract of red cocoa to make a marker.
The eggplant changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the pH of the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (because the hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it with clean wet hands and hold the mixture.
The moisture in your hands interacts with the outer skin layers, giving it a fun feel and creating a kind of top porous.
In Harappa and Mogondoro almost every household has a flush toilet connected to a state-of-the-art sewerage system.
In Greece, the remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the cities of Crete and Santorini Minovan.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes used together by men and women as part of a public bath.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call from Earth and then reflects it back down immediately after the call is received.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visibility.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket is needed to go 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that the wheel has given us is that we have much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us railways, cars and other means of transport.
Below them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized food, ranging from rabbits to horned manatees and manatees.
Finally, many small cats (including domesticated cats) eat a wide variety of small insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is their concept of self, that each cat has its own special task, so that they don't compete with each other.
In lions, social cats live in large groups called pride.
A pride of lions is a group of one to three adult male lions and thirty female lions and their cubs.
Sisters and daughters within a large family are usually closely related to each other as women.
Wolves and dogs, like lions, are remarkably agile, but other cat species are not, and they are also very dangerous.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can jump, swim, and pull objects over great distances with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the great roar of the lion, but like a roaring phrase with words that speak.
The acylotes prefer small animals and try to catch monkeys, snakes, lizards and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the acylotes prey on are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that the ossilatus mimics the animals in the ground by sniffing and sniffing, and then eats them.
The axilus has excellent night vision and is a stealthy creature that blends in with its surroundings and hunts for prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) falls from a large group of people (if they go through a mountain or a river or migrate to a new island from which they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new crowd will need different features or variations to be stronger competitors than before.
The population will never change, and they need adaptations today as they did in the past.
Over time, new populations adapt to different environments, and therefore, they appear different from other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable result of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothing from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaur was the premier predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws have more than 70 blade-like teeth and an extra set of teeth on the top of its mouth, meaning that if anyone gets in its way, it cannot escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had very sharp teeth, and it may have fed on turtles and big fish and mosasaurs, and it may have been a carnivore.
It attacked anything that entered the water, and even a dinosaur as large as T. rex would not have come close to its size.
Most of the Roman food was familiar to us, and the Romans had a share of exotic or unusual banquets, featuring wild boar, deer, slugs, and the tormouse.
Another big difference is that the poor people eat in the same chairs as the women, but the rich people prefer to eat in the same lounges as the women.
The ancient Romans' cuisine could not have included foods that were introduced to Europe from Asia or the Americas centuries later.
For example, they never ate corn, tomatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman could ever have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to all their gods, and they considered it their home.
The people bring offerings to the gods. The Pandits try to satisfy the needs of the gods through festivals and ceremonies.
Each temple has an outdoor open temple and an indoor stone grotto, where only the Pandits are allowed.
Sometimes special pyramidal ziggurats were provided as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower, there was a special shrine to God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home is not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open to the street.
The land of Canaan was not a large forest, so the wood was very expensive.
There was very little immigration to Greenland. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. They say that when he went further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
His invention was already in use by the Eskimo tribes.
Although all the countries were 'Scandinavian', Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had many differences in people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
'The text of the Declaration of Independence is printed on the back, 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears in reverse at the bottom of the document.'
The large leather document (its dimensions being 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was wrapped in a protective case, and no one knew who wrote it.
So, the notation may have been added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the east was not yet liberated.
'It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who had made peace with the Germans in the 1940s and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.'
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned back toward Germany.
A single culture is a large group of people working together and living together in harmony as a community.
The word civilization, from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and civitas, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning country or province of a country, somehow defines the size of a community.
City-states are precursors to countries. A civilized culture is one that is based on the sharing of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Small civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are missed without being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states - with only Congress - formed a weak central government under the Confederate definition.
The Congress party had no power to levy taxes and, lacking a national administration or judiciary, relied on largely uncooperative government officials to enforce all its laws.
It had no power to regulate inter-state taxes and customs.
The state government took the central government very lightly as it required unanimous consent of all the states before these rules were amended and often their representatives were not there.
The German national football team, along with Italy's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, handball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and the Olympics.
Japan's 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), make it the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the grouping of Japan's islands, from a geographical point of view, Japan is called an archipelago.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European navigators recorded the name of the island they passed as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous grain production methods and using Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Japan was given full possession of Taiwan, which Japan ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
The buildings on the edges of the campus have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what most of the buildings were like in the beginning.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration efforts continue to this day.
For example, the most commonly used standard photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format in the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly its aspect ratio was obtained by digital camera image sensor shapes.
Actually, the 35 mm shape, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high is a bit confusing.
So the aspect ratio of this pattern (the simple integer ratio divided by twelve) is said to be 3:2.
Many common systems (for example ABS-type systems) have a natural rate equal to or close to this natural rate.
The rule of thirds, often derided, is a simple guideline for generating energy while maintaining a certain amount of order in a photograph.
The key theorem states that the effective space is the point of intersection of the lines that divide a shape into three vertical and horizontal segments (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has been building up the European nations beyond their differences in language and customs.
The power that was in all of this affected everyone from the king to the common man.
The use of money to alleviate suffering and poverty is one of the Christian doctrines, and the financial wealth of the churches is there mainly for this reason.
The central authority of the churches has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth in one place leads many to question whether fundamental doctrines are being carried out.
As these protests flared, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, as enshrined in many international treaties of the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective in cutting off key military and civilian supplies.
The British had buried net bombs in international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain parts of the sea, and posed a danger to neutral shipping.
The tactic had little effect, and Germany expected a similar result from unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing mood of most citizens and nations was one of calm and solitude.
The countries that had witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation that he had received from Charles Baechler (his manager at his previous job) to give to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinct system of government in different periods; each family in China at each stage or in power was a distinct dynasty.
Provinces were divided between each dynasty and a stagnation prevailed. The Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties, is best known for this period.
During this period, there was a fierce battle between several nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people fought and died for the highest office in the great palace of Xi'an.
The use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation is not about individuals but about the people have had a multitudinous social and political impact.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, the most ambitious and successful.
These are applicable to the military as well, as they are based on capability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired revolutions among the oppressed working-class populations of other countries.
"Muhammad was deeply involved in matters beyond the world. He frequently went to the cave later known as the 'Hira' on the 'Nur' (light) mountain to meditate".
He placed a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations in the cave, which has not been erased by time.
Located on a (1) hilltop north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knew it was there, it would be difficult to find it. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky above and surrounded by many mountains, and very little to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or 'Gizes Necropolis' in the Egyptian Valley contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'upper arch' was like a V and the 'lower arch' was like a stepped cross or a square without a lower part".
If you're on top, you're going to start from the tip of the arrow, and if you're on the bottom, you're going to start from the frog (where your hand is holding the arrow).
While a lower bow is more powerful and emphatic, an upper bow will normally produce less noise.
Feel free to write your own scores, but remember that a worship piece is for the sake of music, so it should be revered in general.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were driven from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a gang of beggars.
As they were returning to Paris in a carriage, a mob surrounded the carriage, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
(1) At one point, a mob member held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the dying queen.
The cost of the American imperialist conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, which provided the bulk of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the main benefits of U.S. imperialism may be the huge profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that inspired the organization.
The period of time in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages, all of which, according to tradition, ended in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological motivation or technological imperative to a rigorous sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
"Theories of theories of technology express the idea that technological development follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence and that the 'effects' of technology on society are more natural than social effects".
For example, one might say that the motor car is the necessary basis for the development of roads.
However, nationwide road connectivity is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed in an effort to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The fact that people own cars also causes a lot of road accidents, which has allowed the health sector to find new techniques to repair injured bodies.
The greatest aspect of the cultural element derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel was in Romanticism.
As for romanticism, geography shaped the individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these were better suited to be in harmony with society than arbitrarily imposed laws.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was popular in the middle of the Renaissance, from about 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its status began to decline in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with more valuable silk and spices than the Byzantine markets could provide.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of civilization was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was predominant between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early on, the Byzantine culture of the East had a major influence on clothing.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
It was only at the end of the Middle Ages that Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of that time was the use of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of farming only the food that a farmer needs for himself and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses stored seeds, which are environmentally friendly and can be harvested by combining their crop rotation or other simple methods.
Historically most farmers were engaged in agriculture for a living, and this is still the practice in many developing countries.
Subcultures help to bring together like-minded people who feel left out of society's standards and help to develop an identity.
Subcultures may be unique because of the age, race, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture are those characterized by language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography or a combination of other factors.
Members of a subculture often assert their membership through their distinctive and iconic style of dress, behavior, and use of words.
The best way to emphasize the importance of socialization is to take back children who are exposed to bad luck and to the contempt of children or adults, and children who are not accustomed to being out in public.
"Such children are called 'feral' or 'rude.' Some rude children are sheltered by people (usually their own parents); in some settings, abandonment is also due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child has the full range of behaviour of the animal that it has raised, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Process learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather provides support to individuals who are gaining new learning experience or starting a new project using a new computer.
The scaffolds can be real or virtual, meaning that the editor is a scaffold as well as the little paper clip man in the micro-soft office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are intended to be able to question, trigger and explain procedures that might be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are also left in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, bullying, and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a careless, unproductive, uneducated environment, but they do.
We believe that foster care is a safe place for children.
Our foster care system is committed to providing safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
The foster care is expected to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the previous home.
The Internet integrates elements of public and private communication.
Some of the notable features of the Internet are its use and its use, which leads to additional dimensions of a content-based approach.
For example, learning and socialization are the main drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Both ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were found to be novel activation factors by Imee and Mykord when they studied audience responses to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in subtle emotional expression and facial movements that can last only a few seconds.
In particular, it is said that by correctly interpreting the content of a person's micro-emotions, one can detect whether he is lying.
In The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks points out that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can be accurately measured for their sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to mimic human behavior could be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutations add new genetic variants and the selection removes it from the said mutation.
The distinction between the two generations is further differentiated by division and reorganization.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino-acid needs from available plant resources.
And failure can have severe consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant material is the protein found in leaves and cereals, but for mammals like us, it's hard to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ant, insects, eggs) is easily digestible but contains high-quality protein with all the amino acids it needs.
All things considered, it's not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem, as the chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is when you wake up for some purpose from your normal sleeping time and fall back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back only the memory without waking you completely from sleep.
If you are going to stop your watch while you are asleep, put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to stop it when you wake up.
Other biorhythmic-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, and the well-known urine separator) before bedtime, which prompts us to wake up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is related to the degree of tension in one's body and soul.
Every human being who has less ego, more positive life has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
We can all reach the enlightenment, but the obstacle to this goal is our tension and our negative thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended by the great path of love and by a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, and they are Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. By manifesting various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated and the sense of enlightenment is created.
Since Germany was a common enemy in World War II, there was cooperation between the USA and the USSR. After the war, organizational, methodological, and cultural differences kept the two countries apart.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, with fake troops, on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken down, and the hope was to reconstruct the crossing of the Roman bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 troops entered from the Soviet Union's Red Army. The Red Army had invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, created the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts, and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
It is the traditional job of the Navy to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while it is their job to impede your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boat types, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have invaded Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
It seems that sheep were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
The ancient cultures and tribes knew how to access milk, hair, meat and skin easily.
Domestic sheep were raised in herds and roamed the hills or grazed the meadows, often led by children or young adults, especially by a so-called shepherd, popularly known as a shepherdess. This form of herding is still in circulation today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
The wagon tracks, although only consisting of wooden parallel boards, allowed the horses pulling them to pull at a tremendous speed and to pull more weight than the somewhat rough roads.
Early on, cross-bar laws were introduced to hold the tracks. However, it was felt that if an iron bar was gradually placed on top of it, the tracks would still be viable.
Although this had become the usual practice, it caused a lot of wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carriages.
Over time, wooden wheels became iron wheels. In 1767 the first all-iron track was introduced.
The first known transport was walking, and humans began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, the bipedal feature is found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, we can act as activists to mitigate some of the future impacts.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic therapy, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and address it.
It is obvious that the world has changed so much because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and the problems have increased due to the increasing population and the very luxurious lifestyle of the humans.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away, after being signed by both Congress leader John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson.
"Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made, and they are now called ""Tunelope Brochures""".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 thousand pages of the extant Tanakh are the oldest surviving copies of the original manuscript.
Many paleontologists still believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of themselves as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are still many things that make birds look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like the T-rex.
All the computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, in computer parlance, bits.
Internal swelling may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of indoor poisoning may be an open container of medication or household chemicals.
See the specific label in the first aid recommendation for the particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the formal sense of this group of insects.
The term is related to the older term for cockroaches, which have adapted to become parasites living on humans.
Both bedbugs and larvae are nest-dwellers, living either in the nest or in the nest of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples are choosing adoption programs for their children.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parent.
The main goal of science is to find out scientifically how the world works, and this system actually leads to a lot of scientific research.
It's not just testing, and testing is a choice that is used to reject one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make notes and guide scientific experiments.
The naturalists and the philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were generally accepted in scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declines, the West feels cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely determined by biological clocks, mainly the presence and production of endogenous cycles.
Non-normal responses to external cues have been documented in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to rotate smoothly even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key suggestions that DNA is a genetic material is the Hershey and Chase test.
Hershey and Chase used either bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They tested the DNA in the meal with phosphorylated phosphate or the protein in the meal with sulphorylated sulphate, and they did two (2) tests.
The effects of mutations can be varied, depending on the mutation, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the atoms have been altered.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is a major attraction for people who go to natural places to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, taking photographs, watching birds and visiting parks and reading information about the environment are examples of on-site activities.
For example, the Arkantuangs of Borneo, taking pictures, learning and exploring.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to their workplace, and they pass other workers on their way to their workplace.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and served by a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this giant carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport system, and almost everyone complains about the transport system.
You've heard similar complaints in developed countries about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic jamming is the study of the movement and interaction of vehicles and individual drivers between two points.
Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to analyze traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to drive vehicles within a reasonable steady range; thus, traffic has a reasonable consistency, and they are mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships are established between three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to escape enemies easily and to find food and mates efficiently.
Most insect species have the ability to fold their wings back into their bodies.
This provides them with a wide range of small hiding places to escape from the ferocious animals.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the thumb-tailed bat and the mayfly.
A thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right and many people thought he was wrong, that the solar system, including the sun, revolves around the earth (and so do the other planets).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth. It has 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon River, six miles wide, is the widest river on earth.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were not surpassed in size and construction technology.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Although Latin is used mainly in religious ceremonies, Italian is also the language of everyday life for the working people in the country.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People are aware of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, which were extracted in ancient times, because they were all found in the pristine form of nature, and mining with ancient tools was simple.
The philosopher Aristotle said that everything is made by the combination of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
He thought that the four states of matter were the same (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but they would change into new matter, creating what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two (2) or more metals. Let us not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like gold and silver.
You can get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, and yet you could put a trillion of them at the end of this line.
So, pencils were a good friend to many people when they were first made.
It is a pity that the pencil has been reserved for less status and uses as new writing systems have emerged.
People are now typing messages on the computer screen, and they don't have to go near pencil sharpeners to write them.
When something new comes, one can wonder what magic the keyboard can do.
The fusion bomb works on the principle of using energy to bind together a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
Releasing some of that energy by re-separating the embryo is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have a non-stable nucleus, meaning that they can split with little or no damage.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick inside and 100 km thick outside.
It is thin under the dark portion of the Moon's surface and thick under the highlands.
As the upper mantle is thin, there may be more maria on the near side. The subvolcano was easier to rise to the surface.
Content theory is about what people like or what people choose.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or preferences that are internalized as they age.
These theories look at people and make them do things they want to do, and then examine what their environment makes them do and what it doesn't make them do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally speaking, there are two (2) kinds of behavior that managers may exhibit when they lead their former peers. One (1) end of the spectrum is "being one of the others".
Such managers may have difficulty in making difficult decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding them accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one is transformed into an unidentified individual who thinks he or she has to change everything that the group has done and create as they wish.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often causes division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are just as good as regular teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as a liaison and facilitator for the group of people next to them.
They often have a greater right to self-management than regular teams, because their teams may be in different time zones, which may not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of an invisible team (Larsen and La Pasto, 1989, p. 109) is a characteristic component of virtual teams.
"The 'invisible team' is the executive team, and all members report to them about their status. The 'invisible team' rates each member. "
Why does the company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning company? The only goal of implementing enterprise learning concepts is to use innovation.
If all the resources are used well by all the departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence will be of benefit to all.
As a result, a company's process working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's demand.
Before a company can innovate, leadership must create a culture of enabling innovation, knowledge sharing with colleagues, and corporate learning.
Angel (2006), explains that the use of continuous methodology can lead the company to achieve large-scale performance gains.
Neurological data provide a great deal of evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and so it narrows down the research area and makes it more precise.
The link between neuro-pathology and behavior is helping scientists to research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, scarring, tumors, and other injuries, can affect activities and cause some changes in mood.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore the brain's previously unseen structures and processes.
It provides more information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand our minds.
Although AI is associated with scientific innovation, AI is also an important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning and intelligent change.
AI research involves building machines that can automate subtle tasks.
Examples include control, planning and organizing, the ability to detect customer demand and answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now mostly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also installed in many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. A teacher will often want to take her students to places where buses cannot travel.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can visit museum art, visit a fish gallery or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a short trip to the field in a visual way is the best way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year the Penn State of North Carolina designers a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are offered for scrap online.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually transforms them.
Since students are the most important characters, Black writers try very hard to avoid controversy.
"And blogs 'make readers curious about the world around them. The idea of feeding readers' curiosity makes them intelligent and interesting' (Toto, 2004). "
Blogging is a tool that can be used to promote and support learning well beyond the current school day.
"The proper use of blogs can make students 'more critical and analytical; they can also give their own response to the opinions of their peers and take a stand when answering online questions' (Oraweek 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital city and home to an array of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's heritage and innovation.
The Niagara Falls in the southern corner, the Muscooga in the north and the surrounding areas are of unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things further highlight how Ontario is considered the greatest Canadian.
The large areas further north are very densely populated. Some are almost uninhabited desert.
A demographic that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are a group of islands in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.

Women: It is recommended that any female passenger declare that she is married irrespective of her original marital status.
It doesn't seem very expensive, but it's useful to wear a ring.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can be considered harassment and that following us, holding our hands, etc. is not unusual.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to express your firm intention (even if there are cultural differences, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marrons, as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Tarou l-Batiya, and it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy things in Morocco overall.
Around the Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as daisies, pottery, leather goods, hooks and a spectrum of geek's, but this is only for old tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the eastern corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma, Nyiragongo, was destroyed by lava from the volcano, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, research needs to be done to understand the state of the fighting outside Goma, in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the Bodo-Bodo (motorcycle taxi) to get around the commune. Usually the short ride (local) costs ~500 Congolese francs.
"Thingdu, with its relative inaccessibility, has been used as a metaphor for the ideal, distant lands".
Today, Timbuck is a dying town, although the town attracts tourists with its reputation and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of the world's ancient sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This is one of the main stops in the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is completely different from the rest of the country because it has an Arabic flavor instead of African.

The most significant indigenous group, the Guaraní, are semi-nomadic hunters who live in what is now eastern Paraguay, where they also subsist on agriculture.
The Chako area is home to other inland tribes, the Guaicuru and the Biagua, who make a living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born out of the struggle between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups in what was formerly known as the Great Indian Province.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has retained its indigenous character and identity.

The riders are supported by a saddle ring that is hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide great stability for riders, however safety concerns arise due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck.
When a rider is thrown off the horse, if his foot gets caught in the saddle, he is likely to be dragged off while the horse is running. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear soft, low-heeled, short boots.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety barriers that help a horse to fall off the saddle leash if pulled backwards by a fallen rider.

Skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as early as 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing has been a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski tourism or ski hiking.
It is related to, but not subordinate to, Alpine Style ski touring or mountaineering. Mountaineering is generally done on steep terrain and requires very hard skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Ideally, the distance can be increased by crossing the course - but the speed of cross-country skiing can often be increased on tracks for overweight men.
Although Europe is a relatively small continent, it is made up of many separate countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel to many countries, it is necessary to make several visitor applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area behaves in this respect like a country.
As long as you live in this area, you can cross this border without passport control and checks.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define 100 year old items as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age range may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft goods can be defined as antique goods, although they are younger in age than the similar mass-produced goods.
