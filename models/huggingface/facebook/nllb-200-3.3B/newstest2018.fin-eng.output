Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the theme - "A person should have the right to their own body".
The ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts' Project Room is covered with dozens of patient records.
Each one of them has Camille Auer's name on it.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my personal medical history to make the violence of the process visible", Auer says.
By process, he refers to the process of gender re-correction.
It is often a years-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process starts with the referral to the diagnostic studies for 'gender identity disorder' carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process began four years ago.
Before this, he had already been using estrogen he had ordered online and was already well on his way to recovery.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to have their gender corrected legally.
The Translact, i.e. the law on the confirmation of the transgender sex (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, in the population register and in the passport.
At present, every sex-rectification patient is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
It's a human right to make decisions about his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights", says Auer.
The reform of the Transla Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight legal observations and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The amendment was prepared by the previous Finnish government, under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovis.
Elections were held and the Finns took control of the government.
Now the amendment is stuck again.
This is about domestic political disputes that have nothing to do with this particular bill.
"The government does not want to bring it up because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law", says Frank Johansson, director of Amnesty's Finland department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
The first is the packaging and instructions for the medicines used by Auer.
In the installation of the patient's medical record, anyone can read, for example, the transpolation of Auer by the psychologist of the Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and wrote a report based on these reports, which would determine Auer's treatment and help.
The perception of reality under study seems to be prone to fluctuation.
The self-concept of the person under study appears to be fragmented in a borderline manner, and unstable personality traits are emphasised.
Auer didn't identify himself in these photographs.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill", Auer says.
Even more shocking was the refusal to grant Auer a sex-reassignment procedure.
The medical staff said his resources were insufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of a meeting and kicked the transpo into the waiting room and smashed the TV.
Later, that television was the subject of a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is defined as a woman at birth can have breast augmentation, but breast removal requires a diagnosis", Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than the sex you were assigned at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of sex reassignment is more difficult for psychological reasons than for purely medical operations.
The people who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that their resources are insufficient", says Auer.
Many of the people who have applied for the process have a history of psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
The medical staff may decide not to start treatment on the basis of these.
"Denying treatment and assistance can plunge a person into a worse situation than before the process began", says Auer.
Auer's solo exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts all my adult life, and that is something that is usually difficult for people to digest".
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, she felt better.
He was finally able to express the feelings that had been there since childhood and adolescence.
Why a wide chin didn't feel right to my body and why my pectoral muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer has been to have people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"There's so much justification in talking, in dress, in tone of voice, in movement", she says.
Now Auer feels that she's being seen, that she exists as a woman.
But in the early stages of the process, the occasional comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
The thing that hurts me the most is when people close to me are misogynistic.
"They should know, and they know who I am, but they are not willing or able to internalize it", he continues.
But not all trans people crave physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body dysmorphia, in which the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
But without the use of hormones and a long research process, you can't get an official confirmation for your own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies", says Auer.
And it is true.
For example, in June 2014, the Danish Parliament adopted a new procedure for legal gender recognition.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal gender.
An adult applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity card, stating that he or she considers himself to be of the other sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry issues a new personal identification number to the applicant.
This right of self-determination is also demanded by Finland and this demand is also reflected in Auer's exhibition.
It's not a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic theosophical collection.
I want to believe that art still has value and that it can be used to bring about political change in an era when human rights have been forgotten by politicians.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The Civil Rights Commission has issued a travel warning for Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the national civil rights organization for African Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, citing the state's discriminatory practices and the racial attacks that have occurred there.
The NAACP's travel information for Missouri will go into effect on August 28, 2017, and it calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and locals to take special care and extreme caution when traveling in the state, which has recently seen numerous questionable racially-based incidents, the organization's press release states.
In addition, the state's enforcement of its laws disproportionately targets minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuance of the travel warning.
The civil rights of people are being violated.
"They're stopped because of their skin color and beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, Missouri president of the NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time.
The travel advisory for Missouri is the first warning issued by the organization for a U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year, driving across the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by Missouri State Police, though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel advisory also cited a study by the Missouri attorney general that found that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police than white drivers.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to encourage people to be vigilant and to warn their family, friends and coworkers about what can happen in Missouri", Chapel says.
 People must prepare by, for example, bringing money to pay for the bail or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, Missouri had 100 hate crimes recorded in 2015, the 16th highest number of any U.S. state.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for businesses to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, a constitutional civil rights organization, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that mandate police to arrest people for immigration offenses, which the organization says will increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and are for other countries, but recently, NGOs have issued them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's assessment of the aid in question is based on the information provided by the Icelandic authorities.
The Minister of Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä (Central) has asked Finnair to clarify the additional pension payment received by the airline's CEO, Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
The Minister says it's contrary to the will of the government.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by the wealthy came to the fore this week when the Helsinki News reported on the pay developments for directors of listed companies.
The newspaper Suomen kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's additional pension in February.
The Commission also notes that the capital injection of EUR [...] million was granted in the form of a capital injection of EUR [...] million.
The government has made it clear that supplementary pensions are not to be used for rewarding.
The government owns more than half of Finnair.
The company claims that the decision is in line with the decision on ownership management principles of last year.
The sanctions immediately made the speech harder .
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were going from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in Hamburg on the sidelines of the G20 summit of industrialized nations, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new sanctions that were passed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday, have been met with a bitter reaction in Russia.
The most damning response so far has been from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says that the immigration bill signed by Trump amounts to a "full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian reactions are just political rhetoric, as if they were exaggerations and exaggerations, the tensions between the US and Russia are a fact after the short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, passing the Russian, Iranian and North Korean immigration laws was not easy.
Although the law passed with a resounding majority in Congress, the president reportedly had a much harder time passing the law.
Trump has criticized the newly signed bill as "significantly flawed".
President Trump's impatience may have been due in particular to Russia, although the passage of a law that would restrict his own powers must have been repugnant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating both the possible Russian interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's Russian connections.
The tensions between the United States and Russia are real after a short honeymoon.
With the White House staff in a state of flux and various scandalous twists and turns revealed almost daily, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not made under the direction of the president but in spite of the president.
This is by no means a desirable situation.
If the relationship with Russia is a burgeoning one in the United States, the same is true for the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is straining relations.
The EU has been a prominent voice in its relations with Russia on the situation in Ukraine and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least in the main, the interests of the Member States are very different.
For a member state like Finland, which does a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the new US refugee law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The European Union is not prepared to accept the fact that the United States is not a member of the WTO.
Trade sanctions are a tool in world politics, a means of expressing displeasure.
But sanctions must be carefully considered and carefully controlled.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is there nothing sacred anymore?
The Trump White House is now aiming for the Statue of Liberty.
The lack of statues is a sure sign of a change of government.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's chief ideologues, knew exactly what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta, who had already attacked the Statue of Liberty in a debate over the president's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
If he had, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise ship operators and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, and particularly the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the statue  17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller's quote from Acosta: "I don't want to go into the history of it now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller wasn't wrong in his own mind, but it's not just history, as he said.
The most moving words of Lazarus are the only words of his that state calls not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore".
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, he was a writer who made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcome in Trump's America.
The debate over the Statue of Liberty's meaning is part of a wider political and cultural debate over the meaning of the United States.
After Lazarus' death, his friends campaigned for the poem to be placed at the foot of the statue, knowing full well that the act was strongly political.
The statue was intended to express the links between French and American republicanism in a classic metaphor, the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the banished.
The incorporation of poetry into the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'etat and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the statue's meaning, and the right wing has long wanted to restore it to its original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh  The bellman, now seen as a sort of harbinger of Trump  claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not a call to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, who take America's light into a world enshrouded in darkness: Lady Liberty steps forward.
He's taking the flame of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fog doesn't show the way to the United States.
And, unusually, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on your perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's dock after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts us by giving us hope and welcoming us.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their sound shows no way but stirs the flames of anger, their only source of power.
2017 World Championships: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scotsmen made the Great Britain team
Neil Black, chief executive of the British Amateur Athletic Union, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team taking part in the World Championships are 'a remarkable confirmation'.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
Black said there was something special about the event in Scotland that British sport should learn from.
'This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake,' says Black.
I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they felt that it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Amateur Athletic Union, on the other hand, believes that it is linked to the Federation's activities,
The British Amateur Athletic Association believes that it is their actions that are behind it.
And the average street hustler thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's something quite powerful, whatever it is.
Many Scottish athletes are competing in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who is competing with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was named captain of the national team.
Eilidh is needlessly modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly brilliant, Black says.
The athletes left the event feeling proud of their achievements and highly motivated, no matter where they happened to live and train.
There was a genuine feeling and passion for sport in Eilidh's words.
Eilidh Doyle, Commonwealth Games silver medallist in the 400m hurdles, and this is her fifth world championship, feels it's "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle distance runner, has set five British and two European records in the past year.
He's competing in London in the 1500 and the 5000.
Chris O'Hare is running the 1500 metres in London, and he too is worth keeping an eye on: he has had an outstanding season, including victories in the British Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot he had as an extra was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is 'very proud' to have so many Scots on board, some of whom are really competing for places in the finals and medals.
"It's a great honour to be made captain, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain", says Doyle.
Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are in it as deserved athletes competing for trophies.
My captain's speech?
I thought it went pretty well.
I was just thinking about how lucky we are to have a pet.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm gonna get another chance to compete there, and I know the atmosphere is gonna be unbelievably great.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't take criticism
Our father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was irritating,
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is taken away, we may be led dumb and silent as sheep to the slaughter", said Washington in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should be taking lessons from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked the people who posted them.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the response was derogatory online as well.
"What does it matter? It's just Facebook, a lot of comments".
But it does matter.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the surprisingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He's got the second highest rating of any of the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to heat.
He has led the state with steadiness and a firm adherence to principles.
He has also used Facebook to great effect as his main channel of communication with his constituents, posting a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
So blocking users from the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous, because the governor's page is a public and official forum, and it's run by his staff with tax dollars.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was merely a matter of moderating the comments.
But labeling commenters as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed a group of people that Hogan had blocked on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to have a conversation with their elected leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and appropriate.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comments, trying to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile, but raised a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news", he wrote in the Washington Post news column.
I also cannot accept that when several people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as somehow organized as a force and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The governor's staff called the comments "a focused attack", while someone else might call them "a promotion of what they consider important".
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to control communication by blocking critics or deleting critical comments.
In the past, we should have sent staff to round up and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or arrest and silence protesters.
But it's really the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of manipulating Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users who have been blocked by President Trump are suing him.
The first significant decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria Circuit Court ruled that Loudoun County's government violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the ACLU was talking to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be too hard.
In Washington, cheap postage had an effect similar to that of the Internet today.
Newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers mocked Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers, in which they railed against Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Treaty, the U.S.-U.K. Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as evidenced by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington web project.
Yet, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and freedom of speech are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership is about accepting that fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
We've got samples from about half a dozen places, plus online reports from a couple, three.
Some of them have come from southern and eastern Finland, but also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says specialist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green bears have died of a disease called trichomonosis.
It's caused by a certain primitive animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been known to strike pigeons, particularly pigeons.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in the songbird.
In 2009, it was really cold.
At that time, trikomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green pine forest, after which the species' populations have been recovering.
The EU has been involved in the negotiations on the future of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy since the end of the Cold War.
The fear is that the previous epidemic of greenhouse beetles will recur if something is not done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately.
More on that later.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping to benefit from the home court advantage at the Renaissance Club.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to enjoy the benefit of home court for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, a Northern Irishman, led the tournament at neighbouring Archerfield Links last year before the final round but lost to Paul Eales, has been delighted with the new venue and is now the tournament broadcaster for the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
'I was delighted to see the Renaissance Club built, and with this event it will be in full glory,' says Rafferty.
The players see the pitch at its best, and it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a passionate ambassador of the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
This tournament is a great showcase for this stadium.
England's Eales defends the title for the first time, having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity", says the Southport resident.
I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open title because it's not on the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
I'm reminded of last year, winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time, and we will always remember it.
Gary Orr returns to the real world on his own soil, joining the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing on the home ground is always more meaningful than usual", says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've been enjoying playing again and playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far.
The trio will be joined on the court by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The six Scottish players taking part are Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, along with Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free entry to the tournament, and parking is £5 if there is only one driver, and £10 if there are at least two people.
All the proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The cask was used to determine any potential internal air problems.
The air-conditioning problems in the barracks of the Vestic Company of the Porin Brigade have not been detected, at least so far, the brigade reported on Thursday.
The internal investigation is continuing.
The investigation began when a man who had been suspended from his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to the poor air inside the barracks.
According to the commander of the brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holman, there are no problems with the health of the other men.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and no other men in that unit have had any health problems.
We take every complaint seriously and wanted to investigate this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, Holma says, there is no indication that we have an indoor air problem.
The brigade's press release says that the July arrivals had to move supplies to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of it, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a furnace in the kitchen.
He rarely uses his cattle.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's restive Papua province. When she cooks dinner, she usually puts the bataat  locally nota directly into the pan.
After half an hour, the fried potato is eaten with greedy, unwashed hands.
Dege's home is unfurnished, and he sits on a muddy terrace, where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing clothes in the water from the nearby marsh.
The toilet function is provided by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and she is not assigned to tend the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink heavily.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening", says Degei.
This is a rare foray into the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote in public in front of occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch occupation, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which has kept the area under tight control and barred access to foreign journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the eastern part of the island belonging to Papua New Guinea.
The remote and rugged Enarotali is reached by a flight of an hour and a half from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, followed by a five-hour, stomach-churning ride in a rented car.
There's no public transportation here.
The town of some 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo groves, whose waves have rusted the roofs to a brilliant blue.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the tribes of the Mee Pago in Papua worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this", says Degei, referring to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark lace and bright-colored sweater.
Before we had nothing but leaves to cover our bodies.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line and one of the highest rates of child mortality and illiteracy in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold.
Paniai is a highland area roughly the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Only about a hundred miles from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by the Freeport McMoran Company, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they mean the oppressive presence of a strong Indonesian military.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local units of the military nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid as much as $150,000.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this source of income, and they are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands more.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings of the highland tribes in Papua in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region for peaceful protests.
The Archdiocese of Brisbane's 2016 report We Will Lose Everything contains accounts of the atrocities of the previous year, including extrajudicial executions, torture  rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods  and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because there are cases every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The situation has tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslims from the populous Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi move into the area in hopes of a better livelihood.
Javanese warung restaurants sell fried chicken and gado-gado beans mixed in peanut sauce.
It's hard to compete with the locals.
Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a cheaper price than the local ones, says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital in search of work.
 Local women lost their customers. 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo  nicknamed Jokowi  promised to address Papua's injustices and human rights abuses during his 2014 election campaign.
Papua is made up of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Panya, on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice, You says.
The Panja experienced a kind of bottoming wave just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols at a bonfire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles.
Frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
Another soldier did not like the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to victims' and witnesses' accounts, the drunken soldiers abducted and abused children, beating them with rifle butts.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A few hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day the events began.
About a thousand Papuans - young men, women and children - gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and the army command center to demand justice.
With their hunting bows for festive occasions, they began to perform the traditional Papuan Mee Pago waita dance, dancing in a ring and mimicking the song of birds.
Some of the protesters began to throw stones at police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received an order on the internal radio system: If the crowds of people resist more than three times, shoot them to death. This information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been made public to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto area, predicted that the situation was out of control and urged the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine about the brightly painted wooden porch of his house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
 Multiple shots were fired in the air. 
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him", Johannes told TIME magazine with a sad face.
I saw that she was dead... and I kissed her.
Yotje Mende, a Papua police inspector, told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death. 
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the death was reported to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a moving speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
I want this case investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations of human rights violations outside the judicial system.
But he immediately began to cancel his appointments.
Most of the violations occurred long ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes", he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying he had no intention of starting an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court", he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" linked to the deaths of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence referendum in 1999, Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have already been solved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Pania victims are taking these allegations with a grain of salt.
I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way, says Yohanes.
I'm tired of this.
He says he still lives in fear, even though it's been years since the incident.
"Yes, I am", he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the Paniacs are too scared to discuss the incident.
He says that the soldiers had beaten him after he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will come looking for me after the victims are buried", he says.
The shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighborhood of Paniai in Deiya.
One man was killed and 17 were injured in a clash between villagers and the head of a construction company, which began when the head refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed medical attention was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been washed up on the river nearby while fishing and died on the way to the hospital.
The villagers, angry, demonstrated at the construction site in front of the company office.
According to the police, villagers stoned the officers, who responded with warning shots.
However, according to local people, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge", said Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyain parliament has called for the police officers who fired the shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the mid-Papuan highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by random attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Paniacs, like Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Panya in the name of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some of those who were arrested never returned.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a small amount of rice for sale at Enarotalli, and it's too expensive for the locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten of these are only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the gap between local and migrant income has widened, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
Jobs are scarce, and they tend to go to local, better-educated, more affluent immigrants.
Few Papuan have the capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
'Young people don't want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here,' says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniain tribal council.
The world's attention is drawn to the remote Papuan island.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite being granted a rare film permit, the official reason being their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing restrictions on reporting.
Journalists reporting on Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting, Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "the numerous and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papua liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations".
The locals want the governments of the outside world to intervene.
When a Dutch delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to a source who participated in the meeting and asked not to be named.
Indonesia is in the midst of a presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
'Jokowi means good, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pania shootings,' says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the Paniaians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, with virtually no health care and no educational opportunities.
Goba said that the Panamanians, like other Papuan people, consider their votes for Jokowi as a 'debt' that must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting incident once again symbolically resisted by burying one of the victims across the road from the police station and the military headquarters.
They know you may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed", Yacobus says, shaking his head.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora on the cancellation of the rematch with Robert Helenius: "Until the fans themselves don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
But the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, blames the whole reason for the re-fight flop on Helenius.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora whines.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full at the Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial penalty.
The ticket sales for the swimming match went well, and the promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There's been no news of the match since.
But the reversal no longer hurts Chisora.
The match would probably have been canceled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up in a terrible pain.
My tyrannie was about to explode.
They told me at the hospital that I had to have surgery, Chisora says.
The Brit says he's about 45 percent fit right now.
He's obviously not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he's got a big gun on Dillian Whyte.
Chisora was defeated by Whythe in December by a landslide.
You've come to power again in the Dubai of the Torch-Scratcher.
Fires engulfed the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter (791-story) tower.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called the Torch, the spark.
The building was evacuated and no one was injured, and the cause of the fire was not immediately known.
We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the shouts of people.
"We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about 10 minutes", a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's fire and rescue officials say firefighters extinguished the fire at 4 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that they would provide accommodation for those who had left their homes.
The case may re-raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
The board of directors of the Torch Building conducted a study after the 2015 fire, which found that the most damaged were the boards used for the façade cladding and insulation.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and cladding of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames that killed 80 people in June.
A mop was stolen from a parking lot in southern Iowa during the night.
A car was stolen from a parking lot in Riverside between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from the address of Ninivaara, on the 2nd floor of the Tikkamäentie.
The Mopo was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour and its registration number is 27-REV.
The body was found later Thursday.

More than 20 percent of U.S. airline passengers bring items on board that are prohibited by law, a survey reveals
A survey of airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of U.S. passengers had knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items onto airplanes past U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints, and at least six percent of passengers carried knives or other sharp objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said that they were later informed that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline, was completed by over a thousand passengers, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely than others to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were Generation Y passengers and less than 15 percent were Generation X passengers.
The most common violation of the rules was bringing food and liquids on board.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with a blade on board, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men said they had knowingly carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company that conducted the survey wanted to know how many had accidentally missed a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
Unsurprisingly, the most frequent travellers are also the most likely to smuggle goods past security checks, knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that did the survey points out, the TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what fluids they are allowed to carry on the plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a time, there was also the idea that books were not allowed on airplanes.
You can take liquids on domestic flights but not international flights.
Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, has reversed his decision to delay the Obama administration's decision to reduce emissions.
The day after 15 states sued EPA chief Scott Pruitt, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's emissions-reduction measures.
The change, says Mr Pruitt, shows that the agency he leads is taking better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt didn't say a word about the lawsuit against his previous decision in the federal appeals court.
The Member States should start complying with the 2015 requirement for surface ozone from 1 October.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as the attorney general of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA, is known for his opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA overstepped its authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration order against oil and gas companies that mandated companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his overhaul of the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
'During past administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach an agreement on schedules,' said Pruitt.
We do not believe in regulation through litigation and take deadlines seriously.
We also take very seriously the regulation of our activities and the powers it confers on us.
However, the EPA opinion found that Pruitt could still use his powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions were "reasoned and based on the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the bill.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group plans to continue to press.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant win for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the suit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Surface ozone is produced when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke cloud can cause severe respiratory problems in susceptible populations and is also responsible for thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists were delighted by Pruitt's surprise turnaround.
'It's worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our respiratory system use common sense,' says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
We must continue to fight against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups.
The supercar maker is coming to the streets with a SUV that's "Ferrari-style".
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while seeking to maintain its exclusive status.
That's what's likely to happen, but it's going to be Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, reports Automotive News.
All cases of eastern savon measles the same virus type
The Rantasalmi asphyxia is the same virus type as previous cases in Eastern Savonia, THL reports.
The virology laboratory of the Ministry of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles outbreak in Eastern Savona is the same virus strain as previous outbreaks.
The THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed in a beach-bound person on Friday, July 28th is the same virus type as previous cases in Eastern Savona.
On the basis of this information, all the cases detected in Eastern Savonia are linked to the first case of asbestos in the region in June.
And that's good news, because it means that we haven't found any other types of the ashesworm virus.
However, it is possible that new infections could emerge from the fifth case until mid-August, and the epidemic is not over yet, says Dr Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for infectious diseases at Soster's primary health service.
No new cases of suspected or confirmed cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
The EU is also looking to the EU to provide a comprehensive response to the challenges facing the EU.

Finland prepares for legal disengagement
They never even considered legalizing pontika soup.
On the basis that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to alcohol.
Making chili at home is legal next year, but legalizing pontica soup is not even on the table.
The sherry is made by fermentation, the brandy by distillation.
The reasoning behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
There has been no sign of political will to make the provision of pontika soup a human right, Government Councillor Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing to reform the Alcohol Act, they didn't consider the legalization of pontica distillation.
Nor was the matter brought to the political table.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'eco-label' in the directive.
He's on the negotiating team of the ruling party's parliamentary groups that took a stand on the alcohol reform law.
A licence to distill the pontica at home can no longer be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacture also remains subject to authorisation.
Judgment says that the home brewing of alcoholic beverages will have a simple rule: Alcohol may be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a scream at home.
The government has been trying to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes requirements on flavourings and aromas and allows the manufacture of the cork, Mäkelä points out.
The preparation must be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavour and aroma arising from their fermentation are clearly visible to the drinker.
The new law allows you to make as much of your own liquor as you want, and you can give home-made alcohol as a gift.
It's still illegal to sell it.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Justice Department.
The alcohol bill will be in the House of Commons as soon as the fall term begins.
The sitting is on 5 September.
The law will come into effect in early 2018.
The law is well-crafted.
It is as if the House had already made a decision, and the Council is delighted.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who had suffered chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital on suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius had a breast cancer, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for further investigation.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former world-class athlete was in good health.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in February 2013.
The phone calls that were leaked reveal that Trump has been pressuring Mexico to build a border wall.
The Washington Post has leaked the transcripts of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27, 2017 phone call, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States chastised the fact that he had publicly denounced the wall.
Trump kicked off his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also ran a story about Trump's first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which resulted in a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would accept refugees en route to Australia was "laughable", "disappointing", and "stupid". Trump said the deal negotiated during the Obama era would make him look "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day".
Georgian massacre: Activists re-stage racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues on toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car, and a white driver, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the pack, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and slides through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
Roger, the man is whining.
Get out of the car!
The screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled from the front seat.
This shocking event is, fortunately, only a reenactment of the one that occurred on July 22, 2017.
But the sighs of shock are real when the gallows is hung around Roger's neck.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to the bridge at Moore's Ford to re-enact the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
'It is astonishing that no one has been arrested in all these years, even though the murderers are among us and many need to know who they are,' says Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organise the re-examination.
It is the shame of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former congressman from Georgia.
For him, the re-enactment is an urgent call to action, but it's also a reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been righted.
'We want to see the guilty brought to justice, we want to see things finally resolved, and we want to heal from the grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice,' says Brooks.
 We can't recover and make amends until we get justice. 
A coroner covers the body of a victim of the Georgian massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, over 50 men were suspected of lynching in Monroe and the surrounding counties.
But no one was ever charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the state of Georgia's black voters were granted the right to vote for the first time in a presidential election by a Supreme Court ruling in April, and elections were held in the summer.
The FBI has confirmed that during the election, there was an incident in which a black tenant farmer named Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner named Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said there was a rumor in town that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with his child.
According to FBI records, a prominent white landowner named Loy Harrison paid Malcolm $600 in bail on July 25, 1946, which was used to secure his release from prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car just before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has been revealed that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders", the FBI report states.
It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, who were complicit in the murders, and who destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.
Brooks puts it in a very clear way.
It was voter-rights murder, he says.
 They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that they would be the same if they went to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgian massacre for nearly a decade.
The play is extremely realistic and compelling, and it's a depiction of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to watch, which is what Greene says it's supposed to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark side", the director says.
But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through.
This year's show began rehearsing in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and a couple dozen white - gathered to hear Greene's routine recap of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is Green's assistant coach.
He's been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader in the remake for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself", says Marbaugh.
 However, it is important that this aspect of history is also highlighted so that it never happens again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their lines.
The show begins with Malcolm screaming and pushing Hester, furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me, I said get off my land, you motherfucker!
Rascona, also known as Hester, is in charge.
And then the shot.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asks the Rascona.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
Greene is in a rage.
I just don't think the white people used the word "n" at the time.
So, another black actor confirms.
You have to use the longer version.
The subject of the play is unpleasant, but the room is full of friends.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the show, but to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene begins again.
Now Rascona's words are flying.
No one is laughing.
The resurgence will end quickly and violently.
There was shouting, shots fired, and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks with every second word.
A few hundred feet away, about 50 spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost exactly half black and half white.
There's a couple who came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They've been visiting the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia, under Brooks' guidance.
The murders have changed from a story to reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is very tense.
After the song, Greene calls the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The kids squat down to look at the fake blood and the immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
They're not really dead, the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will be thanking the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers take off their cloaks and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who impersonated the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"No worries", the woman who was in the show comforted me.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and the actors will gather for a communal dinner.
A white couple who have just arrived from the balcony are having a lively discussion about the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinsky has a hard time finding the words to describe the feelings that the show has created.
"It's hard to listen to the horrible things people say and do that look like you", she says. "It's because they look like you".
My performance made me realise that lynchings still happen, she added. They are just called arrests.
Across the room, Brooks recalls the civil rights movement to the audience at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Re-incarnation is a powerful experience, because it depicts the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience", says Brooks.
The message is that this could happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.
Hanging plants in shops is a boon: By removing this amount of "excess parts", you're actually saving money
Is it legal to remove the cauliflower leaves before weighing them?
How about taking the big hat part off the pineapple - that weighs what?
The answers are sharply divided: for some it is a sign of extreme poverty, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and that are thrown away at home.
It's a phenomenon that's recognized in the stores.
For example, in the vegetable section of the K-Citymarket in the Helsinki district of Ruoholahti, there are cardboard boxes, because many tear off, for example, the leaves of the flower trees.
The leaves are taken from the box to the store's bio-waste.
According to a news report published by the Economic Times, shopkeepers are puzzled by the smell of vegetable shelves.
But how much does removing the extra parts of the vegetables before weighing actually save money?
How significant is this sniffing noise really?
We women tested how the price changes when the pineapple, the artichoke, the sweet potato, the broccoli, and the cauliflower take their leaves or stems away.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower, which cost $1.10, became $1.80 after all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which cost 2.30 euros, dropped to 1.95 euros when its stalk was twisted off.
The Latvian art category: from EUR 2,60 to EUR 2,40 when the short position was broken off.
Two of them cost 75 cents.
Without the bag, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli was sold for 1 euro and without the stem for 80 cents.
The result: If you start to pick the leaves and stems, you will save at best a few inches on one hat.
In percentage terms, the price of the hat dropped by as much as 20 percent.
So, a total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved on these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French soccer club PSG, reports the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buyout to FC Barcelona, a Spanish football club playing in the Spanish league.
The transfer of €222 million is the biggest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league held off the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment made by Neymars representatives.
According to the league's rules, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by circulating the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his agents, who have delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
They're expecting him to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa is looking into the details.
In addition, Barcelona stated in its press release that it would provide information on the payment to UEFA in order to determine any disciplinary action that might be taken in the event.
Among others, the Spanish league president, Javier Tebas, has expressed doubts that PSG's financial practices violate UEFA's rules on financial fair play.
UEFA can fine a company that makes more than 30 million euros in losses in three years.
UEFA says that the transfer of Neymar does not automatically break its financial stability.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the finances of the club for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The club is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi, a Qatari ex-tennis player.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, was severely burned by a lightning strike, a flash captured on airport security cameras.
Austin Dunn was doing routine maintenance on a plane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly lightning struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The force of the lightning bolt knocked the plane's wing to the ground near Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother had a stroke and was in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the penitentiary.
In addition to the burn injuries, he suffered muscle damage and a cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a very difficult experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
The airport representative said that the system of warning of the danger of a secret attack was on at the time of the incident and that the transport company decided to follow it.
Pearson is cutting 3,000 jobs and reviving the business by cutting its dividend .
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72% as it embarks on a new structural programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly take place in late 2018 and early 2019; the company has already cut 4,000 jobs in previous restructurings.
Pearson announced further cost reductions of £300 million in May as part of its third savings programme, aimed at reviving a business that has been weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its interest in Penguin Random House to its partners Bertelsmann, who said they would keep their outlook for the year unchanged, with sales up by half a percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
A statement from NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabagh district.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, after Tuesday's blast at a mosque in Herat killed 30 people.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint NATO and Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "person carrying an improvised explosive device".
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the terrorist organisation ISIS in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, in a predominantly Shia Muslim area.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the deadliest attack by a militant group in the country since US-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether to send more U.S. troops to help the local military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly eroded people's trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses its decision to delay implementation of the smog rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has postponed the implementation of the Obama administration's emissions reduction measures, a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision late Wednesday to implement the 2015 so-called "salting" rule, which the agency said was a sign of its commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states", said Scott Pruitt, the agency's director, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to delay implementation of ozone regulations by one year to October 2018, which would allow the measurement of smog in specific parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mostly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, claiming that the delay was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking to ease environmental regulations from the Obama administration, which Trump says are part of a broader program of economic growth.
Trump's actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA's website, breathing air containing ozone "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
A senior ISIS figure was also believed to have sent the bomb's construction parts to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
It is suspected that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15th, but the attempt was aborted before the security check.
Police have not released any details as to why the company was shut down.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to produce a toxic, colorless gas and then take the device to a public place, such as a public transportation system, with a full charge.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plot was one of the most professional schemes ever devised in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police stations on Saturday for suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but he too is being interrogated.
The European Union is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.
Oil refiner Neste's profit before tax declined, but beat forecasts for the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company achieved a good result in the oil products business, sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level and the development of the operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was on the right track.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievos, the operating profit on renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even after the end of the tax incentive.
We're making good progress in our strategy.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discussing a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the most exciting boxing match in the near future, faced off for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their rooms at ESPN's Los Angeles headquarters when the undefeated WBC lightweight champion, Mikey Garcia, walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO heavyweight champion.
Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner by unanimous decision at the Showtime on Saturday, and since then, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been in the top five in the rankings of the world's most elite boxers.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?"
Good luck with the match!
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 on Saturday.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomatchenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a match between the men would be "perfect for the size".
"I am a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
I moved up the series for a Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small man for a 200-pound man.
I want to get back to the lightweight division.
He's got to get up to the lightweight division, then we can fight.
That's what our fans are hoping for.
Let's grant their wish.
Lomatchenko agreed with me.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the match should be organised by pay channel, part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, who will make his lightweight debut later this year and fight next summer against Garcia (37-0 with 30 knockouts).
"The fight could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it", Garcia said, later stating that he was willing to fight on the channel that offered the best reward package.
We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else is gonna get as much attention as you.
I'm fine with it as soon as we make a deal...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might go to the match on Saturday.
Lomatchenko interrupted his flow of praise to Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow".
Garcia said he focused on showing off his punch first, then boxing.
The men said they felt that the people wanted the match between them to be more and more intense.
This is the match we've been waiting for.
No other match has attracted as much attention and interest as this one.
I'm definitely in on this, Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he was looking forward to fighting the best.
It's gonna be a great game.
Average salary of $5,300, training, whatever. Investment counseling was a wild card.
The quality of investment advice has been a big issue lately.
The latest report from Helsingin Sanomat was by Ritva, 68, to whom an investment advisor from a shell-shopped bank told the full story when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new financial markets directive, which will be applicable from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the competence requirements.
The Financial Services Authority (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services take its own APV1 or APV2 examination.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of the examinations to a company called APV-investeringsutkinnot Oy, whose examination team includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degree courses are of 12-15 credits and are offered by Aalto EE, the provider of business management services, Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website says that, in general, both examinations are "quite broad in terms of requirements".
The course material includes 10 to 15 books and numerous other works and books.
The CEO of APV-investmentstudiekinnot Oy, Markku Savikko, says that the pass rate is roughly estimated at around 70%.
The staff of the largest banks, and virtually all investment service providers, have completed either the APV1 or APV2 qualifications, as these are compulsory under the companies' own rules.
The Commission is also considering the possibility of extending the scope of the new regulation to include the provision of information on the use of the euro.
He calls such banking operations "mutations".
According to Savik, since 2000 there have been 13 000 to 14 000 people who have completed the APV1 qualification and around 3 000 who have completed the more demanding APV2 qualification, which is recommended for investment advisers.
Some banking firms view graduation as an advantage.
A number of other sectors have much higher skill requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Finance Sector requires the completion of APV studies, because it is then that investment-related knowledge is ensured.
According to the Statistics Centre, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros a month in commissions, including in-kind and income bonuses.
The average monthly wage for regular hours is about EUR 5 300.
Men who work in factories earn on average more than EUR 5 900 a month, and women over EUR 4 500 a month.
The top 10 earn an average of around €8,100.
The top 10% of men earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, while the top 10% of women earn more than EUR 6 400 per month or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be given by a licensed company.
The level of self-regulation at the employee and job level has been relied upon until now.
According to FIVA, its audit revealed individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
It is also possible to act as a seller of investment products, even if one's professional skills and qualifications are at a reasonable level.
The situation has been wild and free in this respect.
The Commission is also working on a new strategy to improve the quality of the EU's food supply.
The Commission has also decided to extend the deadline for the submission of the draft legislative resolution to the Council.
This requires that each firm be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently qualified.
The FSA, on the other hand, will be empowered to determine what you need to know.
FIVA's market supervisor, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the regulation on the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
According to Hov, the new requirements apply both to the investment firms' own staff and to the agents selling products on behalf of a firm.
Hovi says that according to the government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the power to impose on knowledge and experience.
What they are, we'll decide on these views during the coming fall.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this must be documented and the company has a burden of proof that this has also been done.
The Court clarifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the staff's performance profiles at the individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or selling products.
According to Hov, another new requirement is to work with someone who has passed the deadline if the skills or experience are not at the right level.
This means that if a company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain period of time with the person who does.
Hov says that as the rules change, they become more rigorous and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: A 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "circled" a gigantic plane that was flying over the United States
The flight path was plotted by Flightradar24 over the United States.
The flight was made on Thursday on a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines for long-range durability.
The plane that left Seattle covered a distance of 9,000 miles (15,700 km) in 18 hours and 1 minute, longer than any regular commercial flight in operation in the world.
The flight remained inside the United States for the entire duration of the flight.
It flew through 17 states.
The tenacious coastal school children of Imra are not beaten by rain or sunshine - Iines All-Polish team tenaciously with the help of swimming pool
The younger girl was moving along at a good pace, Taina was following.
Imatra's rantauymama schools are in Liette and Lempuka this week and next.
Although it rains occasionally and then glows again, young swimmers are not very good swimmers, says Taina Itkonen, the head of swimming schools.
This week, 13 children will be swimming in the schools, and next week, dozens.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and the excursion start at that time, Itkonen estimates.
The school is organized by the Movement for the Unification of Education and the City of Imatra.
Thursday at the Liettee swimming pool was a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining, and young swimming school students were practicing how to stay afloat with swimming trunks, some even without.
The younger sisters also enjoyed the water.
The first thing I knew about going deeper was that the whole thing was a mistake.
But Taina Lament encouraged him to leap towards the shore.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me he went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the beach at Liette is good.
Like everyone else, I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swimming with the swimming club, and I practiced swim with the swimming club, and I practiced swim with the swimming club, and I practiced swim with the swimming club, and the swimming club, and the swimming club.
"You too can be happy with today's achievements", said the swimming monkey.
Jamilio, 4, still wanted to go swimming sometimes.
His daughter, Anna Villbergin, 6, who watched the swimming from the beach, believes that the beach school is a good place to start learning how to swim.
No matter what the weather, Anna has always loved coming here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school kids were packed on the dock.
The boys had a lot of work to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the dock, picked fruit and enjoyed the day.
The water was still teaching, but the dock was not.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
"Unknown soldier selling toilet rolls - "Here's a story that connects us"
You can see all kinds of things.
The blue-eyed blue-eyed blue-eyed blue cleaning products company launched a new line of products called the unknown soldier a few days ago.
I mean, dish brushes and laundry towels and "toilet brush with a brush on the edge".
The Unknown Soldier refers to the movie that's coming out this fall and the marketing of the movie.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been derided on social media: When will the Unknown Health Bands come?
I'm gonna have to call the company and find out what's going on.
What does the vice president of Sin Product say?
We're the partners in this movie.
We're supporting this film, like so many other endeavors.
We wanted to support a domestic production and a cult film, says Määttä.
He says the products will be customized for the stores, and the film will be seen.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often thinking that products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
There is a unifying story here, that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
He says the company upholds the same core Finnish values as he does, which are shared by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not unknown to military culture, Courage points out.
Other partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall wicks have been brought to market, and they are found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
The unknown products were already being claimed by the blogger Kalle Kinnunen of Suomen Kuvalehti
We've got coffee and watches.
Kunen is pleased to note that there's still time before the movie's premiere, so there's still time to do the sequel.
The unknown partner companies, which have not yet revealed their war products, include Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published.The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that over 80% of those tested were identified as being over 18 years of age.However, not all consider the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failing to determine the actual age of asylum seekers who claimed to be minors.
The Immigration Service has so far carried out 6 880 tests and the Office of Forensic Medicine has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the tested persons, 80% of the 2002 asylum seekers were identified as being over 18 years of age.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is possibly under 18 years of age.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age of the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Forensics Agency says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
'The figures are fairly consistent, there is no big difference from the previous months' statistics,' he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of applicants were identified as being over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the applicants had lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were 'references to the test being conducted on persons aged 18 or over'.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age-assessment method used in the tests involves x-rays of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans, which can help to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than normal.
I have had a good deal of time to think about this and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: 'In general, it can be said that the risk of assigning a child to an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in the case of a test subject who is about to turn 18, when the risk is about 10%.
The plane crashed 30 places in Scotland.
With five over pars in the third round, Mikko Ilosen took a 30-hole drop in the European Tour of Golf in Scotland.
The winner started from the 11th place, which was shared on Saturday, but was found at the end of the round, in the 41st place.
Iloselle was in a difficult situation, with three bogs and one double bog.
It was hard for everyone else.
The Englishman Ian Poulter came in second place with one lap to spare, although he said there was plenty of work to be done in the umbrella-holding.
"The road was rough, but I stuck with it, and in the end, it was a good day", Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his fellow countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of West Virginia is changing parties .
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he was switching parties.
"The Democrats simply rejected me", Justice said.
Today, after much prayer and careful consideration, I can tell you that I can no longer help you as the Democratic governor of West Virginia.
The audience erupted into a standing ovation.
"Tomorrow I'm going to register as a Republican", Justice added.
As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game.
Trump earlier promised that a major announcement would be made at a West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice didn't support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
In 2016, he was elected governor of California, and Forbes lists him as the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His net worth is approximately $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather build obstacles than a better America".
"With only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, the announcement by Justice is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message", RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
I 've been sowing the seeds of mischief Thursdays come and even the summer 's rainy day
By the end of the week, more thunderstorms will be reported in southern Finland.
During the past week, there has been a hailstorm, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Central Finland.
On the night of Wednesday to Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
The weatherman says Thursday could be the worst thunderstorm of the summer.
The eagle-eyed people have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been particularly bright in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
When it was over, a bolt of lightning struck the power plant in the row house, causing a small fire.
The fire department received a call about a quarter to two past midnight on Wednesday.
The power station was in a sauna at the end of the block.
The fire department demolished the roof and walls to find the fireplace and quickly put out the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but no personal injury was caused.
And then, in the twilight, lightning struck the outer building and set it ablaze on Harjul road before midnight.
When the fire department arrived, the building was already in full-blown flames and the fire department had no choice but to stop the fire from spreading.
The outbuilding, about one hundred and fifty square feet [50 sq m], burned to the ground.
In the direction of the pit, in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a private house.
The occupants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a blazing lightning strike.
The fire department went to check on the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses were burned.
In traffic, a lightning strike caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, damaging the traffic control system.
The failure was reported between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until just before five o'clock in the afternoon.
Since then, the railway has been able to continue its normal operation, even with the part of the track that is broken by lightning.
The Slammers have been wreaking havoc all over Finland.
However, the number of cases has been relatively small this summer.
"This summer's hail storms have been a total fluke", says Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist with the Meteorological Department.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the slight summer thunderstorm, many feel that they are even strong.
"This might seem like a really hard thunderstorm, but that's what it's been compared to the thunderstorms this summer", Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the number of landings was 1 700, and Thursday had the potential to be the worst day of the summer with the strongest thunderstorms: by about 4 p.m. the number of landings was 1 790 on the record.
If the lightning continues to strike until midnight, then more than two thousand lightning strikes may be possible, predicts Tuovinen.
The previous record was set in 2015 when the number of lightning strikes in a year was around 30 000.
By Wednesday this year's number of lightning had risen to 18,386.
So there is still work to be done to ensure that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the Ukkoskirin can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air over Finland remains warm and humid during the weekend, which is a suitable birth environment for the larvae.
The main bulb will move from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
A more unified front is in the offing in the center of the earth.
Tuovinen says that in such a place, thunder is rare.
Coe praises Russia 's "friendly" apology for the doping scandal
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been working together to ensure that the European Union's policies are consistent with the principles of the Treaty and the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Russia's athletics director general, Dmitri Shlyachin, told the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championships that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he would fight against doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who lost gold or silver medals in the Games".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban, which was lifted in November 2015 after a WADA report cited evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct, it was a very candid presentation", said IAAF President Coe to reporters.
The Council and the Congress were all pleased that the Russian Federation of General Sports had acknowledged that the country was going through a difficult period and that it would do everything possible to reorganise its activities.
The Commission also welcomed the fact that the EU had agreed to the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban", Coe said.
We'll have to do something in the next few months to get everyone back to normal.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London starting Friday, meeting the strict IAAF criteria.
IAAF task force director Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has many requirements to meet before its status can be restored.
Testing remains insufficient and the banned coaches are still free to operate, he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the lack of success of Tom of Finland.
Tom of Finland did not become the success that the filmmakers had hoped for, says Yle.
To be honest, I'm disappointed, but I'll admit that the film was produced by Helsinki Film's CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was released in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is a small sum compared to the film's budget of about five million euros.
I don't think it was a lottery win, but it's important now that investors get their money back.
If the movie had done better in their country, they would have gotten their money by now.
The Commission has already taken action to ensure that the EU's external borders are not affected by the EU's nuclear weapons.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymari's transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the use of funds by European football associations do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, in what is the most expensive transfer of any player in the history of football.
The possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, the European football governing body, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced the Financial Fair Play Rules in 2011, which require PSG to be able to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million for the termination of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
There are many financial aspects to Neymar's move to France.
PSG has no problem paying Neymar's transfer fee and adding him to their star guard, as the club is financing Qatar's oil-rich ruling family.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but these must be balanced with real sources of income in order to avoid a loss-making football business.
The economic rules of the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of the Frenchman Michel Platini, who was elected UEFA President in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that pursuing success by going into debt was a scam and would lead to serious problems if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the Fair Play Financial Rules shifted from the clubs' debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period for fair play financial rules runs until 2018, during which time clubs are allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA president in a scandal in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is also keen to curb the clubs' wasteful spending.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the economic rules of fair play at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can allocate the sum in the booking for the entire duration of his new contract.
The transfer of EUR 44,4 million over the next five years is therefore an annual expense.
The first sanctions were issued in 2014 based on the rules of fair play, with the largest sanctions being imposed on PSG and the Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million, later reduced to €20 million, and ordered to limit their squad to 21 players for the 2014/15 season, instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated to the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the support is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA does not count the support as an actual result.
The Commission also notes that the financial support for the club was provided by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Finance.
It has also been revealed that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be financed by the fees available from the Qatar 2022 World Cup Organising Committee.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to expose such an arrangement.
Due to the previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA is more than usual monitoring attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG for the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identities not be revealed, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any evidence to support the argument that the measures in question were necessary to restore the economic viability of the airport.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of tracking products and jerseys.
The company estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, claiming that it violated the rules of fair play.
'This is a clear case of economic doping, both by the club and the state,' the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
The European Union has also been criticised for its lack of a comprehensive approach to the issue of the right of the European Union to participate in the European Union.
'The case is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the way football operates over the last 15 years,' Wenger said on Thursday.
Anything is possible once the state owns the football team.
It becomes very difficult to follow the economic rules of fair play, because there are so many different interests involved in having a famous player represent the state.
Now it's rushed: the coach of the Finnish athletes in the World Cup is stuck in Helsinki
The coach of the long jump Arttu Pajulahti and the triple jump Kristiina Mäkelä, Suren Ghazaryan, is stuck in Helsinki, although she should be coaching the athletics at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump.
However, the coach of the duo, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa for Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British Embassy, to no avail.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but that hasn't been enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is the first sign of Brexit, or what, said head coach Jorma Kemppainen.
He's always handled visa matters himself successfully in the past, but now there's some trouble.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone in the stadium is looking at the footprints, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about possible absenteeism.
A World Cup medal for Finland from London is a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London this Friday and will run for a week ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench players can passionately approach from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of the junior athletes, success is measured in medals.
There are other metrics.
Less noted are the beautiful stories of young athletes growing from one championship to another, where experience is used to mature the athlete's performance to the level that a World Cup medal for adults is truly possible.
Now, in the small Finnish World Cup team, there are no such young athletes, and certainly no concreet ones.
A World Cup medal for Finland is a miracle.
Fortunately, the excitement and the surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench-top athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the games, even though the medals in London are not decided until late at night because of the time difference.
At the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the javelin thrower, Tero Long.
The Uska fans are still waiting for a medal from Pitka, although the other is the result of his recent results and the other pitchers, as well as Pitka's final finish in the last summer's championships.
No matter what happened in these games, Tall Man will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, entering the final competition or setting a personal record is a good enough performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal-winning potential of Finnish sports in the years to come will be given by the success of the international youth championships this summer.
The development of young talents and the financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite team of representative sportsmen.
Success does not come overnight but requires years of hard work on the part of athletes and patience on the part of both coaches and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope the London Olympics will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, say, terrorism or the fear of a vicious attack.
♪ I'm the second guy in Copper's big air ♪ ♪ But it hurts ♪
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the Big Air race in Colorado, USA.
The runner-up at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best in the Big Air World Cup.
The women's race was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He attempted his last jump, the first ever in the sport, at a caballerial 1080 and came very close to succeeding.
I feel good and I feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite.
I'm going to try again in the races from now on, said Rukajärvi.
In the big air snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the event.
The new high-speed Viking Line ship has arrived in Helsinki
The new Viking high-speed ferry, the FSTR, is seriously behind schedule.
The express train was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 18:00.
The ship was loading in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've been waiting for at least an hour and a half for you to get on the boat.
The convoy is now moving a little, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board a ship in the port of Helsinki, at 7.30 pm.
Rebane thought the new ship had a technical glitch.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles for those waiting in their cars to board the ship.
Viking's communications director Christa Grönlund told IS that the fire was caused by a technical error.
It was fixed at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will be delayed a couple of hours on its return to Tallinn.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 8:15.
A 42-meter special transport is disrupting traffic on the Kuutostoi on Thursday night.
A 42-meter special transport will be moving from Muuk to the port of Mustolan on Thursday evening.
The 9:00 transport should be there by 1:00 p.m.
Police are directing traffic on the Sixth Street, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From Mälkök, the transportation will continue along route 13 to the port of Mustöla.
A little nostalgia for the circle of wet hot American summer and comrade detective .
The story simultaneously reflects both the glory days of the characters in the 1980s and the grunge of the 1990s (when David Wain and Michael Showalter created the brilliant sketch series The State for MTV) and its own time in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the constant reminder that we're stuck in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's out of date.
First Day of Camp did surprisingly well, and not just for its absurd humor (it was, among other things, told as a backstory to a vegetable bouquet with H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The point of the joke is that the middle-aged actors are playing the part of the teenage girls who are approaching puberty and are all hot and craving, and to emphasize that makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotionally charged and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, stalker cartoons from the 1990s, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up the Apple Powerbook, inline skateboards and "some other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but he still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still a virgin.
And in one crazy plot, Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) is partnered with George H. W. Bush (aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this kind of series, the best part is the side bars.
And it's especially fun to see the teenager Paul Rudd, who has a beard on his lower lip, the Matt Dillon "soul patch" from the movie Singles, and Andy, the camp king, played by Rudd, is turning into an old man.
Random moments of madness may propel the series as a sort of recurring Seven Up! series, until it gets its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer  Twenty Years Later.
Comrade Detective on Amazon, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW button image, where East meets West.
The comedy series, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, is a Romanian 1980s police drama about a pair of Bucharest cops fighting for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The series stars Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici as the tough-minded Gregori and the idealistic Iosefina, with their voices dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the series' executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
It's a lot, but it's not much.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the cops spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There's a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, and their bonging makes for a really fun game.
Comrade Detective, however, gets too caught up in the clumsy socialist drama of the serial, with a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example, and so the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or rich enough.
A condensed series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef frequent the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby gobbling up hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make anything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we gobbled up our own local history and their history.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will take to the ring in Macau on Saturday against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru will face a tough opponent in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt in jujutsu and is the world champion of the sport.
For once, I'm going to fight my own father.
It's a funny story, says 32-year-old Tauru.
The Kouvo man was scheduled to take the stage in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three wrestlers were rushed to the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
Tauru has never encountered anything like this before.
This is the first time I've ever had a fight canceled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
But the wrestler is pleased that the fight has been rescheduled.
A week's waiting doesn't really affect the preparation.
The transfer won't affect your condition, because it won't improve in a week.
You know, if you train too much, you can actually get worse.
In his previous few fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in vertical fighting.
This time it's different.
The Kouvo resident describes Issa as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter, you know.
I bet he'll come in in the first round and try to take it to the mat.
He's won the jujutsu world championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last game of the Kouvola did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines hit Tauru hard in the corner of his eye, and the Philippines won.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up. He didn't get a hit.
When I was about to fall, he hit me in the eye.
It hurt for a really long time.
A New Motivation to Do the Work
Some of the freestyle wrestlers fight once a year, some of them get in the ring more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
The board, on the other hand, had three fights last year.
Now we have the second fight of the year.
I've had a few rough patches.
I've been training for the last few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old learned of the impending encounter, he decided to change his mind for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the joy of doing things back.
We had some really good practice with a guy from Sweden.
The practice was a great help, for on Saturday the kouvo student will have to prepare for a physical contest.
I've had the opportunity to train against my own size and practice some of the more advanced forms of combat.
Fighting in the face is the 32-year-old's primary tactic.
You gotta hit it smart.
If there's any chance, I'll go and take it to the estate myself.
You can't give out free samples because they're the most expensive.
Macao is attracting Tauru, who has fought in China before.
I hear it's like Las Vegas in China.
I think we're in for a big, beautiful night.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged, as economic growth has been sluggish and the easing of inflation has put an end to speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, and it has moved interest rates as household incomes are under increasing pressure.
The decision makers of the central bank's monetary policy committee voted 62 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, but this month's support for interest rates has been weaker because of the lack of growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the level of household income would be under further pressure as inflation was expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
The Bank also noted that the cost of borrowing could be higher than expected in the financial markets, and that the Bank's policy of maintaining a high level of borrowing costs would be in line with the Bank's policy of maintaining a high level of borrowing costs.
In addition, the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that was launched a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide an additional GBP 15 million of preferential funding to banks through the Scheme, for a total of GBP 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision minutes state: The Monetary Policy Committee forecasts that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the decline in real household income reduces consumption.
On the interest rate side, the Bank reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' and 'a broader appreciation of market expectations' were needed to contain inflation.
The market currently forecasts a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases are gradual and regional.
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9% this year and 1.7% next year.
It now set its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The pound lost 0.5% against the dollar to $1.31, and 0.4% against the euro to $1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth figures were dampened by increased expectations of interest rates, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review offered little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the bank said the situation would get worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy could not prevent a decline in income in the coming years, but it expected wage developments to recover significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset part of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% following the shock EU referendum result, which sent the pound plummeting.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the Decision is likely to be felt in terms of prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, the demand for rate hikes had become increasingly vocal as inflation increased pressure on households.
The Bank of England has said that the inflation rate has fallen to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, but that this was expected and that inflation will pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun of its 2% target was due to a weak pound as a whole.
Given the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market looks set to intensify further as lenders seek out clients and want to end the year strongly, says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
 The market is particularly attractive to those whose current loan contracts are about to expire.  Repayment contracts are more popular, with low interest rates and with no-cost options. 
The NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a 'non-reversible' anti-HIV drug.The High Court settled a dispute over the funding of the drug in the English NHS.
The NHS reported that PrEP will be given to about 10,000 people in the first three-year trial, and the pre-coital drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that said the NHS could pay for PrEP, even though it argued that local authorities should pay for it.
The decision announced on Thursday was called by NHS England's director, Simon Stevens, 'a significant new intervention' and described by the National AIDS Foundation as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept applications for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October and reach full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a pre-coital HIV medication that reduces the risk of infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in at-risk groups.
Taking medicines before sex means that there are enough medicines in your body during sex to prevent HIV infection.
You can take it every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target population for treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics will select eligible applicants from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered with a GP can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and the NHS in England signed a contract to buy the drugs this week after an international tender.
The aim of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, use and treatment delivery.
'This major new intervention should complement and strengthen the already existing multifaceted and increasingly effective HIV prevention tools', says Stevens.
 Another milestone in a fight that has lasted for more than 30 years to tackle one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity.
"This is a defining moment in the fight against HIV", says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Foundation.
 PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and to those in high-risk groups, could have a transformative impact on the UK HIV epidemic.
From September, those at risk will be given a drug, through an NHS-funded trial, that they can decide to take without consulting their partner, and that has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of many, many people.
This was welcome news.
"What's most important now is to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the high-risk group is left out", says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The experimental PrEP drug has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 at-risk people from HIV infection.
The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was unnecessarily delayed for several months due to government delays, says Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
We have evidence that the drug could have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us to understand even better the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are at risk of HIV and get one step closer to a situation where we have succeeded in stopping the spread of HIV in society.
Quality of life: The mezzanine and clever interior design have turned the small Earl's Court apartment into a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh, who was keen on renovating her properties, moved from the suburb of Knightsbridge to a smaller flat in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anne-era style house, and the success of Remont is evidenced by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her bags and moved in.
'Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge,' Joanne says.
I was looking for something similar in my price range.
I was here at the apartment show and I noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at that time.
I was immediately impressed and made an offer the same day.
Since then, the approximately 90 square-foot apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double, with the bedroom only accessible from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and a secondary floor to take advantage of the furniture.
I wanted space, big windows, lots of light.
They were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Notting Hill-based design firm Duck & Shed to take advantage of the space of the nearly four-metre-high rooms and create a flat that would not just be a place to renovate and sell, but a home.
The furniture was not quite enough for two rooms, so the challenge was to build a middle floor that could be stood on.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
Steel structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be stacked so that you didn't have to squat in them.
The structures had to be adjusted to the correct height both above and below.
Erfan was able to stack two full-height rooms with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, the Retrouvius's copper-plate window opens into a stylish living room.
The mirror-colored furniture, the silverware and the vintage lamps by Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
The mirrors at each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem farther than it really is.
The mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens onto another room.
The mirror-covered furniture in the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
The kitchen is a little more stylish because it can be hidden when not in use.
The use of a folding door for the kitchen is not a new concept.
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised up the same way as the garage door.
'It took a little planning', says Erfan about the steel-reinforced MDF cut-out door.
 It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifted.
With careful use of space and storage, Joanne had 16 extra square feet, a second bedroom, and a better floor plan.
When selling a house, the area is what counts or the property's value , says Erfan.
In the case of a real estate agent, he walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area.
The floor area of Joanne's apartment was increased by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
The inhabitant is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the feeling of belonging to the dwelling is partly based on them, says Erfan.
Nobody's gonna get attached to power lines on the wall.
They're important too, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additions can make a basic residence exceptionally fine.
Then, too, you may not want to move out of your apartment.
The pregnant Princess Sofia was glowing in her summer dress .
Princess Sophia's dress choice was a good one.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a fleece-coloured, light blue dress.
Sofia was represented at the event with a smile on her face.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad, Sweden, this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue full-length costume that was beautifully designed for the recently pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark-blue suit.
This is the last representative event Sofia will ever represent before she gives birth.
His due date is September.
For the dinner party, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel-blue dress that fit her beautifully.
The crown of style is the big earrings and the stylish little necklace.
The pastel dress was a fine princess.
Sofia has been in Sweden this week on a mission to Båstad.
Sofia filled her outfit with a little something.
Sofia was glowing with her fresh summer look.
Sofia was so into the event, she even talked to the photographers.
"Now I just hold my stomach", Sofia said with a laugh, "and she pointed to the end of her trunk".
She raises us with sweet chilli
In the summer of 1996, Lahore saw the arrival of a restaurant selling Thai food.
The people of Lahti didn't dare to taste it, they just walked by.
In the hut, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttil, known among the Panja.
He knew little Finnish, and the Finns at that time did not yet know Thai.
Since the people were afraid to eat, Panja offered free snacks.
Thus he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, one spring meal at a time.
"Taste it", he said.
I got caught up in the lazy.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Lahti shopping mall.
It had two small tables, less than 20 customers, I think.
He taught us not only how to eat Thai food, but also how to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and limited, you can't leave an empty chair between you and a stranger.
And then we got to know each other a little bit and we became friends.
Finally, I sat down at the table with a dictionary and studied Thai.
It took two years to get the grocery store, but then the restaurant had to be moved because they said the homemade pasta smelled too bad in the hall.
There's a new seat opening up at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we judges can sit at our own tables again, only at the most crowded times we are embarrassed to ask our guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his customers.
He's told all about where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food each of us eats.
He's seen how the clients' life stages change and the food choices change.
She remembers the name of the man I went to dinner with for my first spring rolls.
She remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers me as a young man.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own seat by the kitchen door and exchange belongings with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food isn't the most important thing we get from him.
He's taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili pepper.
He has opened not only our taste buds but also our minds and hearts.
Today, many speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire the Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's a hard worker.
He's got a restaurant business, and he's always on mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of being a carpet.
We had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or notice, this remarkable day passed, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike Europe
The security authorities received a list of items of significance for counter-terrorism work at the beginning of the year.
The list contains information on over 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to invade Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 persons in all, and the document contains not only their personal details but also photographs of each one.
More than 130 of the persons listed are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The Evening News told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi Army Special Forces discovered a list of terrorists' personal details and photos while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence community evaluated the documents for authenticity and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all the security authorities in the European countries in May.
The fear was that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the individuals, but also their birth dates, their invented aliases, and information about their country of origin.
The list also identifies the terrorist's areas of expertise.
For example, the name Sami J., a 27-year-old German man on the list, is Abu Assid al-Almani, which means German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
There's a suicide bomber inscription next to his picture.
The man's fate is not known.
In total, some 6,000 fighters have left Europe for ISIS, and their fate is uncertain.

The person was delivered to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a man in his 50s.
The interviews were all about him wanting to show he could swim.
The situation in Tok'in Shore is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Patrol and the police.
It was a Border Patrol-led mission.
The people on the scene also provided excellent instruction to the divers.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water, along with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two cars collided in Eurasia, nine people in the cars, three seriously injured
A total of nine people were in the cars, and the rest suffered minor injuries, says the fire chief on duty.
The injured include both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the afternoon.

According to the emergency services, the speed limit is 50 miles an hour at the intersection.
The brothers are fighting over $ 500 million in real estate .
Two brothers are fighting over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million, and the dispute is linked to a family business founded by their Italian ancestor 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Club chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak estate, just three blocks from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the decision has been hotly contested.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, jointly own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate wealth when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family started Westco Jeans, which grew to become a chain of 160 stores.
The chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the asset allocation means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns properties worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the division of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate for himself in his proposal", Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also fighting over who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has locked him out of the business.
Colin says that the allegation is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to get to the bottom of the case.
"In keeping with our Italian tradition, family is the most important thing to me", Colin said in his statement.
The cost of the case is mounting steadily, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports, and with consulting firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers, investigating the case.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who started dairy bars and deli stores in the late 1950s.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of property in Collingwood, where Colin established the family's first black market.
Colin says he started the shop in the last few years when Paul was still a kid (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass the property on to their sons in a convenient way.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court", Anna wrote in her statement.
The other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group, and Colin says Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are very unhappy about the financial implications of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former member of the board of the Australian Football League and best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He said in his text that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family name to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court, saying that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
'Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this,' Colin went on, saying that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
Friday, it seemed like all hope was gone.
'Our case will be settled in court in the near future', wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff is going to restrict the president's access to the media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First one.
According to Poltico magazine, the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict President Trump's media use and news coverage to keep him from getting into trouble as often as he does.
As reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
 When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with the senior staff on his first day on the job, he addressed the central problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House staff that all information - both printed and heard at press conferences - must go through him because the president makes better decisions when he has good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media access and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, he wanted to show that the sympathetic media was handling things more equitably", Sam Nunberg, who served as an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say it is essential to Trump's Twitter use to manage his personal media flow with a steady stream of praise".
I got it.
But it's ridiculous to suggest that Trump's use of Twitter would have ever been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know  maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more outrageous without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what messages Trump left undelivered.
If his staff have been able to stop him from causing trouble even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from making a fuss.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House trying to make their case by giving Trump information that supports their view, and that information may or may not be trustworthy.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers were deliberately giving the president questionable information.
Shane Goldmacher , a journalist , told of one case:
Trump's current and former employees say he can get extremely angry at articles criticizing him  especially if they talk about harmful leaks.
That's what happened in late February when someone sneakily gave the president a copy of a story on GotNews.com, a website founded by cyber-provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously made false accusations and later retracted them, and had not provided any concrete evidence.
And yet, after reading the story, Trump had begun to question the staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to put in place a system to manage documents going to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try again three months later.
He may prove more effective as a leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his aides are still running their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission extremely difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buyout price to FC Barcelona, a Spanish football league club.
The contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to Paris club PSG.
The huge transfer of 222 million euros is the biggest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, which paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The club is chaired by former tennis champion Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
We believe that Neymar will arrive in Paris on Friday.
Bestselling author Raija Oranen has overcome alcoholism and flight sickness with hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
Raija Oranen, the famous best-selling author of the TV series The Time of the Rose and The Clean White Sheets, has just celebrated her 69th birthday.
It was her hypnosis that helped Raija Orasta.
Five grandchildren keep their grandmothers so busy with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now, in the spring, they've also lost their rental.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which she has since overcome.
The outside of the body is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to drop when they stopped taking the serotonin medication, they were mood-altering drugs.
I used to get help with my alcoholism from hypnosis, which also helped with my fear of flying, and I got over it.
I've been sober for 15 years now.
Alcohol kills you, the brilliant writer says candidly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling the same route for over 45 years.
I'm better than I've ever been.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been traveling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was to be married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughing at her wife.
Oranen is remembered only for the 44-episode Clean White Sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I decided to make the Raikka family business a clothing company after reading Liisa Seppälä's 50-year-old memoir on the plane.
I was a seamstress' daughter, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes worked as a model, Oranen recalls.
He believes that the plot and the story of the series changed the Finns' attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelaisen's research and argument has revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen is a writer with many scripts to work on - hundreds of ideas.
The tourists returned to the alley of the millionaires.
Once again, the wealthiest landowners in the West Midlands are in a state of shock and awe at the stubborn vagrants who managed to cross the well dug by the council and return to the fields next to their homes.
The tourists park their two dozen caravans near the street known as Millionaire's Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The bystanders were able to cross the barrier at a point left unprotected by the path.
Angry residents have blamed Solihull City for its complete inability to solve the problem.
A resident who wishes to remain anonymous says that the perverts came on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing rocks at passers-by.
 The government must be forced to act because it seems to be totally incapable of solving the problem.
The rovers were here in May, then they left, but they came back.
More came in tonight, and probably more today.
A resident told me that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay the municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it.
Another resident, who asked not to be named, said it was ridiculous that the pilgrims returned so soon after being driven away.
They're more than ever, and they've even put a horse to graze in the park.
A Solihull City spokesman said the city is aware of illegal encampment near Streetsbrook Road. "We are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal action to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is essential for the collection of evidence that as many local people as possible report disruptive or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to establish a general picture of the situation for the purposes of the proceedings.
Angry mobs surrounded the Portuguese crash plane
Men who had made a forced landing on a crowded beach in Portugal were questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the force drop.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with causing death.
The maximum penalty for this is 16 years in prison in Portugal.
The small plane the men were flying had to make an emergency landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, yesterday because of a technical malfunction.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran away from the landing aircraft and into the water.
A 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl were killed instantly when the plane landed.
The plane hit the man with his back to the plane first.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, to Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not harmed.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and started beating the back of it, according to Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The guy called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a wonder more people didn't die.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
Finnish star who tragically lost his leg again won gold at World Championship: "Without the accident I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Cup gold in banked slalom in the Big White race in Canada.
Big Hammer had also won the World Cross Country Gold earlier in the race.
In all, there have been three World Cup titles.
What a World Cup this is!
Twice the gold was struck, with a fairly good heartbeat, the phone reached the Great Hammer rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Big Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing.
The whole parasailing industry has grown and evolved so much lately.
The gaps are narrowing, and there are a lot of new accountants.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming from the back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Big Hamari lost his other leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had eagerly calculated from a young age with his friends, and the accident had not made him want to get to the slope.
I mean, every once in a while, I think about what my life would be like if it hadn't been for that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's pointless to argue.
The cards are played, and the ones that are dealt are the ones that Big Hammer is playing.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and Big Hammer doesn't do that.
But he turned a terrible difficulty into an advantage.
I'd say that was a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion if it wasn't for the accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Big Hamari's biggest boarding party was already on the way.
The duuni to the summit was really only started after the accident.
I used to train with the guys when I was young, and we used to get excited and play the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the X-Games start.
I never would have imagined it.
I was 23 years old, and I thought, "This is going to be a really long life if I stay here and be bitter and miserable".
I decided to put on my sweaters and get to work.
I'd say I've had a pretty good run.
The skier was very pleased with the choice of the wheelchair-riding Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received her award at a sports gala in January.
According to Big Hammer, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the Para-athletic team.
It was a really big deal, and it was definitely a well-earned victory.
This will also open the eyes of the para-sports world.
When is it time to launch the athlete of the year campaign for two-time world champion Matt the Big Hammer?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hammer has not yet conquered all the peaks it covets.
Next year, I have a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We'll go and get the medal!
Most Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that ending the war in Syria and getting ISIS out of the country are the most important things that should happen for them to be able to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration doesn't see this as a change in the Syrian conflict.
The network of communication agencies Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 years, half of whom were women and half men, responded to the survey.
Half of the interviews were done in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently to their homeland in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents are able to imagine returning to their home country and four per cent were unable to say.
The study found that the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country are the main factors influencing young people's decision to return home.
Almost half (47%) say the end of the war is the most important factor in their permanent return home, while a quarter say the most important factor is the departure of ISIS.
Only less than 10% of respondents cited an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor was the most important for ending the conflict.
The majority of the population believes that ending the war is more important than removing President Bashar al-Assad from power.
A fourth-party group says the Assad presidency is an obstacle to a peace deal.
Almost half of them feel that political as well as military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Only a quarter of the population believes that military action alone will solve the conflict.
A majority of young Syrian refugees see ISIS as having lost power over the past year, while a fifth see it as having gained power.
The most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to convey to people the information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many put military action and education reform as the first priority.
The fair tenth thinks that the most important thing is to create jobs for young people with better pay.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under Trump.
Almost a quarter of Americans believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web organized -- the database he developed is used by companies like Wikipedia and Google.
MariaDB, a company from Espoo, is developing the 'fastest growing' open source database in the world.
MariaDB's flagship product, created by coding entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users nothing and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
Databases help to keep vast amounts of information organized and quickly accessible.
If you use, for example, LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in the form of images comes from the database, and images are linked to it", explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the chief technology officer at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
The man who works remotely from a diner is helping to make sure the Internet is running smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with a Swede named David Axmark.
In 2008, tech giant Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle overtook Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle acquisition happened, a lot of the MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work with Oracle, which didn't give a firm promise about the future of MySQL", Widenius recalls.
By this time, he had already started a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired a couple of dozen of Sun's best developers, and I made sure that the continuity of the code was maintained by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch of it.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was created to oversee the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"In the days of MySQL, these checks were not done", Widenius lamented.
Although many people have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar acquisition of MySQL, few people in Finland know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year", says MariaDB's Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Paqvalén.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet profitable, and Paqvalén is a minority shareholder.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which corporate customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can take more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL to MariaDB is a snap, because they're versions of each other.
MariaDB's paying customers include the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically distributed to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections with the biggest players in the game.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks", lists Paqvalén.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed data bases.
Oracle also has a modest side business with MySQL compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, according to the research company Gartner, players like MariaDB are still insignificant in terms of turnover, although they are fast-growing synths.
In a database market of about 50 billion dollars, open source databases are not even a billion.
But the value of open source cannot be measured in money alone, because most users pay nothing for these software products.
Gartner predicts that by 2018, enterprises will be building more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would have been converted to open access at that time or at least the transition would have started.
The big companies can't get new customers because most of them are going to go with open source next.
This has led to skyrocketing licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they did before with fewer customers", Widenius reflects.
As it is difficult to change the closed database, most of the customer companies have absorbed the price increases deliberately.
"There are a lot of customers who have a really hard time moving because their old apps and others are locked in a closed database", Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer base is about to fill up.
As the license fees increase every year, sooner or later the client will move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% lower than before, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they want.
In addition, many companies are already facing major system changes when they move to cloud services.
At the same time, many are switching between the database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the EIB, the European Investment Bank.
It was the largest EIB growth loan ever granted to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector clients in countries such as the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros every year for data storage.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
Widenius is upset by the way that money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the customer is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some people say open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot imagine or do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source developers, alongside another Finn, Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux.
Widenius helps other companies develop business models that work on open source.
I still give four or five talks a year around the world on this subject.
Italy toughenes its stance on NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on Mediterranean ships that they cannot continue their work unless they commit themselves to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
'If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate,' said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
The Minister's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German charity Jugend Rettet, whose crew were suspected of collaborating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal immigration.
The charity, which has been in operation for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges brought against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"We are and will continue to be focused on saving lives, and we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue area at this time", the organisation said in a statement on social media.
We can only assess the allegations after we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet's ship, the Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees on board the vessel directly from the traffickers, who then re-commissioned the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document that has been published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, who oversee rescue operations in the area, and are believed to be motivated by a passion for helping.
The code of conduct states that ships like the Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to monitor the activity.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and MOAS in Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain,
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the Baltic Sea region, which was adopted by the Council on 14 March.
Among those who have refused to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
The Commissioner said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy had fallen sharply in recent weeks as a result of the rescue operations, which he considered to be evidence that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and the cooperation with local mayors were beginning to bear fruit.
'In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel', the Minister said.
He revealed that he planned to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of killing his half-brother in Enon's work, the suspect was found in the countryside - case to the prosecutor
The alleged crime occurred in Enontekiyo Kuttas last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish woman in a drive-by shooting.
It's been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police also said that the suspect fled with two dogs to the countryside.
The man was found frozen in the countryside, and he didn't resist arrest.
The charges against you must be filed within a week.
The case may be heard in the Lapland Court of Appeal in August.
Robert Hardy, the actor best known for his roles in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and My Friends with All My Hair, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also acted in films and on television.
Hardy is best remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffe in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the television series My All-Fashioned Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed over a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texting people to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and calling her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June, and her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken", Conrad's father said at the hearing Thursday.
"My son was my best friend".
Carter appealed, and he was granted bail pending the appeal.
He faced 20 years in prison, but according to his attorneys, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Wearing red pants and a cream-colored sweater, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed and his tearful eyes fixed on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
He decided to end Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not accepted responsibility for the act, the prosecutor continued.
He has shown no remorse.
Carter's lawyer says the case was the result of shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's age, maturity, or even mental health problems did not have a significant impact on his actions.
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that she would not let a day pass without me grieving the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all of this, and I'm going to do my best to comfort her sister in this pain that we're going to carry forever.
Conrad's sister Camryn Roy told the court that she was tormented by the thought of never being able to see her brother's wedding and never being an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who has been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never goes away", Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, for the state of Massachusetts has no law that criminalizes the incitement of suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 from a car crash.
The case gained national attention when it was revealed that Carter had encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting him.
"Hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways", Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy in the two weeks before his death, when Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad", and "You just have to turn on the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter had drawn attention to Roy's death, and the judge ruled that Carter could not profit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter, including Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, but was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an op-ed by Knox, in which he states: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison".
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia are the worst since the Cold War
The EU is also committed to the protection of the rights of all citizens, including those who are not citizens of the EU.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it's fair to say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work towards closer cooperation with Russia.
He has also been responsible for the 'Crimean crisis' in Crimea, which has led to the 'de-escalation' of the situation in Crimea.
The EU is also committed to the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment from harmful substances.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had already said that the US-Russia relationship had reached a dangerously bad stage.
Trump said the two countries should thank the bad congressional relations that passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to the backlash experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW boss said the company believed there were more sensible alternatives to driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it was making changes to more than three million Mercedes-Benz engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned a recall.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions-neutralising equipment is increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely watched, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being a big-time patron of the big car companies and of ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which installed fake devices in its cars that reduced emissions to comply with regulations in the tests, and in normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but the actions of the executives are under scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, and therefore, he can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which authorities suspected had installed a system to circumvent European emissions standards, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
The Venezuelan vote has been the subject of a fraud investigation, with large demonstrations expected
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the outcome of the election, the chairman of the national electoral commission, Tibisay Lucenan, told reporters.
Maduro is convinced the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a controversial vote on Sunday elected a new parliament to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own protests so they will be underway at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night, local time.
The troops are to ensure the security of the nomination.
The lavender of Provence is threatened by climate change
The lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender was in decline because of drought and insect-borne diseases, and scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution.
'The Lavant is a region in danger in Provence, because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, which has led to a significant decrease in spring and especially autumn rainfall', says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM, a research institute in Provence specialising in agriculture.
This will shorten the life of the valve.
In addition, the drought has brought many small streams to the area, which spread micro-organisms.
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of tall stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are underdeveloped or weakened or missing altogether", says Chaisse.
In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts containing essential oils.
The solution is to increase irrigation, slow the loss of moisture in the soil, spray the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and develop more drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist is a reflection of the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how it is handling the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug wars in the Sinaloa province.
But today, we're going to talk about security because of a recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them to the newsroom where a grenade attack took place in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking reporters for names in each group, no evidence needed, just observation and feeling.
The board is inscribed with the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being paid by the government or the drug cartels, criminals who make the chaos in Mexico a deadly news story.
The violence is relentless, and journalists are increasingly the target of attacks. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened are under federal protection.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and inspiration of Riodoz.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez co-wrote many of her books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodez building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing his middle finger. The picture reads: "Rightness". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts with Valdez's smiling faces on them. Valdez wears glasses and a trademark Panama hat.
The meeting, less than two months after Valdez's death, will bring journalists together to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was created specifically to handle cases involving journalists, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists rarely go to trial, and of the thousands of murders per year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, only a few go to trial.
Riodoce journalists are determined to continue reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, despite the devastation and the increasing danger.
Ibarra says the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
'This meeting is a waste of time, to put it bluntly', he says.
We can't trust anyone until we know what's behind it.
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had been driving his red Toyota for only a couple of blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off with Valdez's car and crashed it a few miles away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors travel fast and freely in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a little bit of a nightmare.
Sinaloa has been Mexico's bloodiest battleground since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, with rival factions eager to fill the void.
On the streets of the Sinai, one or more people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has the ornate two-story tombs of drug lords that are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls the ports and drug routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoc, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of a rival faction waging war against Guzman's sons.
The story may have angered Guzman's boys: Suspected gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it was released.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to start Riodoce with five colleagues, whose shares were sold at $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem, Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-hitting investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists for her courage in following the story of the Mexican drug trade without waking up.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life", she said when she received the prize from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
"Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
The reporter must accept the task at hand or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was bathing here. Why didn't I tell you what was going on?
The Riodoce staff miss Valdezia, the joker who cursed like a harbor worker, they miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, they miss a teacher who knew how to get through life.
They trusted his routines.
He always wore a panama hat.
He used to go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the main office and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if routine was his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to consider how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
Criminals don't like it when we talk about their wives and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trafficking.
They were left out of the case, Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trusting your instincts.
If you feel that something isn't quite right, you should stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that 'impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case'.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where the Riodoce security training was held, and a few days earlier it had been revealed that only government-sold surveillance software had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree in the 40 degree heat.
They were assigned by the state government to guard the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class district of Culiacán.
Some reporters were half-jokingly speculating whether these two officers were among the 50 percent whom the state governor considered unreliable.
Months had passed since the reporters had visited the mountainous countryside ruled by the drug gangs.
For this week's issue, the Riodoce newsletter outlined three main stories.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in the Sinaloa.
The newspaper also revealed that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the district attorney's office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to proceed with caution: everyone in the town knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to report on previous incidents in the same area, one of which saw the son of El Chapo Guzman escape and avoid a military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column was a reliable source of information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened a long time ago", says Villarreal, 46, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" (the slender one) because of his thin build.
Now all connections to our data sources are cut off.
The Valdez office has been converted into a warehouse for the storage of anti-persecution signs and stickers for journalists, and the staff of the newspaper has been given a new, unexpected task: to become activists for freedom of the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a reporter, took some signs with her when she left the next morning for a protest in front of the local prosecutor's office, which was triggered by the murder of another journalist.
Salvador Adame went missing in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, according to DNA tests done by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest louder all over the country, with 'SOS Press' signs appearing on the sidewalks and buildings of protest sites.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he's trying to gain international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government-related matters, concerned that he is incapable of being objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organized crime, authorities that allow crime, and a careless society.
In his latest book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that journalists are killed by drug gangs, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
According to the Article 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were instigated by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing", says Ramirez.
Murk has a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Next to his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my writings".
Next to his severed head were a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close their operations, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, like Nuevo Laredo El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the front page of Diario de Ciudad Juarez carried a message to the drug cartels: What do you want from us?
Some of the reporters have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on your toes all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four other women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after he fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra  who once was destined to be a poet  admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is going to hell", he says.
Some time ago, on a Friday at midnight, Riodoke's reporters were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when the latest issue of the magazine was finished, and suddenly their phones began to ring in the message.
In a shootout between rival gangs and security forces in the beach resort of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters uploaded the news to the Riodoc website on their smartphones from the sidewalk.
The front page was supposed to be replaced the next day.
Sirens are blaring nearby. Another shooting incident.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the legacy of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man pointing the middle finger at the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting. How could I stop the newspaper when our intern asked to go out on the street to do a story on the very day Javier was murdered?
The Olympic project of Hannes Mannis began with a huge setback - "The Hard Place"
In April, Hannu Mannis' 39th birthday celebration was cut short as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
But the training season started disastrously when Manninen got the flu.
This began a long illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May was spent practically all sick.
First, there was the flu, and then there was a childhood illness, like an ear infection, which I had to take in a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten percent of the exercises that I had planned.
I can't remember the last time I was sick for this long.
It was a tough time when I couldn't take advantage of the training session, Manninen tells Night-Snow.
The test result collapsed .
The 2007 world champion was only allowed to train in the second week of June, as shown by the non-roller test of the KIHU, the research centre for competition and elite sports, on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a treadmill, which is increased in speed every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's finger tip with a needle.
Last fall, I stayed on the mat for 32 minutes, but this fall, I only stayed for 28.
Fire against the wall, Manninen tells us.
A Better Way to Go
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he has remained healthy.
I have been doing a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize my metabolism.
We've had a really good five weeks.
Juhann also had a week and a half off from flying.
I've got time to take my family to the cabin.
Last season, Manninen only played in four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup home games.
The best result was seen in the opening race, when Manninen finished 18th in the high jump.
Directions drawn
Manninen and national team coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that extends until next February.
We're going to pick up a different rhythm for practice than last season.
After the Ensiluma races, Ruka will have a weekend of three World Cup races.
In December, the idea would be to be involved in at least one World Cup weekend, maybe Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plan is to be in Seefeld.
"Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list", Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for China.
Now, the most important thing is to stay healthy, celebrating the Numelian underlining that won gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City team competition.
The dinosaur was protected from its enemies by disguise.
At first glance, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first results of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that researchers were even able to determine that its mucous skin was reddish-brown and had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best-preserved representative of its kind in the world.
The most recent fossil is a nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the Jurassic period, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He came across something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his find more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Museum of Paleontology in Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of a 3,000-pound [1,100 kg] block.
The hard work is finally paying off.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep", says science writer Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this herbivore, even though it had armor and resembled a walking armored car.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker top and lighter bottom coloration that is still found in many animals.
Experts say that this enabled it to blend in better with its environment and avoid its larger enemies.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
The researchers have named it Borealopelta after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team that spent over 7,000 hours digging up the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus is so amazingly well preserved that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the pattern and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a coloration common in the animal kingdom, with the body darker on top and lighter on the bottom.
Still, the discovery was a surprise, since Borealopelta is considerably larger than modern animals with similar coloration.
This suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to the extent that evolution favoured hiding over fighting as a means of survival.
Modern animals such as the deer, zebra, and armadillo have similar coloration, but they are much smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also severely threatened.
"The plundering of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur is a testament to how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Jurassic were", says Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the feces of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish.
Scientists are continuing to study the Nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate in its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank back to the sea floor.
Alberta was then as warm as Florida is now, and rivers and seas likely extended much farther than they do today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because its smooth skin has been preserved and it has been preserved in three-dimensionally in its original form", Brown says.
That's why it looks almost exactly like it did in the early mating season.
It takes little imagination to visualize it: a twinkle in the eye can almost make you believe that it was asleep.
The Mesozoic was the era of the theropods, giant, bipedal, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
For example, the predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 35 feet long.
The latest findings by scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in the journal Current Biology, suggest that Borealopelta may have washed up in the sea after its death and been mummified in mud.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011, in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, with skins and armor from the head to the hips.
The nodosaur was an average of five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-inch spikes rose from their burrows.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian travelled through what is now western Canada until a flooded river carried it out to sea.
The armor has been preserved in a submerged tomb, with minor details.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin is still present in the perforated plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery".
The closer you look at it, the more mind-boggling it seems.
The fossilized skin is still present in the hollow plates of its cranial armor.
Its right foreleg is on its side, five toes up.
I can count the number of spokes on that foot.
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who owns the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis, and he was sitting on the bed in his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That 's when she noticed a message from a friend at school .
"A police officer just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still in the street".
And then, frustrated, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper from St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The same user had also posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police wearing zippers and people shouting, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, carrying a sign that read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched live video footage of a police officer standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another police officer firing his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell recalled.
It was not the kind of murder we are used to and might call typical.
I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 p.m. and Ferrell went to pick up his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was documented in the documentary film Whose Streets? which was released in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, and strength and perseverance, as seen by the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, they reenacted a conversation about "what it's like to be black and what conditions you're in", a subject they had spoken about countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you about how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell recalls telling his daughter.
We're going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right.
"I couldn't not take my daughter with me", Ferrell said later.
Today's events are the culmination of past events.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow up with it.
He needs to have the capacity for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the layers and the conditions of the black experience, and he needs to know what we have to do to free ourselves, to free ourselves.
And even though I'm lucky to have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she's still the same as all the other black girls.
I feel like I'd be hurting her if I was protecting her from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across from the police station, which became a campsite for activists as they waited for information on the case and finally learned that the police would not be charged.
From there, Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packs.
They packed lunches into bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after 9/11, " she says. " While attending the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the minority nursing student organization, focusing on food rights and health disparities in black communities.
I had no experience in organizing.
It just happened.
Weeks later, at an evening rally, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell" what was going on.
Ferrell was suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for this suspicion was the innumerable times that people, mostly white, had appeared in the local community, seeking to profit from its difficulties and its tenacity.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a voice", Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently".
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism on death row.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other local people, and the film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
'This is not a documentary where someone talks to us or talks for us, it's us talking,' says Davis.
For me, the most important thing was how the local people are portrayed in the film, because I am portrayed in the same way.
Folayan said that the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but to show that the people's movement was not about a charismatic leader but about a community.
That's why the documentary reveals surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I felt quite naked", Ferrell laughs as he recounts what it was like to see the film for the first time.
But I realized that this job and the humane portrayal of black people requires a certain vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story re-focuses the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The #BlackLivesMatter movement was born on social media after the police shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, and two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going", says Ferrell. "That's because we're constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with it all.
Folayan agrees: The movement is really being driven by black women, and there are a lot of queer women among them.
However, she stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary 'intentionally' because of her queer identity.
"He got the energy moving", Folayan says.
It's no accident that she was on the front lines, though, because black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted on the silver screen.
News crews have long since left Ferguson, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole remaining, and he was sentenced for blocking the freeways during a protest.
His description of the socio-political climate in his home town is short and to the point: "Sekasotku".
Yet he still believes in the slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only destroy our chains.
Appropriate likeness: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning 's DNA
At the Fridman Gallery in New York, a series of faces - white, black, and brown - hanging in the center of the exhibition space, and when you look closely, you can see the resemblance between them.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent the samples from the federal prison at Fort Leavenworth, where he was serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborough A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It's based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, a woman who combines technology, information technology and art, and Manning, a transgender, radical dissident who was commuted by Barack Obama on the third day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg algorithmically analyzed Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data, which are a sharp, if slightly theoretical, take on the mutability of DNA data, the complexity and interpretations of causal relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified with women since she was a teenager, and was convicted in 2013 of 20 felonies, including violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
The only picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison, was a grainy, black-and-white selfie of Manning sitting in the driver's seat, looking embarrassed, wearing a platinum-white wig that became his trademark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a highly acclaimed Stranger Visions project in 2015 that he completed in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, including DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gum, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of her story", Dewey-Hagborg told the press at the launch of the new exhibition.
Manning was denied access to the hospital and couldn't be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in taking a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his captive muse suddenly became pen pals, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored a comic book called "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and would have been able to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama commuted Manning's sentence just days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven years of hard labor in a military prison in the United States.
It's also impressive that the exhibition opens at a time when Donald Trump is waging his own war against cybercriminals and transgender soldiers and constantly inventing new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divides he was supposed to be easing.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose".
On the wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist, with Manning's large handwriting below, with a heart as the i-point of the last name.In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the 'automatic division' on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence, a long line of letters C, G and A, written in lead pencil.
With this 200-letter combination of , or  for nucleotide, as the artist's scientific definition goes, Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
'I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are all equals in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation,' says Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells countless stories. Here are 30 of them.
The last work in the exhibition is in his room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
It's Manning's character rising from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can get you silenced, they've won", the picture says.
♪ Don't ever shut up ♪
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning", says the artist from Philadelphia.
It's so impressive that I still get cold spots.
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibit, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic information, like a crowd of protesters in the middle of an exhibit.
It's intentional, like everything else in this exhibit: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height that is the same as his height.
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring the feeling of a crowd to them", says Dewey-Hagborg.
I wanted to capture the movement that Chelsea had created, and that was also behind his release.
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in the murder of
Police say they have launched a nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court records show that warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, on suspicion of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, and the warrants are issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of bail.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local news release issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police responding to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple stab wounds on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide, with police actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mailed statement, the university's vice provost for public affairs, Alan K. Cubbage, said Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the Northwestern campus.
"This is a criminal matter being investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior fellow at Oxford University, working as a financial assistant.
In a statement emailed to a spokesperson for the university and Somerville College, it is stated that 'we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the US in any way possible'.
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications director Anthony Guglielmi said he would strongly urge suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"Police have a good idea of their whereabouts and we are constantly looking for them", Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are helping to track down suspects.
He told the police that they had received a call from the landlord of the Grand Plaza building who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as "horrific".
According to Guglielmo, it's unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras showed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair", Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following notice to residents: "Police are currently investigating the events and background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence".
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill all Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", the convict told the police.
Moffatt will be required to complete 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of a number of offences, including aggravated assault.
According to the police, they were approached by the staff of the bookstore on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims".
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught making a phone call to the police about a threat.
The threat was not related to the events at the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incident, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police during interrogation.
As punishment, he must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay £620, or about $690 in court costs, and £85, or about $95, in compensation to the victims.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that a number of hate crimes are being left unreported.
 We will decide on the actions under the WADA Roadmap in the near future   Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to RUSADA.
Some of the measures in the roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in these areas, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA's powers, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing to worry about in Russia.
Everything is announced and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
However, one of the targets of the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer commissioned by WADA, into the alleged role of the state in doping in Russian sports.
Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All the necessary measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist.
Mutko's words echoed a statement by the chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking earlier in the day to the Russian sports media RSport, Smirnov acknowledged that there had been problems with the Russian anti-doping body. We have said on several occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
We are not going to accept the report without preconditions, he added.
In November 2015, WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping controls in Russia after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was given permission to plan and coordinate the testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA's director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow, where he concluded that the organisation was 'on the right track' towards the return of its powers.
The British Association sceptical about innovation, which is so popular in Finland: 'No evidence' of the health benefits of maternity packaging
A British organization is questioning the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the Lullaby Trust, an organisation fighting against covert deaths, is banning its own brochures from being used in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in certain areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of CVD.
Sudden infant death means the sudden unexplained death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK's leading health authority on safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be wrapped in them, because it would give the impression that we are recommending this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is due to a number of factors, including a low rate of teenage pregnancy.
The fact that they give every family a box may be one factor.
But that's not what we know for sure, said Francine Bates, executive director of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden death.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland free of charge for 80 years.
The package contains various accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box in which a child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government says the boxes they distribute meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, for its part, says that there is no safety standard for sleeping in a carpeted area.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packing may be the best sleeping place if no bed or bunk is available.
The organization recommends that the packet be used only for naptime and be discontinued when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and taking care that it does not get wet or dirty.
A clever villain escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff of a Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff with its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the bad guy left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very worried, said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old frog is a female, weighing 55 kilograms and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
At noon, the villain is allowed to roam freely within the preschool grounds.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of a turtle.
The last time the rabbit escaped was a week later.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road about 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid the same mistakes as Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys weren't working.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured them that the questions were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious.
"The surveys were simply not consistent and objective", says Errett, whose company Madison Reed, which focuses on online sales and employs 75 people, is a hairdressing company.
Errett decided to turn to outside help.
There are more and more new types of HR start-ups that are coming to the market, helping other companies to figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, allow companies to create surveys and target them to specific teams and demographics, and provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct access to management beyond the top.
"You can track your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the corporate Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint, a Redwood City-based startup that provides analytics software to companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett, who has been using Glint's software for three years, says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
It can be used to make quick surveys and votes for specific teams, and it can be used to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings, which has enabled Errett to get to the heart of the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to follow workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, and the transportation industry has been in turmoil since a former employee blogged about a culture where employees are harassed and those who speak out are punished.
For startups like Glint, these failures are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that could be worth over $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies detect and prevent misconduct, gained interest earlier this year after Uber suffered a reputational collapse.
Convergent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed a deal with Uber as well.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to create custom surveys, confidentially collect responses in real time, and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if there's any reason to suspect impropriety, complaints go directly to the company's board.
'Popular opinion has displaced the authorities' says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees poorly or acts unethically, even if the authorities do not intervene, the consequences can be costly: consumers may boycott the company, and it may lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations and has been using Convercento for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect to headquarters.
The practice used to be that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she first had to find a phone number or email address to report the problem to the head office, then make a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience", says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's legal director, who says it was difficult to follow up on complaints from employees.
In the past, problems were hidden from managers working in another city or state, but now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I'm getting a more holistic and comprehensive view of the worker's reality", says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the collapse of the Arthur Andersen audit firm as a result of unethical practices in the Enron scandal.
It wasn't until social media that companies realized they could no longer stop their shills from being publicly exposed.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology became the control of ethics", says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, for which a fee is charged on a regular basis.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's accepted by the venture capitalists, and both Glint and Convercent have the backing of the venture capitalists.
Convercent raised $10 million in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and has raised $47 million in total.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised $60 million in total funding.
The investments are not surprising, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies have shown that workers expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In a competitive market like the Silicon Valley, good pay and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful enterprise.
Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they feel comfortable in the company and feel that they are heard and that their work is rewarding, says Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's director of employee compensation and wellbeing.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, and companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that investors are interested in them.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it's useless if it doesn't lead to action.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change is not coming fast enough or if nothing changes, frustration can reduce employee engagement.
'If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,' says Russell Raath, CEO of management consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on mere data collection.
If the company does not take action, workers will wonder whether they were heard
And if their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts monthly staff surveys and is able to pick up the problem the same day it's reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a better understanding of its employees and hopes that this deeper understanding will help it to improve staff retention in the long term in an industry known for its high turnover of employees.
'If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,' says Vitrano.
If it loses employees, it loses customers.
And without customers, there are no businesses.
In Sweden a 20-year-old man is suspected of stalking a naked woman in his neighborhood, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a cord outside her window.
She said the cell phone camera was in the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, had run to another room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon afterward it had been lowered again into the window.
A 20-year-old suspected of eavesdropping has admitted to taking pictures of the woman.
But he claimed he only photographed a woman's face.
The video taken on the phone had been deleted, and the police had been unable to recover it as evidence.
During questioning, the man has admitted to the crime, but denied any involvement.
The man in the photo had justified his actions by saying that he loved his neighbor "like crazy".
According to the news agency TT, the man will be charged in the case.
Teachers are demanding more liquor at the fall recess .
The EU's newly-elected President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said that the EU should be able to take action to help the country's economy.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the EU's financial instruments.
We cannot enter into agreements which do not include any reductions in the fine.
Municipal contracts don't come into effect until the private sector papers are signed and the interest rates are known.
Luukainen predicts that, for example, the terms of employment of OAJ will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed by Luukkainen.
Luukkainen is also the Yukon chairman of the Public Sector Trained Consultants' Association.
The European Union has a long-term strategy for the future.
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is growing.
According to Luukkainen, the temporary reduction in holiday pay is exacerbating the differences in earnings.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine the number of pupils per teacher.
The OAJ also notes that the disparity between the best and the worst performers is growing, and that the equality of basic education must be ensured.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining and disparities between pupils and regions are continually increasing.
The Bruins had a day when the NCAA reduced daily practice from two to one.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players are left to chat on the other side of the campus's new practice fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, their backs glistening with sweat after the first day of boot camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, the players attending the university's summer courses return to their dorm to study for their final exams, and the next morning, they gather at the Wasserman Football Center at 7:30 a.m.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The college athletic conference reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one, a change intended to reduce the workload of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
So UCLA's first three practices began at 7:45 p.m., and the players' already-packed schedules made it difficult to find space.
The limitation of practice to one day means that there are more practice days than before, the camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six-year coaching tenure at Westwood that the practice sessions are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The drills are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season opener begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the schedules of the players even tighter.
We put a lot of work on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging, says Mora.
But the players are willing to work, and they're great friends.
I think things will be easier when we get to Saturdays, when we'll have more time.
UCLA is closing down practice to outsiders after camp, which is not easy, considering the direct view from the practice field to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a posh hotel that's already been bombed by flying footballs over the safety net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits there could be problems during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements", says Mora.
The concern is that people can book a room and film the exercises on video.
They pay a lot of money for a video of the drill.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not gonna bother with it too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom for Rwanda
The central African nation of Rwanda will hold presidential elections on Friday, the winner of which is already being considered.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
The rebel group RPF then stopped the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
The European Union is also calling on the United Nations to support the peace process in the country.
He's also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will be able to seek a third term as the constitution was changed to limit the presidency to two terms.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely respected leader.
Under his leadership, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and has seen an influx of international investment.
In addition, Kagamé has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to question whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagameki has promised his people more freedom once the country is back on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook to fight fake news by increasing fact-checking
Facebook plans to send more and more fake news to independent fact-checkers and post the results below the original article, the world's largest social network announced Thursday.
The company posted a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect fake news, sending potential fake news to fact-checkers, and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the biggest purveyor of fake news, and many people believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has risen in political debate in Europe, with French voters being bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and the September elections, and Germany is backing a plan to fine social media networks if they don't remove hateful content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement posted in Germany that fact-checking trials are being conducted in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the independent peer review, and they also want more background information to help them make more informed decisions about what they read and share", Sara Su, Facebook's head of product for news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the feature of "Articles Related to the Topic" and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Comic Book is Born: A Tale of a Castle
The small town of Sceniotney in Kent is now known for its Squeeze music video and as a hiding place for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But with 700 years of turbulent history behind it, this charming castle in the Bewlin River Valley is now the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-headed writer who loves old documents.
"I'm thrilled to be able to examine a text written by someone who died over 300 years ago", Rhodes says, with a sigh.
I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each story illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonists: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives, as he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, inspired by the British National Library's archives.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 1700s", Rhodes says.
It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because in those days, they used fire for lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he's actually there.
I love the archives!
The writer, who was drawn to old documents, was able to stay in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and England's National Council of the Arts, which seemed too good to be true, and he admits he couldn't resist staying in the castle a little longer than he would have liked.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian castle, the archives, the treasures and rarities, like the hyenas' heads hanging on the walls and the bottles that had been in the valley for centuries.
He wandered the ruins and grounds of the old castle, and conversed with rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists who illustrated books.
He drank whiskey every night and started writing.
The history of Scotney is fairly obscure, as the castle passed entirely into the hands of the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyn, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff had just begun to go through the archives, which, as Rhodes describes, had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. 'You'd think landlords would be boring,' says Rhodes. 'But here, families would fight over even one piece of land.
I was thinking, "Let's just leave it at that".
Some of the stories in the book extend from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, which tells the story of a man who soon after the castle's completion becomes involved in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex' mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,' Rhodes says.
The English peasant riot began in the same area, and it occurred to me that a rebellion might begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the castle's history  such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (this was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotland, and the men in the family seem to have been quite the spendthrifts, constantly going into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell men solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old ladies, and I see them as handsome fellows who knew how to stir up the heirloom.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäe, a healing center in the early 20th century, of which only a well-watered plot remains.
Scottney's castle holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave", she says.
I didn't want to go back to this damn place yet.
The worst relations between Russia and the US since the Cold War.
The EU is also seeking to strengthen its relations with the EU, which are the most important trading partners for the EU.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it's fair to say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, in particular since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability in the eastern Ukraine caused by Russia, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
The EU is also calling on the EU to take action to prevent the spread of the virus.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had already said that the US-Russian standoff had reached a "dangerously bad" level.
Trump called for a "thank you" to the countries' bad-luck Congress, which last week passed new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko is out of the match. The rematch against Anthony Joshua is off.
Longtime heavyweight champion of the world Vladimir Klitschko will end his career.
Klitschko, 41, from Ukraine, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of them.
He held the World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
The club lost their last two matches.
He was knocked out by Tyson Fury in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
But the kid couldn't find the motivation to fight.
"I deliberately spent the last few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match", Klitschko said in a statement.
I've achieved everything I ever wanted as an amateur and a professional boxer, and now I want to start another career after sports.
I never imagined I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Watch the video of Klitschko explaining his decision.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a press release that the decision to end the club was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
The Commission has already taken a number of decisions in this area.
Klitschko has been in a relationship since 2009 with American actress Hayden Panettiere.
The couple have one child, a daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
From 2008 to 2012, the brothers held the World Championships in different leagues at the same time.
Finnish weatherman witches the conditions: "Vie fiilistä"
The pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer off-season.
Minna Nikkas has had some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken away the woman's grace.
Even the London World Cup is a volatile environment.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The odds have been against Minna Nickas this summer.
"I don't want to blame the track, but it was unbelievable that I couldn't even get the little sticks moving properly", Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I've raced and trained here many times and I've never experienced such a change in wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
"It's been really difficult to keep the jump steady this season, because even in practice there have been such unstable winds", said Nikkanen at the Kaleva Games.
It was raining in London on Thursday.
It's been a challenge to get the technology back together, whether it's cold-blooded or whatever.
It's been cold and windy and it's been killing me.
There's no point in using up energy under these conditions.
He made it to the World Championships with his 455 in the pole vault.
It's been 445 outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
We must be patient and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to get over 460 in the Friday race.
Why don't you move to a foreign country and train?
That's not necessary.
Last summer, I was a freshman in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump on the pile and a steady technique.
I probably should have done the same thing.
The normal guy has been in the gym for practice, but the gym is closed.
What would be the ideal thing to do?
It's a high of 95 degrees.
A little wind is fine, as long as it's consistent.
A former government official has been harassing politicians in the public square: "We have no money to distribute now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep a lid on the situation and avoid inflating the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no money to be had.
Yle interviewed Virtas, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday in Ykkössamo.
The state budget for next year is just about to start.
The Commission has recently put forward proposals to raise the pension guarantee, lower the car tax and support electric bicycles.
They are mostly about the fact that elections are coming up, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no distribution right now or for many years.
"It is even treason for me to speak of theft when the debt is taken", said the Fountain to the Yelle.
The fountain emphasized that all debt is debt to the children.
Mr Virtas has a long experience in preparing government budgets: he started as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance in 1978 and then worked as assistant head of the budget department and as head of the budget department.
Most recently, before his retirement, he was Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Ylen that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimated that this would be a peak from which the next year would be a downward slide, and Finland expects growth of one per cent for decades.
Washington is changing the rules on permanent residency.
President Donald Trump announced in the media that the rules of the green card will be changed with the new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules are being proposed by the Republicans, and the president is endorsing them.
The bill is scheduled to be debated in both chambers of Congress.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residency is granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce the chain of migration and replace the current programme.
"The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to media reports.
The wife of the Danish queen doesn't want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henry does not wish to be buried with Queen Margaret.
This is Prince Henry and Queen Margrethe, photographed in April.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couples are buried in the same place.
The Royal Household has announced today that Prince Henry does not wish to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to the B.T. magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, commented Lene Belleby, head of communications at the court, in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his spouse.
The Court has said that the Queen has long been aware of her husband's wishes regarding the burial site and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: the car nearly hit the highway
Tom had his ex-wife and two small children on board.
They weren't injured in the accident, but they won't get the insurance money if the other party isn't reached.
The crash occurred at the Keimolan Gate in Vantaa.
This is an archive photo from the construction site of the Kehä III.
Tommi, a Vantaa resident, says his family survived a car accident on Tuesday night.
Tommi, his half-sister Riina and the couple's two small children were driving on the highway near Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaalla Hämeenlinna.
Tommi says that a white car was driving along the acceleration line from the intersection of Kehä III to Hämeenlinnanväylä, and had to drive on the side of the family car.
If it wasn't for the skirmish, the car would have been run over by Tom.
I was braking and turning the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car was speeding into the sidewalk.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were uninjured.
One of the children is just under three years old, the other is under one.
Apparently, it was a pretty good tour, seeing as we didn't get hurt.
No one even drove past us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened at approximately 5:20 p.m.
Tom said that no one stopped to visit them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue services personnel arrived and checked on the family.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says that she and her stepmother have a small income, and they received a donation from a relative to help them buy a car a few years ago.
Tom says without the other car's information, the family won't get the insurance money.
So the family is hoping that eyewitnesses will have any insight into the car that caused the family to drive off the road.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to daycare and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tom saw that the car was white, an old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thinks the car's registration number started with SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we'll manage financially, we'll have to count every cent now.
Tom is hoping that anyone who saw what happened or knows anything about it will contact the police.
The police in East-Udonia and the rescue service in Central-Udonia confirm that they were at the accident site on Tuesday night.
The headline and story corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to the story originally told, the second car Tom was driving was not in the opposite lane, but was driving from the accelerator to the side of the family's car.
The play, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships through humor.
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola is bringing her first-ever play to the What? Theatre.
The Reveal is a musical theater show about failed relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jappis, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is dealt with in a humorous manner.
"You can't get rid of a bad feeling", he says.
According to the Junkie, the touring summer theater show was made on a petty budget and with a big, young heart.
The title of the show challenges us to think about what a person reveals about himself when he meets a new person.
Is he pulling off a role or is he approaching the other coat?
The unthinking presentation confuses fact and fiction .
The bastard has both directed and dramatized the show.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The play is written by the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that although the show draws on the thoughts of young people, it will appeal to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Self-Revelation does not directly tell about his own or the work group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my world of values will care about the performance.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I don't think that relationships, especially relationships, are the key to happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer is painting a contemporary picture of young adults living in Finland in their 100s.
He says that many have learned much about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least, that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The task force also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is by Jappis and Rokka.
A love of the theater was born in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to be a theatre expression director at the Turku University of Applied Arts.
Two years behind us, another mess ahead.
The Juppie's enthusiasm for the theatre has been developing since the Kouvolan years.
She has been an assistant in the Kouvola Theatre and has acted in the Ylioppilasteater in Helsinki and most recently in the Linnateater in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in directing.
The self-revealer had its premiere last week in Helsinki at the Fool's Theatre.
The show, which lasted about 45 minutes, was also seen in the future, at least in the university town of Jäppinen in Turku.
The self-revelation of Kouvola at the What? Theater, August 4th, 7 p.m. and August 5th, 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - a broken neck.
There are few athletes in Finland who are as unstoppable as Janne Lahtela.
The double-double ace traveled the world hundreds of days a year for two decades, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtelan movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist has not tried at least once.
It's been a real motivation to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the Bay entirely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds in my house for a year, Lahtela says.
Bad luck on the Bay.
He also admits that age may have played a role.
Yeah, well, riding a scooter might sound crazy.
But I didn't push it to the limit.
It's just a sport so hard that a 40-year-old like this shouldn't be over-exercised!
After the accident, Lahte was in a unique situation.
His busy life came to a screeching halt.
There was a long-time coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the league right after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during training, Lahtela often challenged his proteges on the slope and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, the stopping was a good experience.
I was so exhausted physically and mentally that even my thoughts seemed to be out of order.
Not even in the species.
It's good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it, because I was really, really, just being me for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtel to become the head coach of Finland.
If he doesn't stop, he's afraid he'll burn to death.
It's easier to find the places that are broken than the ones that are intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speedsters.
I traded motocross for frisbee golf!
It was like a dream.
At my worst, I was throwing up seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not demand that his trainees be like him.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
Our species culture has room to be ourselves and ways to become the best in the world.
"Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been that", says Lahtela.
The sex robots are coming and we have reason to be worried
It's here: a report on the technological advances in the sex robot industry just as it was about to begin, as it seemed 2017 could not get any weirder.
Yes, you are.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
'We have to start taking the proliferation of sex robots seriously,' says Noel Sharkey, founder member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the type of its fingernails.
'Sex robots are being scoured, but they are already sold in quite large numbers and we will see more of them,' said Sharkey at the launch of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-sensing silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that mimic human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to his or her own preferences, from eye color to nipple shape and type and color of fingernails.
Even more troubling is the fact that the robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shyness.
The Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is perfectly matched to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
He also has different moods:
It could be tired, or chatty, or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features in the proliferation of sex robots, replacing real human relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and the outright rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistant.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
Why shouldn't men have sex robots?
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is a sign of something darker and deeper in our culture: a retreat from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where submission is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not purchase sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report says their popularity is growing.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of the times.
And many people only start acting weird or offensive when the market allows it.
It's no coincidence that sex robots have become so common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and the White House is occupied by a president who has been praised for harassing women.
What's disturbing about the TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not its powerful imagery, like the images of hanged bodies and eyes being dug out, but the realistic feel of the show's world.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now, it seems a surprisingly short trip.
Attempts are made to make sex robots as much like real women (in the proportions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
The designers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as closely as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They have no will of their own, no history, nothing to suggest independence or to break the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
The slave.
Police suspect two terror attacks were planned in Australia by a group led by an ISIS chief.
The leader of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men who were suspected of planning to carry a bomb onto an Etihad Airways plane.
A senior ISIS figure was also credited with sending the construction parts of the bomb to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
The bomb was supposed to be brought on board the plane on July 15th, but the attempt was aborted before security checks.
The police won't give any details as to why the attempt was aborted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to construct a device to release a toxic, colorless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday for suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but he too is being interrogated.
The good things about Trump?
He makes Mitt Romney look like a paragon of sanity.
It has been repeatedly and repeatedly said during the Trump era that the powerful division of voters has also broken families on a daily basis.
On the eve of Christmas and Thanksgiving, advice columns in American newspapers were given on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to explode our information bubble.
Less well-known is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm telling you this because my cousin came to visit me in New York this week, and he's a leftist poet from Chicago who's been at odds with our Republican bloodlines for a long time.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins - including my pro-Republican sibling with whom he's been arguing politics for decades - are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but in the larger scheme of things, it involves considerable risks.
Trump has given a new leash to the left, but the distorting influence of his presidency may actually be taking us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we may not be able to stand the horror of his tricks anymore.
In the long run, there is a more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the far-right Republicans, who suddenly seem to be quite sane compared to Trump.
I am reminded, rather hauntingly, of Mitt Romney's watered-down version of insanity: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and we have seen his tax returns, after all), which, compared to Trump, seem to be very mild infractions.
With Trump's term over, the next Republican presidential candidate will need to be able to think clearly, and that will immediately feel like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting, we took our baby to the Central Park carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel's horses are huge, the central figures  the grinning clowns and the terrified animals looking back  are ominous, and the screeching music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's landmarks fade into disappointment over time: the view from the high-rises becomes boring, the city's skyline becomes too familiar, and the city's reality no longer matches your dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, I'm not completely over the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a major traffic hub in North London, and the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-inspired pub, but it doesn't count.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience - even to the point that two two-year-olds, an eleven-year-old, and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full grade if someone had asked for my rating, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
Same thing at the coffee shop in my neighborhood, but they also give me the option to combine the estimate with a 15 percent service fee when I go to the counter to get my own coffee.
This slows down the usual interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put his personality into play in a situation where it's not needed.
The store clerk smiled with a sorry look on her face as I tiredly gave my credit card's rating of five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter because "he didn't have the trust of the management".
Today, Inter FC has released Shefki Kuqi from his duties as coach of the club's national team.
The new coach will be Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously assistant coach.
The other coaching team will continue with their current duties.
The Italian coach has previously worked as an assistant coach for clubs such as Sunderland in England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, has completed his UEFA Pro licence last year.
The chairman of the board of FC Inter, Stefan Håkans, is very sorry for what happened.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the club's press release.
The Piccareta contract runs until the end of the season.
He's in charge of the home game against HIFK tomorrow.
According to the Evening News, the team has been in a state of flux since Thursday.
Kuqi told the players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, have been moved to the sidelines.
Kuqi and Piccareta had a very tough fight against each other in the Inter game against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful picture of the '80s. Would you recognize a serious student of the violin?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of herself as a teenager on Instagram.
The image has been given several tags, which indicate that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself is amazed at the seriousness of a young woman looking at the camera.
Long ago, seriously, he is texting.
If you can't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published photos from his past and also spoke about sensitive topics.
A little over a year ago, he posted a couple of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In one picture, she's 20 years ago, in the other, she's posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his text, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago, and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
And then she added the following hashtags: life, eating disorder, insecurity, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
She was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia when she was 14.
She also developed bulimia, which was not diagnosed until 2006.
The recovery was gradual.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists that prison officials say he suffered after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing multiple shots through a bathroom door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they will appeal the conviction, saying Pistorius' six-year sentence is too lenient.
The prosecutor plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, possibly this year.
If the appeal is granted, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped in Greece were arrested, the country's Foreign Ministry announced on bTV.
On the morning of August 1st, the police arrested a group of people who had been camping in Sithonia without permission, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is still ongoing.
According to bTV, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry later announced that they had released the men.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and are already imposing significant fines on anyone who campes elsewhere than in designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry of Justice has informed me that the court may impose a fine.
The share of Nestee is falling - already down -7.7%
The stock of oil refiner Neste has fallen 7.7 percent around 11 o'clock.
Its earnings before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started to move slightly to the frozen side today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock market opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had fallen 0.2 percent.
The general index OMXH of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading, and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR 9 million was the morning's earnings announcement, Nestlé.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate might sound like a digestive nightmare.
However, recent research suggests the opposite: A diet high in meat protein and dairy products may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disease that affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, and it causes stomach cramps, bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although people with IBS are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan, found in the protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the gut and prevent harmful microbes lurking in food from entering the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by the cells that promote resistance, which protect the body without damaging the delicate tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
In experiments, immune cells that promote tolerance were found in mice that had a specific bacterium in their intestines.
Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins, and it is needed by the bacteria to make immune cells.
'We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of resistance-promoting cells, which are part of the normal gut microbiome,' says Professor Colonna.
 The more tryptophan the mice ate, the more these immune cells were present. 
If the same effect is observed in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory susceptibility.
In her study of immune-boosting cells, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that, while one group of mice had such cells, the same mice kept in isolation did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of the mice, the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When they examined the gut DNA of the mice, they found six different types of bacteria that were present in the mice with immune cells, but not in the other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that had grown up in a sterile environment, but had no gut microbiome and had not developed immune cells, the immune cells started to appear.
To find out how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transferred small amounts of liquid - free of bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into cells that enhance tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of resistance-enhancing cells increased by about 50 percent; when the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same immune-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but there have been some cases of tryptophan-related genetic defects in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.
'We probably want to encourage the development of these cells, because they regulate inflammation in the intestinal lining,' says Cervantes-Barragan.
 High levels of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their proliferation.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have "grown" after signing Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got their 'no' after signing Nemanja Matic, who made his debut for Manchester United against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who joined from Chelsea for £40m, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's penultimate game of the season ahead of Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid, impressing as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, as he was not part of the blue shirts' Asian tour before the start of the season, and he only lasted 45 minutes on the pitch.
He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and way of thinking make him a genius he has the natural football mind, says Mourinho.
We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later.
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cool the starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, despite the club having already done a "fantastic job" of acquiring three of his four priority players.
'Three out of four' he added, 'have to be thanked to the community.'
I'd be more satisfied if I had all four, but they did a great job.
The German team was teased by the balloonists for two rounds .
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Championship to Germany 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German standard of play is very high.
"Their game was even in every sector", said Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi in a press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept their opponents in a tight spot, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
The strongest player in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Three of the four games lost by Finland will be played against Slovenia on Sunday.
The grand jury has already issued challenges to Trump Jr's Russia meeting.
In the United States, a grand jury has issued challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja over a meeting between them.
A grand jury convened by special counsel Robert Mueller has already issued subpoenas for Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitska, a Russian lawyer with a known Kremlin connection.
This is according to Reuters, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the grand jury.
Reuters reported that the grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Veselnitska, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Also in attendance were Donald Trump Sr.'s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
Reuters sources say that the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller has summoned a grand jury in Washington, means the Russia investigation is gathering pace.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help investigate Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or its inner circle cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury is extending Mueller's rights to collect evidence, subpoena, and compel people to testify under oath.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence gathered by the prosecution in the investigation and decide whether to press charges.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and his car with a wave of his hand.
A British inventor has become the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, enter his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
With a microchip between his thumb and forefinger, 33-year-old Steven Northam now offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical standards.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchip for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company is also making locks on houses and cars compatible with the microchip, and it costs £300 to process one lock.
Northam is married with one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House display piece cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars .
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter on the south lawn of the White House for an American production event cost the taxpayer $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the flagship at the White House on July 17, 2017, for an event to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were able to see products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter built in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter on a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the south lawn for an "exceptional" event, according to Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet documents.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it's an extraordinary event that's going to get a lot of publicity", the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an e-mail the day before the event to his superior, who is the naval flight commander.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn on July 17 at 7:00 a.m. and that the event would begin at 3:00 p.m. The helicopter would leave after the lawn was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The message also stated that if the helicopter were to be delayed from the White House, a second crew would be needed to attend due to time constraints.
The original crew was on the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were with the helicopter when it was down.
The documents obtained by TIME magazine do not reveal whether a second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act in the United States prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether the incident was a violation of the law.
One of the questions we had was, "Is this a violation of the Hatch Act?"
'It sounds like you can attend,' replied the Deputy Commander.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it didn't fall under the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of health care reform, which was then being debated in the Senate, and looser government regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopters and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them on their trips.
But using them for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions came to the attention of the public in February when Air Force One rolled over the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, after Trump strongly criticized his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft on Twitter.
The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials in all 50 states, said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of HMX-1 are making regular training flights in the Washington area, practicing on the south lawn bringing the president to the White House in centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
One official said that the flights for the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day on 'non-presidential support missions'.
The White House says the event has not caused any additional costs to the taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing the helicopter show on the White House South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no record of any flights associated with the President's duties, and accurate estimation of the cost of the event is difficult.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 files, the flights from the Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
The White House says the cost of operating a helicopter is significantly less.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading", says Walters.
The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure is selective since it does not distort competition and is not liable to affect trade between Member States.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
'The idea is to showcase American production,' said Spicer.
I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their role in ensuring national security and, in doing so, employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopters and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked so hard to build.
It is entirely appropriate to bring it up.
It's not clear if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but he was able to land a fire truck in the driver's seat.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
'I know Sikorsky very well', the President said. 'I have three of them.'
Lightning strike on Vaasan railway - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train service between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is interrupted due to a technical malfunction, according to the Railway Transportation Centre.
The trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The lightning was caused by a failure in the traffic control system.
The RTA had no estimate of the repair time as of this morning.
Venezuelan Attorney General asks for the right to block the appointment of new representatives
The Venezuelan Prosecutor General has requested a court order to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegation elected in last Sunday's vote is to be appointed on Friday.
The controversial vote elected a representative body that can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to the Attorney General, Luisa Ortega, the injunction was requested because of alleged electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started an investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised the representative vote told him that the results had been manipulated.
The company claims that the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately one million more than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were eligible to run for the House of Representatives, and the 545-member House of Representatives includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to changing the constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as a way for Maduro to consolidate his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have all announced that they do not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new cabinet is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
They have injured dozens of people and killed over a hundred.
Venezuela plunged into economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is expected to make a statement on Friday, when the new parliament is due to be opened.
Russian man extradited from Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the US
On Thursday, the Minneapolis District Court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senahi to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a worldwide computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
Finnish border authorities arrested him on his way home.
In February 2016, Finland surrendered Senah to US authorities despite Russian objections, AFP news agency reports.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud that had resulted in millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving his sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Finland after the arrest, saying that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The opinion blamed Finland and the United States for the arrest in Finland without Russia's prior knowledge.
The prosecution claimed that Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to steal usernames and passwords.
Fraudsters then used the information to redirect Internet traffic to create click-through scams and to spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, the deputy director of the Justice Department's Crime Division, said the case demonstrated the U.S. ability to pursue other cybercriminals.
"We have the ability and the will to identify, locate and bring them to justice", Blanco said in a statement.

In a newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
The new faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro. They are all from the same school.
Narcos season three starts September 1st.
Kari Kola is creating an extraordinary light art installation in Paris
The light artist Kari Kola (pictured) will be creating an extraordinary light artwork to celebrate the first UN Day of Light in Paris next year on May 16.
Kola's going to Paris to do a piece of light art called Day and Night.
The theme of the work is light and darkness, day and night, sun and moon.
The work highlights the UNESCO headquarters, the Fontenoy Building, and the Globe Monument in front of it.
I want my work to emphasize not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in cities of millions is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
My art allows me to make the important things I feel tangible and visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art as part of the theme of the day", continues Kola.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light theme in 2015, when she lit up the UNESCO headquarters in honor of the celebration.
I feel very privileged to be able to bring my art back to UNESCO headquarters", says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanded significantly.
We will be informing you about this later in the autumn, continues Kola.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise people's awareness in the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of Paris on 16 May.
Two men were fighting in the parking lot of a shopping mall in Espoo .
Two men had a fight in the parking lot of the Big Omen shopping mall in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver who drove in the prohibited lane would have struck the driver of the other car, which then started and collided with the driver's car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car he had just hit.
The man has admitted to causing the damage and to wrongdoing.
Question mark article by Timo Soin entitled "Then the Flood Came"
The Foreign Minister, Timo Soini (S&D), published a blog post on Thursday, with the question mark as its title.
The essay is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references to 18th-century France in the text of the sonnet.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the metaphor of the flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the words "the flood after us" or "the flood after me" have been left in the history books.
The UN says Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The EU is also calling for the release of the three former members of the UN Security Council, including the former President of the Council, Mr Gbagbo.
The interim head of the UN Relief Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said hundreds of women are running for county council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasised", Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Only if women participate fully and are included in all aspects of the electoral process can elections be truly representative and credible.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats about the elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the contribution of women would strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In the afternoon, the cloud cover will break and thunderstorms may develop.
It's clearer and more deserted tonight.
The southern and central parts of the country receive abundant rain from the coast, and thunderstorms can occur in the south.
It's south of the lunch table tonight, and it's clearer, so there's a chance of some rain showers.
The afternoon temperature is about eleven o'clock with rain, and on the southwest coast, after a more consistent rainfall, it is close to twenty degrees.
In the north, the cloud cover varies, and there are local afternoon thunderstorms.
During Friday and Saturday, low-pressure conditions prevail in the southern and central parts of the country, and rains are common.
In the north, the rains are scarce.

Flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local people are particularly angry at the cruise ships as a form of tourism.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: you are only there for a few hours and you rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is overwhelmed with tourists who make quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate, and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, as hotels have replaced homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are reported on in The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restricting tourist numbers.
They call what we have now low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you're given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-waving guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and then back, says Italy's Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in the architecture but also in the functioning of the place, the shops and the workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic center of Venice.
At the end of the square is the Church of St. Mark.
And the anger of the locals is also directed mainly at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50,000 locals.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has reduced their quality of life, destroyed the environment, and driven out the inhabitants.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years, Venice will be all tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe, one of the organisers of the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, since ships bring Venice much-needed revenue and create a need for jobs in a number of different sectors.
In addition to restricting tourism, the solution is to move cruise ships further away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the Veneto region, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Some 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice each year.
Are you driving around Kuopio?
Traffic jams on the motorway for miles
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, on the northbound lane, there was a traffic jam for kilometers at the time of the Thursday afternoon return from work.
The region is paving the highways, which is slowing down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
The roadworks are subject to a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of the normal speed of 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restriction area, traffic had picked up on Thursday afternoon, but in practice it was still at walking pace.
The road works continued on Thursday afternoon near the Golden Owl statue on the shore of Lake Siilin.
I can do without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to face the curse of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published some amazing photos of herself in the Grand Canyon landscape, among other places.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her native country, Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter hurdles by running the lap in 51.81 seconds.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record in the 400-meter hurdles at 55.38.
A heavy user of social media, Iuel soon realized after her record that there are dark sides to fame and publicity.
Men from all over the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Julie, apparently hoping that the young runner would take an interest in them.
I had to shut down the Snapchat account for outsiders.
I received a lot of "snapshots" from unknown people, so I had to make my account private, Iuel told VG.
In his interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can guess it. He was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I can do fine without that kind of attention.
I was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, her father Danish-Norwegian.
The family moved to Norway when she was two.
When Amalie was 12, her father's work took the family to Namibia and then to Pakistan.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015 he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
At Norja, he trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
People in Norway are much more open to talking than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions. They just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to interact personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400 metres and the 400 metres hurdles.
A foot injury has put Janne Korven's entire career on the line. Now he's in the World Championships.
It's been a nice run, not having been hurt!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has really enjoyed his beloved sport again this season.
Even last summer, the future of my career was in jeopardy.
A stress fracture in his foot had forced Korven to the operating table in January, and he had no intention of recovering.
I had a hand injury in a racing accident.
I didn't know what I was doing this summer, whether I was going to continue boating or not.
The sponsorship deals were off and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things do tend to work out.
My leg healed, the sponsors extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to flow again.
After that, it was an easy decision.
I didn't know that until the first time I went to the snow.
I was like, "Yeah, this is so much fun, let's do another couple of rounds".
Korp didn't get to count properly until September-October, but after a long counting hiatus, just training without pain has been a big deal.
The Raven has only been around a few of these races.
It's all right.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of sailing for Korve.
I've never been knocked down by a single race.
I think it's frustrating to be four years into a championship and then you're in the heat for that week.
I can't think like that, says Raven.
Today, Raven will compete in the Spanish Sierra Nevada halfpipe at the World Championships.
Even if individual races don't keep him on the board, he's always excited about racing with a lot of people.
According to Korv, the appreciation for the International Ski Federation's events has increased in recent years, although some sailors chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
This is a big race, and the visibility is huge.
I think that the appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on the Finnish 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's two leaders, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to see the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point myself, everything was new and I was so psychotic about everything.
It's bringing a new energy to itself, Vulture thinks.
I'll still be able to keep up with you on the ledge, but otherwise, no, that's how much power you guys have!
Janne Korpi has also built another kind of sports career.
The son of Pekka Korven, a legendary racehorse trainer, is addicted to the sport of racing: the trainer has his own racehorses, for whom he runs training programmes.
I'm always on the go, so I'm not gonna be able to be in the mess anymore.
But I watch the food scores every day, and usually the odds, Raven says.
According to Korv, anger management and rage control are potential career paths when his boating career comes to an end.
I don't plan that far, but it's a very likely option.
I feel it as if I'm studying it alongside this snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep up with the times, and I'm trying to develop, and maybe I'll do some running this summer.
If that's my future career, it's not hard to start, once you're already in the game.
The raving events also include the Elitloppet raving cruise with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twins have rented a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet food competition at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive an old tradition.
The cruise has been doing well, and people have been excited.
We're at the point now where we're not going bankrupt.
"We have a few months to go, so let's hope we can get the ship full", says Raven, excitedly.
Attendo's nanny business has caught everyone by surprise.
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat nursing home for the elderly to be built in Kite.
The 1,700-square-foot building will be completed by next summer, across the street from the health centre.
The question of what the new unit will be able to do with the customers is a matter of great interest to the public, for now, during the Siu War, many private nursing homes are suffering from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, regional director of care services at Attendolta, commented that there is a future demand in Kite for not only alternatives but also for improved service accommodation.
All kinds of services are needed, and with alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Canervikkol and Eerik from Kite.
The deal was for business, but the property is known to be under a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these premises.
More on that later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's branded Scotland factory.
The union is seeking confirmation from the managers of McVitie's biscuit manufacturer of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Scotland branch of the General Trade Union of Great Britain, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory that makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products has over 500 employees.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to be informed if there were any changes in the operation.
In its letter to the plant manager, the GMB called on the company to 'respond to the concern that no funding had been allocated to the modernisation of the production lines'.
GMB trade unionist Drew Duffy is very concerned that the plant manager is not getting clear information about Tollcross' business needs and future investment plans.
Families have worked here for generations, with a strong concentration of labour in the local community and the Greater Glasgow area.
In view of the continuing contraction in jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as the impact of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the continuing contraction in production, East Glasgow is in dire need of a successful McVitie's production.
According to the spokesman of Pladis, the factory manager had only received the union's letter the previous day and the company is responding directly to the letter because it values the continuous interaction with the workers and the union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to employees about, among other things, how, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continually evaluate all our businesses and locations to remain competitive.
A source said that in recent years, the company has invested over £5 million in the Tollcross plant, particularly in improving its production lines and operations.
We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a production facility and we will be the first to inform the workers and the trade union representatives if we are going to make any changes to the operation of the factory.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
The league may be regretting its interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after paying £189 million to close the transfer fee, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 team is set to break the world record for the most transfer fees, less than half the previous record set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of over £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's behaviour and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the club, and a source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs that PSG's best players were targeted.
I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we will become their opponents and contact their players, Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seem to be guilty of this: they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian go under any circumstances, and it is quite possible that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar as a result.
The fluid held the stock market back from rising.
The other big earner of the day, Metsä Board, was left with a bigger score.
The broad European general index Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% at the close of Helsinki.

NYT: Trump's alleged phone calls were fabricated - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, reports The New York Times.
Trump's prank phone calls with both the president of Mexico and the head of the Boy Scouts have been proven to be fabricated.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said that Trump didn't lie.
Sanders said many of the leaders of the Boy Scouts spoke to Trump in person, and that Trump had spoken to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty big accusation.
Those conversations were not just over the phone, they were face-to-face, Sanders argued.
The speech was disgusting to the Scouts .
Trump said Monday that the president of Mexico called him and praised Trump for his success in cracking down on illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told him that few people would ever cross the southern border of Mexico again, because they know that the journey would end up in the U.S. border.
The Mexican government issued a statement Wednesday saying that the call in question never happened.
On Tuesday, Politico published the full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
It was Trump's eulogy at the National Scout Association's big convention in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the boys' battalion, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts announced that they were unaware of any of their senior staff members calling Trump.
The release said that the previous statement by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, apologizing for Trump's speech to the Scouts, speaks for itself.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts meeting was a big surprise, because it was unusually political, given the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of the presidential election last fall.
