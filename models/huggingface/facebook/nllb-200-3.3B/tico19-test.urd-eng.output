The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK during 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall spread of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK is showing similar trends, with the global COVID-19 epidemic in all countries accelerating at different stages on a country-by-country basis.
Based on the Italian experience, hospitals and intensive care units in many countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will require care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is the novel coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca.14% of cases, COVID-19 is in the form of a more severe illness, requiring hospitalization, while in 6% of cases, those experiencing severe illness require intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with the Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has had a more geographic spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently consistent with that country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Surveillance, Speretri et al reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by the WHO case.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported on 24 January 2020 by three French nationals returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had reported COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Gathering the total number of COVID-19 cases and the total spread
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives data on COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide only from official sources, the daily 8:00 a.m. update of the countries' ministries of health, national and regional health authorities, and the World Health Organization.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day intermittent cumulative spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We presented the total reported case figures for each country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020 in comparison with Italy.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day intermittent cumulative spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries in general and the United Kingdom is consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then accelerated in 28 February 2020 (sub-content).
This was largely due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar upward trends (see sidebar).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy, during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It was highlighted that, as of 8:00 am on 15 March, only 3 weeks earlier or less, the total number of cases first reported in Italy was higher than in the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK combined.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, variations in national public health response and countries may have different definitions of cases and different protocols for patient selection, including the need to have a catch-up test to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to any hospital and/or intensive care unit are available (data not shown) for 6% and 1% of cases respectively at EU/EEA level.
However, recent surveillance data, including the number of reported cases and deaths, must be collected in a systematic manner to complement the current surveillance data.
A 2010-11 study showed that there has been a large change in the availability of acute and intermediate care beds in Europe, from a population per 100,000 beds ratio of 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have resources roughly on par with Italy (which had 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity expansion, estimates of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with >90% of the acute care bed capacity exceedance concern, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Alertness Assessment on COVID-19.
As there are case clusters in specific regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and generally hospital and intensive care units define the population of the regional region, case and intensive care bed information facilitate the available numbering of regional units of priority data 2 (NUTS-2).
The current trends in Italy and other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the increase in COVID-19 patients, such as in the affected areas of Italy, requires health care, especially intensive care.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment has indicated, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is required to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, which, combined with the shift from prevention to mitigation approach, if not implemented early, will not provide enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, recognise and adapt their response to the expected rapid increase in the number of cases.
The Acute Concern Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries are likely to further increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care providers.
Failing this, it is likely that healthcare providers in EU/EEA countries will face a critical care need in the coming days or weeks due to the increase in cases.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and over 80,000 people infected in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic human consequences.
Like its homologue SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by bats and causes the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it affects older people more than younger people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of diseases, and the ways to prevent and treat them.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review will help us understand and end this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese residents due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, all the holidays and several weeks of stay-at-home orders.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there were already over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths as a result of the virus.
WHO warned that COVID-19 is "the public enemy No. 1" and that it is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, causes, treatment and diagnosis since the first report on 7 January 2020 and which has led to the isolation of numerous patients, in less than two months.
The review attempts to summarize the creative progress in the new and rapidly developing subject area.
Where possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We'll talk about what we've learned about diagnosing and preventing the disease so far, as well as some of the important questions that remain.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common measles-4.
However, in this century, we have two highly lethal CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and soon the dreaded disease spread with its mortality rate to many other countries.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third pandemic of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the pneumonia clot of unknown origin was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The CoV sequence was released seven days later.
The first case of death was reported in Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infection was reported in healthcare workers, which meant that it was possible for it to be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan city was put on lockdown, with all public transportation shut down.
In the first clinical study of the disease on 24 January, only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the source of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
Another recent description of the epidemic was described in the following cell (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) in a multidisciplinary study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, on February 11, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in Hubei and surrounding areas.
The average duration of diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 (9-2) days from onset.
The average growth duration was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased sharply before June 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass transit before the Spring Festival in China.
The patient mortality of confirmed cases was 1.44% (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and multifamily viruses, which contain a mixture of sensory RNA.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The milk spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptide-like peptide 4 (DPP4) from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral genes are released into the cytoplasm, then after the viral genes are copied, the genes make RNA-enveloped glycocarbons and nucleocycodonts, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
More than 99.98% of 10 samples collected from the origin of the outbreak associated with the Huan seafood market in Wuhan, respectively, were found to be genetically identifiable to SARS-CoV-2, a new variant of beta.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to electron microscopy transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected on the extremely thin part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to act as a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-cell of SARS-CoV-2 is more weakly associated with human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV causes less infection than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form novel short leucemia encoded by orf3b and secret leucemia by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and express itself in IFNB, although no known active domain or form of orf8 exists.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao et al., reported complex resolution in the structure of EM at a full length of 2.9 Å of the human ACE2 with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which combined open and closed mutations as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex, could bind two S-bonds, which form evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate representative
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both originating in bats, have been transmitted to humans via feral cats and camels.
Bat is considered a local representative of SARS-CoV-2 through the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, as the new virus is 96% similar to the two SARS-like CoVs Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-COVZX21 from bats.
However, it is not yet known which intermediate agent has helped to cross the barriers to infect humans, and the transmission pathway cannot yet be explained.
Yett, J., et al., suggested snakes as the pathogen carriers of the virus from bats to humans with homologous rearrangement within the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that the long-snouted penguin, an ant-eating mammal, and the 99% genetic homology found in SARS-CoV-2 that is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine may be the possible intermediate representatives of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in prevalence between the two genomes is still a large difference, so, the final results of the comprehensive evidence are awaited (Figure. Figure 33).
Most of the physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in dry environments and for up to 5 days in humidity below 20°C and up to 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes, or 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, paraffinic acid, chloroform, and other fatty disinfectants, but chlorohexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population is usually immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore susceptible to Novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can refer to past studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Normally, when a virus attacks a host, the host's immune system recognizes it through the first type of receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NAD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various mechanisms, the virus stimulates inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of interferon-type I (IFNs), which limits the spread of the virus and its antiviral genetics to accelerate micro-phage fungiativity.
However, the N-hemia of SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including +CD4 and +CD8 play a key role in cell defense.
The T cells of +CD4 stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and the T cells of +CD8 directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis to T cells.
Hormonal immunity including C3a and C5a and antibody supplementation are necessary to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by antibodies isolated from a recovering patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system can lead to a localised buildup of free radicals that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, cause organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by early clustering, and is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have a high number of viruses or whose immune functions are weak, and those who have a high risk of infection are more likely to be infected than others.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 14 to 14 days on average, with a maximum of 7 to 3 days, based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average incubation period ranged from 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a recent study shows that the incubation period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to determine effective quarantine times based on the most appropriate period of growth to prevent people from transmitting the virus to others who are infected but have not shown symptoms.
Typically, people who are infected or have been infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and most frequent initial symptom in COVID-19 is fever, which is accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as, dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat itching, choking, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience respiratory arrest and/or convulsions up to a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and congestion have an immediate improvement.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even with abnormal pulmonary imaging, should be screened for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98% of patients with fever, 76% with dry cough, 55% with respiratory arrest and 3% with diarrhea required ventilation assistance in 8% of patients.
Two recent studies have found similar results about the cause of a cluster in both the household cluster and the asymptomatic individual transition.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV patients also had underlying symptoms of fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory arrest (55%).
However, 80% of these patients required ventilation assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%), and strep throat (21%), were also observed in MERS patients.
It has been proven that fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and sore throat (25-13%) are the main symptoms in SARS patients, and approximately 20-14 percent of patients required ventilation support.
By 14 February, the global death rate from COVID-19 was 2% when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By contrast, the mortality rate of SARS was 10% in 8,096 confirmed cases by November 2002.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study reported that the R0 reproductive range of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 5.71-7.23 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 6.47, whereas the R0 reproductive range of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 compares the symptoms, mortality and reproductive numbers of SARS-CoV-2 with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two viruses.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Often, a swarm starts with a single family or a single gathering or a single boat ride.
Most patients have a history of traveling or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected people or patients in the recent two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for up to two weeks without showing symptoms and patients who recover from hospital can be infected again, which prompts the extension of quarantine time.
These patients had low or no white blood cells at baseline (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L with lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and serum aminotransferase levels and viraemia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of enzymes and myoglobin in the liver and muscle, and most patients had increased levels of C-reactive leukemia and atherosclerotic plaque in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, the blood D-dimer, faharbin, was increased, so the number of lymph sites gradually decreased.
Unusual features in chest radiography of COVID-19 patients are prominent in the lungs with two-sided complex shading or blurring on ground glass.
In most cases, the patient develops generalized pneumonia, severe lung pain, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Respiratory distress syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention and increased fibrosis are largely compromised in gas exchange.
Inactivation of pneumonitis type I and type II reduces the level of the surfactant and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung proliferation and failure.
So, the worst chest X-ray results are parallel to the extreme severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 as in SARS and MERS patients and as in ARDS and viral infection pathology revealed pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and intermediate lymphocyte infiltration, and multicellular synesthesia cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease.
The main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
In China, the use of clinical data for diagnosis (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR) was introduced on 13 February 2020, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the pandemic.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, the medical history, clinical descriptions, laboratory tests, and radiological findings are all needed.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based Sherlock techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which will use a wide range of dip-sticks in detecting synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments from 20x10-18 microliters/liter to 200x10-18 microliters/liter (100-10 copies per microliter for input) in less than an hour without the need for equipment.
It is hoped that if confirmed in clinical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, primary care physicians may provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while also trying different therapies that were previously prescribed or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table2).2)
These treatments include recent and potentially emerging antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychiatric assistance.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and possibly other ACE2-expressing organs such as the stomach and kidneys in small amounts.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the biggest risk and leading cause of death for patients.
Therefore, to help with breathing to alleviate symptoms and save lives, general oxygen, high-flow oxygen, non-interventional ventilation and mechanical intervention ventilation are available depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress may need help with the use of modified cardiopulmonary bypass techniques to treat the risk of fatal heart attack or respiratory failure, through extracorporeal oxygen membrane (ECMO).
Additionally, treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic trauma are necessary to preserve critical organ functions in patients with SARS-CoV-2 for maintenance of electrolight.
It is said that the cytokine stroma results from an over-regulation of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine stream is a type of systemic inflammatory response that is triggered by a sequential release of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines engage immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are a major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary for the treatment of cytokine strokes, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroids and anti-seizoma-acid IL6 molecular antibodies have been used to treat cytokine stroma.
Other immunosuppression treatments of cytokine stroms include: blocked IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibited JAK; kinetic cell suppression 4; and HADC, a directed modification of the T cell of the immune response.
In SARS, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis dramatically affecting diagnosis.
However, short courses of multiple-dose corticosteroids are recommended with caution for patients with severe COVID-19.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, with the intravenous injection of remetesvir in an American patient with COVID-19, nucleotide enzyme was found to be effective.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marilburg viruses.
Later, remetivir was also found to be potentially blocking other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided a mixture of it to China for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur when treated with lopinavir/retonavir in combination.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from this infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or to protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) that help fight pathogenicity and other external things through B-lymphocytes and identify and directly inactivate unique molecules on pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and hypoxia improve within 24 hours.
However, the specific treatment has not yet been developed and needs to be confirmed and defined before it can be recommended for widespread use.
In addition, with treatment effects, some of the risks associated with plasma should be considered.
For example, antibodies enhance the immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal toxin.
Normally, the blood has a lower number of antibodies, and the demand for plasma is higher for treating critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies so quickly to fight a global pandemic.
Isolating B cells from recovering patients and identifying the genetic code to encode effective immunoglobulin to screen for effective antibodies against the virus's imperative leukaemia is a delicate and difficult process.
This way we can speed up the antibody production process.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine to diagnose a disease.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or ambiguous because such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stage.
For example, Zhu Feng Ji Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China saw high rates of improvement in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including Gansu, (63.7%) Nanjing (50%), and Hunan (50%), using traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, while Hubei Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%)
However, this is a rather rigorous comparison, as the impact of this analysis must also include many other factors such as the number of patients and severity.
On February 18, 2020, Bo Li Zheng and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the recovery time, symptom relief, and hospital stay were abnormally short in the Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine group compared to the Western medicine group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatically increased (mild to severe) symptom was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate (8.8% versus 39%) was unusually low.
However, TCM still needs to be tested in more clinical trials and at larger scale to ensure its safety and efficacy.
It will be interesting to highlight the mechanisms of the healing process of traditional Chinese medicine, to explain their effective ingredients or, if possible, their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience fear of highly contagious and even deadly illness, and those in quarantine are more likely to experience boredom, isolation, and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, convulsions, and coughing as well as treatment with corticosteroids can lead to adverse effects such as insomnia, increased anxiety, and stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have reported persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, depression and suicide.
Contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic may make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the fighting, quarantine and stigmatization on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, their contacts, as well as the general public should provide mental health care if needed.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the establishment of clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other, and plans for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its treatment.
Efficient vaccines are needed to prevent the transmission of the virus from susceptible animal representatives to infected human populations, and antiviral therapies are often necessary to control emerging viral epidemics.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on S-liver to generate long-lasting and ventrally-neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity against SARS.
A direct-acting vaccine for SARS was analyzed in animal samples.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting the elderly, lethal challenge specimens and animal virus infections cannot be determined before clinical trials begin.
That's because SARS ended 17 years ago and there have been no new cases.
In contrast, MERS outbreaks continue to occur in regions other than the Middle East where there are persistent animal sources of the virus.
MERS vaccine strategies have been developed using inactivation of the virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recovered subunits of the leukaemia, and some of these have been tested in animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming this challenge is a challenge due to the long time required for vaccine development and dynamic mutation of CoVs (on average 18 months).
COVID-19 has begun to manifest its clinical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients recover without sequelae.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare agencies must create disease diagnosis models to prioritize their services in under-resourced areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or infection of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table33)).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affected people aged 65-30 years, with 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the aforementioned study being over 50 years of age.
Patients with a higher risk of underlying co-morbid complications are more likely to require intensive care, and are older than those without such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51 years), which presents age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Co-infections and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are at risk of severe cardiorespiratory attacks.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive cholangosite of ACE2, which may cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C reactive proteins (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential analytical procedure for treatment response and eventual recovery of this disease.
The correlation of C-reactive leukaemia levels has been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspirated aminotransferase (AST), all-nine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released through tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional markers for heart or liver failure.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient improvement of clinical symptoms should be considered in combination with other tissues for predicting outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, immune suppression of steroids is commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as adjuvant therapy in infectious disease.
Because multiple doses of cartilaginous steroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered lifelong disability and poor quality of life with avascular osteoncerosis.
Therefore, if necessary, very low doses of steroids should be used for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced unusual stress due to enduring prolonged quarantine and witnessing the irrational death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, it appears that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are different from those of SARS.
In addition to entering the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the upper respiratory tract, causing mild or no symptoms as in the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or in the growth phase can produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is critically ill, whereas transmission is not as prevalent in the early stages.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is thus far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is difficult to control.
Currently in China, efforts are underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities and placing the entire population in continuous quarantine.
These measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, but are also causing a decline in the number of new cases, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most welcome thing is that the epidemic will end in March and its secondary swing will be in 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicts that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Eira Longhi et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of a global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that mid turbines and throat swabs from patients recovering from hospital 2 weeks ago indicated they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a precursor to influenza.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, there are promising signs in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
Ebola was originally predicted to have one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is vulnerable to disease and eventually dies out or survives in humans as a less virulent virus.
The following figure provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with a virus-contaminated substance.
The virus is also found in the stool, creating a new possibility of transmission from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 percent of the cases were due to a possible non-neurological infection, including 17 patients with a pre-existing disease and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those who come into contact with patients or those who are infected, should exercise extreme caution.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series #1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces, where they can reach others.
However, only the N95 (serial #1860) mask can prevent the inhalation of small viral particles from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viral particles can fully penetrate, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both are about 85 nm.
Even if five surgical masks are tied together, the particles can still penetrate them, so healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial #1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear an isolation gown to reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus likely entered through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear clear face shields or goggles when working with patients.
It is highly recommended that people in affected or potentially affected areas wash their hands more often with disinfectant soap, self-quarantine at home, and try to limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet away from the patient is considered the appropriate distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, it is a high-profile homologue of SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, and should be a cause of high alert for China based on the profound memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human contagion and limited reproductive capacity and that preventing and controlling the disease is not a problem.
The message significantly eased public alarm, especially as they prepared for the Spring Festival, and the time was lost to contain the disease in Wuhan to a lesser extent.
The disease control agencies in China may have learned from this difficult situation and made significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be sensitive and responsive to clinical triviality rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or staff; (3) restrict control of a potential outbreak in its early stages rather than providing relief to the public; and (4) use targeted and impactful practices to increase public awareness of epidemics frequently and periodically to test and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
As of this writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created the perception of a SARS re-outbreak.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more than youth and men more than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older adults than youth.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are critically ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively more rapidly and widely spread than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have a regular RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several key issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent genetic homogeneity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Who was the original agent, from bats, the intermediate species for transmission of the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and #2, we cannot effectively slow the transmission process and it could re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with this ACE2, how does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and what pathological changes does it result in?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs
Without the right answers to these questions, we can't get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this plague last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during its migration to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end like SARS or be periodic like the common cold?
This is important but it may take some time to find answers to the questions above and some others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
The animal origin of human coronaviruses
Over thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host organisms, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been the coin toss to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 again highlighted CoVs and surprised us with its faster transmission and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-to-human infection and this serves us to understand the animal origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known as intermediate host organisms of reservoirs.
Identify animal hosts that have a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of the CoV-host organism in animals provides important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a review of the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on their animal origins and mixed-species transmission, as well as their discovery history.
Importantly, we compare and distinguish different HCoVs from the evolutionary and genetic maintenance perspectives of different viruses.
In this context, the current pandemic of COVID-19 will be discussed.
In addition, the implications of viral resistance on the mutation requirements of successful host organisms and the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of enveloped, sensory-positive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which used large genomes such as 26 to 32 kB between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" due to the appearance of crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undifferentiated genes, sharing a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames ((ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polymorphism map of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polymerase acts on another 16 non-structural polymers, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of genetics includes ORFs for structural membranes, including the tipical (S), membranous (E), membranous (M) and nucleolar (N) membranes.
A number of specific sequence supporting proteins are also encoded by different sequence CoVs.
Based on variation in the strain configurations, CoVs are classified into four genera (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV), with the Beta-CoV genus consisting mostly of HCoVs and further divided into lineages (A,B,C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that, most bats and mice are the source of genome of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some of them have emerged as major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild cold and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations in relatively more patients.
In the mid-1960s, strains of HCoV-229E, B814 isolated nasal discharge from patients with minor colds.
Since then, more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, before the outbreak of SARS, it was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was usually harmless.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 is the most devastating in recent history, with the disease infecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a permanent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The source animals for all seven HCoVs are bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support that all HCoVs have an evolutionary origin from bats, where viruses are well adapted and exhibit non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, the strength of the outbreak, and the factors constraining transmission in different species.
This could also aid or guide the search for host hosts, intermediates and hosts of SARA-CoV-2 with important implications for preventing future recurrences.
In this review, we will provide an overview of the source animals, mixed translocation and pathogenetics of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common idea that paternal viruses of HCoVs are normally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir host organisms and become pathogenic after migration to their new host organism.
We also examine the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, which often increase transmission with a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcomes of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
The first isolated strain B814 of HCoV-229E, nasal discharge from patients with the common cold, was isolated from various animals infected with different CoVs including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the date of discovery of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
In 10 to 20% of cases of patients infected with HCoV-229E, mild cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, restlessness and sore throat with fever and cough have been reported.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently introduced into the brain of small rats in a serial way.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of those who have had HCoV-229E, which do not differ symptomatically from other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were distributed globally, and they are more prevalent in temperate climates during winter.
Typically, the incubation period for both of these viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about two weeks.
According to human volunteer studies, infection with HCoV-229E in healthy individuals causes mild colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was the first well-documented global pandemic caused by HCoVs in human history and SARS-CoV is the etiologic agent, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Zhuangdong province.
The SARS epidemic that spread across many countries and continents resulted in 774 deaths and 8,096 cases.
In addition to rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of illness at the viral load threshold, could increase by about two secondary cases.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of muscle aches, headaches, fever, anxiety and colds, followed by symptoms of late-onset dyspnea, cough, and shortness of breath.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function and some elevated creatinine kinase are common in uncommon laboratory tests for SARS.
Disseminated ovarian damage, epithelial cell proliferation and proliferation of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can be affected, usually with cytokine strokes, which can be fatal, especially in patients with compromised immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient, who had travelled to Hong Kong from Zhuangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCov-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands during late 2004.
It is initially found in young children, the elderly, and in patients with compromised immune systems with respiratory disease.
Inflammation of the nasal membrane, nasal congestion, bronchitis and inflammation of the nasal passages are common in the disease caused by HCoV-BL63.
Another independent study was described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of the general respiratory illness, and symptoms are severe in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with whooping cough, also known as crap.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong who was hospitalized with pneumonia and inflammation of the nasal cavity.
HCoV-HKU1 associated with severe asthma, with community-acquired pneumonia and inflammation of the bronchial duct, was reported.
Similarly HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which causes mild respiratory illness, were found worldwide.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are highly compatible with humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic disease, although incidents have occurred for unknown reasons, as in the case of the more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63 that caused severe lower respiratory tract infection, recently reported in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to spread and persist within humans, they become mildly pathogenic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient from Saudi Arabia who had severe pneumonia and renal impairment.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases are found in the Middle East, and occasionally imported cases with secondary spread in close contacts are found in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a secondary outbreak broke out in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which has advanced severe pneumonia characteristics.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS develop severe renal failure, which is very unique to MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30 percent of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, over 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases resulted in 34.4% deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses found in humans.
During mid-to-late December 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were last detected from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a global public health emergency of global concern, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated having died.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the mortality rate is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been reported in some patients.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia, and it can increase the severity of respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to a continuous similarity in 82% of the upper nucleotide, it is a cluster of different branches of the pathogenetic tree.
The virus of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic subjects reported symptoms that may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Many interesting similarities and differences emerge in the comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs.
First, HCoVs are very similar in the duration and frequency of disease development.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the other four community-acquired (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has been commonly observed to exhibit its infectious characteristics during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infections, although this proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits interesting characteristics similar to community-derived HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after entry into humans.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples, as can other HCoVs.
Although at least some cases that remain to be clarified in future studies are whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in oral fecal transmission, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 will be seasonal, as is the case with community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 after entry into humans including its transmissibility, pathogenesis and sustained spread will influence the ultimate outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms, adapting well in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, both strains may be survivors of the global pandemic of ancient HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that are susceptible to severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To do so, HCoVs that accumulate the mutation must be replicated in humans to withstand the restriction of the host organism to a sufficient extent and to adapt to the mutation.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is that humans will fully adopt it.
If it is properly adopted, then it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing the common cold in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses don't need animal reservoirs.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and cannot sustain transmission to humans.
They need to grow and reproduce in their animal reservoirs, and potentially find a chance to spread through one or more intermediate and expanding host organisms to sensitive human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs.
At least for now, it is more transmissible than community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will fully embrace it and it will circulate in humans without any reservoirs or intermediate hosts.
Before discussing the origin of HCoVs organisms, it would be useful to discuss the evolution, nature, reservoirs, intermediate and extensive determination and characteristics of the host animals of HCoVs.
The animal, if it has a closely related ethnographic contribution, serves as an evolutionary host organism for HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Ethno-virus usually adapts well to this host organism and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host organism shelters HCoVs continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host organisms are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host organism at or before introduction to humans, it is unable to adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host organism can act as the animal source of human infection and then act as the host that accelerates the spread of human infection to humans on a large scale.
If HCoVs cannot maintain transmission within the intermediate host organism, it will move into a closed path of infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host organism and even establish long-term nutrition.
In this case, the intermediate host organism becomes the host organism of the natural reservoir.
Epidemic data has disappointingly revealed that the index cases of SARS have a history of contact with sport animals.
Subsequent non-spread investigation showed that the antagonist SARS-CoV lgG was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
The first to be identified in the live animal market were masked palm civet cats (Pygoma larvae) and a raccoon dog with SARS-CoV-like viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly confirms that no SARS was reported after all the Sewet cats in the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that masked cats from the forest or fields were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearing in the live animal market, suggesting that the masked cats may only have been acting as a potentially expansive intermediate host organism but not a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Zhengzhou have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that several small mammals could serve as extensive intermediate host organisms of SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be SARS-infected host organisms.
The search for a natural animal host of SARS-CoV has resulted in the detection of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolephus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse-tailed bat.
These mites are positive for the antagonist-SARS-CoV antibody and are the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have established the new concept that bats are host organisms for human pathogenetics.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none can be isolated as a living virus except for one designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from leopard waste samples was demonstrated to be used as a cell receptor for ACE2 in bats, cat seals and humans.
Interestingly, recovered SARS patients from Sierra were able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest approximation of SARS-CoV related to bat lineage, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host organisms of SARS-CoV.
The same group of MERS-CoVs were clustered as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5, phylogenetically analysed.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same representative receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS identified from Europe and Africa is polygenetically closer to the counterparts in Bt-CoV.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, bats cannot be the host organism of the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels in several African countries, as well as camels in the Middle East, are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies in camels with a cuban.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of a camel with a cobra, further indicating that camels serve as reservoirs of the true host organism of MERS-CoV.
Notably, experimentally infected MERS-CoV camels were observed to have generally mild symptoms but large-scale viral outbreaks.
Specifically, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of transmission from bats.
However, questions remain as several confirmed cases of MERS before the onset of symptoms have no history of being related to camels, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species, which harbour MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 CoV isolated from the Raeolus bat shared 96.2% of nucleotide similarity with the RaT13 bat.
As with the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good for assigning sequence.
That is to say, the bat cannot be the host organism of the live reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 until a near-matched bat CoV is found in the future.
Presumably, the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which has been associated with many early cases of COVID-19 and which may indicate animal-to-human transmission, will be the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife species being sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Mans Javanica) may also be host to SARS-CoV-2 related ancestral B-ta CoVs.
These novel pangolin CoV genes share between 85% and 92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
These are clusters of subgenome-like subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which shares the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 with a %97.4 amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of continuous genetic similarity, are more diverse.
Previous studies of the diseased pegulin reported the presence of viral macrophages, which are similar to the related SARS-CoV-2, from lung samples.
The study used partial genetic sequencing, which is approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome, using various assembly methods and manual safeguards.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission from pangolin source due to the sequence difference between pangolin SARS-CoV-2's beta CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
The best sequence similarity has been found in the receptor-binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARA-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, while SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broad genetic sequence similarity.
It is highly speculative that the high-level similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and pegylen SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs in the receptor-binding domain is driven by selective mediation through careful evolution.
A counter-proposal has been proposed in favour of recombination between beta-CoVs and RaTG13 related to pangolin SARA-CoV-2 in the third wild animal strain.
The large-scale recombination spread between beta-CoVs is present as a driving force in evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be of animal origin.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be the original source bat CoVs, while the ancestor viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian ridge coev) in the Trange bat of North America has shown a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV termed hyposidrosis/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and is suspected to be its intermediate host organism in camels.
For illustration, the current knowledge about the animal origins of the identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure1 and Table2.
Phylogenetic analyses have provided evidence of transmission events of mixed strains of HCoVs in history.
A global epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded around 1890 when domestic live stock HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans.
The history of mixed-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Multiple lines of evidence support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in the shared ecological niche, bats may be interacting with humans, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the related bat-alpha CoVs to HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in the bat, while the alpaca-alpha CoV is responsible for respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha CoVs from humans.
In fact, human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nepah virus and Handra virus, are directly transmitted by bats.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha CoVs act as the genetic pool of an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels may act as intermediates, just like the cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV serves as the best example of mixed species transmission from bats to monobranch camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by later findings.
Apparently, bats provide a rich pool of viral strains for the transfer and exchange of genetic fragments and transnational species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong flight capability are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in camels with a camel for decades.
It has adapted well in camels that have been transformed from direct hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild disease and relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident and humans are the host organisms blocked from MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, is different in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangolin B-ta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be host organisms that are closed-loop for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, which is similar to the coyote cat in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out multiple possibilities for mixed-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bat SARS-CoV-2 which is almost identical to the virus SARS-CoV-2 may be the source of the host organism.
Humans share the ecological niche with bats through butchery or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the fast intermediate host organisms, in which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has been newly introduced.
Humans have been known to get close to the virus through hunting and hunting.
It is possible that a number of mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in both domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as described above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may arise in tertiary species that have contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the host animal variety, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First of all, they have relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other isolated RNA viruses, the determined mutation rate of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with the mean annual mutation rate at each site ranging from 2 to 10-4 mutations, depending on the stage of adaptation of the novel host organism to the CoV.
CoVs have proofreading exocrine glands, which, when deleted, result in a more highly mutable, attention-grabbing, even uncontainable strain.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remedicivir is known to suppress the replication of CoVs by inhibiting these exogenous vesicles and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is the highly intelligent agent being tested as the antagonist SARA-CoV-2 in clinical practice.
However, CoVs have a mutation rate that is over a million times higher than that of their host organisms.
In addition, most cases where CoVs cannot adapt well to the host organism, the mutation rate is high.
Compared to the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, the well-adapted SARA-CoV-2 apparently has a low mutation rate in humans.
It's probably already adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which adapts well to single-caste camels, is also affected.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the enhanced genes would render vaccines and antivirals immediately ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the genetics in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional modulation in genetic modification for large RNA mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of cross-species mutation, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by the decoding of several unique reading frames and leucine functions towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often switch randomly between RNA motifs through the unique mechanism of "copy selection".
During CoV RNA replication, the host organism that acts as the admixture, the membrane, is frequently modified.
Full-length and subgenetic RNAs of the extreme homologs may be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural combination of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related host-organism communication of the virus
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host organism receptor is the main factor in influential and mixed-species transmission.
With this, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which gave evidence of positive selection during mixed-species translocation.
In addition to the comparative analysis of isolating human and avian SARS-CoVs, there is a concept of rapid adaptation of SARS-CoVs to different host organisms, particularly with the variation of the S-lactam receptor binding domain.
Typically, the receptor binding domain in the S-layer of the CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively selected by the antibody response of the host organism.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 fragment is 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The ACE2 receptor for the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain is able to identify the receptor that allows for mixed-species transmission of the virus in various animals, including bats, civet cats, mice and raccoon dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in human and Sioux cat isolated viruses, 4 of them are found in the form of receptor binding to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which may enhance the interaction of the tip of the tip with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids could be the key sub-alternatives for viral adaptation in humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit of the S strain indicates that the essential affinity of its S strain with human ACE2 may be altered.
Indeed, a refractive electron microscopy study is suggesting this association is -10 to -20 times greater than the association between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-lathemia.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other sub-receptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a different subset of S.
Many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43 are present here.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs after their mixed-species animal-to-human migration.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoV mixed-genotype transcription is monitored, depending on another host organism and through binding factors.
The spread of these host strains between humans and hosts with natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as bats, camels with a single hump, and rats, may hinder mixed-species transmission.
HCoVs have both enraged host organism-dependent factors and disruptive host organism-binding factors for a successful mixed-species transmission.
In this regard, the molecular identity and characterization of this important part of the interaction of the virus with the host organism remains to be determined.
The host-dependent and neutral wide genetic screening of binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from the use of the state-of-the-art CRISPR technology.
Novel HCoVs released: return to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also serve as two key steps in the evolutionary progression of HCoVs.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a nuclear epidermal coding gene leads to the ability to rapidly change the viral phenotype.
In the helper enzyme of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered to be important in human adaptation, as was isolating SARS-CoV related bat viruses but found the ORF8 enzyme to be encoded differently.
SARS-CoV-29, a nucleotide-terminating strain isolated early in the human epidemic, has been characterized.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is a conformational mutation that promotes translocation in host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where small regions of RNA polymerase-dependent RNA recombinase in large numbers were identified.
The rearrangement sites were identified at nsp9, mostly nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV outbreak, which occurred in a camel with a cocoon in Saudi Arabia, has experienced recombination events between different strains.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of recombination have been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs with their own unstructured genetics.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unannounced changes in viral genetics, possibly as a result of selective pressure evasion, such as the host's immune system, getting rid of the virus.
An example of this effect is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229 E, which causes two nucleotides to be deleted.
Although persistence of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the entry of Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressures in their reservoir host organisms.
When bats are infected with CoVs, an asymptomatic or mild symptom is detected, indicating an interplay between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in activating pro-inflammatory responses in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and large histiocompatibility complex class I inhibitors that inhibit natural killer cell activity in bats are suppressed due to low levels of expression.
Furthermore, reactivation of oxygen species (ROS) high levels generated by bat metabolism activity suppressing replication of both CoVs, and by influencing proofreading via excori-buncles to produce highly pathogenic virus strains, provide selective suppression when a new host organism is introduced.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be produced through recombination, which allows the host organism to grow to acquire novel melanocytes or melanocytes properties.
So, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their host organisms such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without the host's strong immune response.
It hides the secrets of why asymptomatic vectors appear and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyper-activity of the immune response and cytokine stroma, which cause a stronger immune response, with more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in an asymptomatic carrier, the immune response has been de-coupled by the replication of CoV.
The same strategy of decoupling the immune response has a beneficial effect in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen.
The reaction of interferon is particularly potent in bats.
Therefore, interferon organization of type I should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory function of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
Therefore, it may be beneficial to perform NLRP3 inflammatory prevention with MCC950 in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emission of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that emerged from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat beta-CoV was found to share 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV that is found to share 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While the swine and other animals in the mangroves have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, the direct intermediate host organism of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin Bta CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that pangolins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or that pangolin Bta-CoVs may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragmentation.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have resurfaced due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our ideas about animal sources and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
The extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via an intermediate host organism.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and cats in markets, the SARS epidemic could be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing cats.
Therefore, given the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin Bta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future investigations are yet to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in camels for a long time.
For the locals, these camels serve as the primary source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as a major means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, as was done in some Chinese markets to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, they can cause new genetic variants to emerge.
In the wild, animal coronaviruses are circulating.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal variants are very diverse.
As a result of the release of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to evolve and recover.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 tests, better preparedness and response plans should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many features that cause the spread of viruses, the chances of human exposure to bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are educated.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the CoV and its natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the animal-to-human transmission of the disease and its future spread.
Consequently, by moving humans away from the environmental niche of natural reservoirs of animal-to-human disease viruses, viral transmission of animal-to-human diseases can be prevented more effectively.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 origin animal puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit a lineage virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins might share the same ecological power.
If, second, bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then we need to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediary, it must explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, because many other mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing for infection should be conducted.
If bats, pangolins or any other mammals are present, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural representatives.
Continued field investigations will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans, as well as clarifying the evolutionary journey of SARS-Cov-2 in animals.
Diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 must be renewed
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Consultation Guide for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic spread across the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease, our awareness and knowledge of which is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, that provide the most up-to-date diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (version 7).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred.
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge of it is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a diagnostic and treatment guide for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with a total of seven issues released from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in the context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al, who suggested a simple scoring based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for this global pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge and thank them for their outstanding work.
However, their work also needs to be updated to reflect the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis combining any one feature of the epidemiological history with two items of clinical explanation is required to confirm a suspect case, or three items of clinical explanation without a clear epidemiological history are required to combine:
History of outbreaks: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) History of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) History of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in a small area such as home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceptual features of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell counts at the early onset stage showing normal, decreasing, or low lymphocyte counts.
Pathological genetic or serological evidence should be diagnosed as a confirmed case over a suspected case with one of the following items: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole viral genome sequencing showing high sequence of known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgM antibody and lgG antibody; or negative negative negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgG antibody or ≥4 times the increase in tyres in the acute phase of the recovery phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
Detection of pathogens in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
The probe-based modification work is ongoing to find the most nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis in the confirmed criteria, as well as to take respiratory tract including blood samples that increase the availability of different samples, and help bring positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there is much more evidence to remind us to be cautious with traditional symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
So, Zoot al. 's flow chart should be refreshed, because they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
Consequently, we hope for more direct evidence to come and ask readers to offer their opinions.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we advise them to identify and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team updates our guide in a timely manner to offer support.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest in a single day
On the previous day, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who had stayed at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In details in an online news, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjedi Sabrina Flora said the fatalities included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mir Jade, two cases were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, the director of Bengal anti-corruption, who was treated at Kuwait's Mitra Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Abid al-Qadir, said that public transport will be shut down for a long period of time from this coming week, under initial planning.
The initial public transportation shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
On 8 March, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were reported in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed one million infections globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, the disease that is caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries that is still free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the WHO reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 24 hours as of 10:00 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
The United States has recorded more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, linked to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 Americans had died from coronavirus infections as of Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stringent measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to Russians without work would continue until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extends curfew for the entire day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: Previously, the curfew was in effect from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike Devine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Toilet tissue paper limit in Australian stores reduced every transaction
On Sundays and weekends, Australian retail chains Walworth and Coyle's gradually reduced toilet tissue paper purchase restrictions nationally across all stores to two and one pack per transaction.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on the chain's check-outs, and Facebook pages.
There were reports of shoppers storing it in case people needed self-isolation due to COVID-19 fears.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the purchase of toilet tissue paper to one pack per order for home delivery.
The changes follow the previous four-pack-per-transaction restrictions introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, said that with the ban on four packs in one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery", and the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworth's spokesman, sales in the last week have "increased dramatically".
Costco's store in Canberra also reduced the number of permitted packs to two last week.
To alleviate the shortage, Cooles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworth ordered additional stockpiles, while ADLI planned to stockpile for special early availability on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase inventory, but delivery truck timing restrictions by local councils have made it difficult.
They also have rising production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock discount, some stores could not operate certain Wednesdays.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said in a News.com.au report that stores are filling up at night every day.
He said that toilet tissue paper is a big item, which means it's a small quantity in storage, and, when sold, it leaves a huge shelf space empty, which creates a sense of severe scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News, "The Coils and Woolworths review is that if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitiser can be bought and if it's in quantity, maybe you can reduce panic.
A giant manufacturer of recycled toilet tissue said last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly Clark, who makes Cleans toilet tissue, and Solaris, who makes surfaces, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some Melbourne property sellers offer free toilet tissue to the first bidder at the auction, with some auctions taking place when buyers had time off due to the long weekend on International Workers' Day.
The NT News Thursday edition of the Darwin daily added eight pages of links meant to be cut up and used as toilet tissue.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to impose the restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce a ban on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman also said that other products, including masks, sanitary, dry goods, hand washers and flour, are also in high demand.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, British supermarkets were observed limiting their purchases to packs of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing spread of COVID-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a global pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous some specific cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for governments to take action.
All countries can also change the course of this global pandemic.
If countries respond by tracking, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing their people.
We are very concerned about both the dimensions of this disease, the speed and severity of its spread and the alarming scope of the response to it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In his remarks published in CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus, except influenza, has been found to have such a sequence from its inception to its global spread".
Gaibriss echoed this sentiment, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic that has been preceded by a coronavirus".
He went on to say, "And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled in one go".
The new status of the pandemic followed the announcement of the World Health Organization's decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The important thing is that it is heading for a catastrophe".
The Associated Press reports that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide reached 126,000 as of Thursday, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The current ongoing pandemic of 2019-20 coronavirus is a variant of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and identified as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and symptoms of severe difficulty breathing.
The period from onset to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive - recommended precautions include hand-to-mouth contact, mouth-to-mouth contact, social distancing, and monitoring and isolation for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have also been advocating the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused disruptions in many global socio-economic, economic, religious, political and cultural events and widespread shortages of goods due to rampant shopping.
Schools and universities in countries closed either nationally or locally, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's 193 student population.
Misinformation about the virus spread online, and there were instances of prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, people of other East and Southeast Asian races, and those who had been the most affected by the virus.
Low traffic and the closure of major industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were from the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus is from a zoonotic strain.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The first person to be diagnosed with symptoms of the disease was diagnosed on 1 December 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the male Marchhead.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in December 2019 were market-related.
On 13 March 2020, South China Morning Post in an unconfirmed report suggested that the case of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019 may be the first.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although cases in China are decreasing, due to a sudden rise in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases from China exceeded new cases within China for the first time.
It is also possible to underestimate the number of cases, especially in people with common symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, representing 2.4% of cases globally.Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be affected before effective crowd control could be achieved.
According to official protocol, cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and it is official policy in many countries not to test only people with mild symptoms, as was done in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March reported that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were undetectable as of 23 January and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimated baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't, the time between onset of symptoms and death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
As of 5 February, about 80% of deaths in China were people over 60 years old and 75% of people had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic is generally those who tested positive for COVID-19 according to official protocol.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because these deaths do not include those who die without testing - for example, at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths by a factor of 4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know that [the reported death toll] has been underreported", confirming reports of underreporting deaths in the U.S. Such underreporting is common during pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed case of death in Wuhan occurred on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and regions have reported deaths from every continent except the South Pacific. Several common measures are used to determine deaths.
This number varies with region and time, and is influenced by testing, the quality of treatment systems, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The incidence-death ratio is obtained by dividing the number of deaths in a given period by the number of diagnosed cases.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-incidence ratio as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The case-to-death ratio in China (for people from onset of symptoms as of 1-10 January 2020) has decreased from 17.3% to 0.7% (for people from onset of disease as of 1 February 2020) - other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die, and the infection death rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people (undiagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These numbers are not for a specific time and are for a specific population from infection to final resolution.
Several experts have tried to calculate this number for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection mortality rate in this pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the global pandemic is controllable.
The peak and terminal duration of the epidemic are varied and uncertain by location.
McKidge Boney of Penn State University said, "If unchecked, the outbreaks typically rise like a plateau and then begin to decline when the disease no longer finds hosts.
But it's impossible to make any reasonable plan now about when that's going to happen".
"It could be over by June", stressed Zong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, "if all countries are encouraged to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to contain the spread of the virus".
On 17 March, Adam K. Charsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to circulate for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (probably 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will be completely gone because it's easily transmissible" and it will "become a seasonal disease, and it will come back every year".
The return loss will depend on the reduction of the Afrini crowd and its variability.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unobserved and infected people may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include wheezing, a buildup of mucus in the throat (bulging), loss of the ability to breathe, shortness of breath, pain in the hips and joints, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, coughing up blood, diarrhea or blue throat. The World Health Organization reports that about one person in four becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as: shortness of breath, recurrent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and facial or lip numbness; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, body rot, blood clots, and death.
Some of these infected people may be asymptomatic, they may be confirmed patients without clinical symptoms, so researchers continue to recommend that people who come in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's asymptomatic disease ratio ranges from a few figures to 44%.
The incubation period (median time between infection and onset of symptoms) is usually one to 14 days; it is usually five days.For example, the loss of the sense of smell in people infected with COVID-19+ was initially in 30% of people, but later decreased to 15% of people.
The details of how the disease develops are still being clarified.
It is thought to be initially spread by close contact and by small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; where the distance between close contact is 1 or 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that the non-dhunappe Khaansi can jump from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be spread by airborne droplets that remain in the air for extended periods of time, which are formed during speech. Exhaled breathing droplets can also be produced during breathing, including during conversation, although the virus is not normally airborne.
These droplets can be absorbed into the mouth or nose of nearby people, or possibly into the lungs when breathing.
Some medical procedures such as a feeding tube and artificial mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (CPR) can expel the respiratory fluids and thus disperse them into the air.
It can also appear when a person rubs on the affected surface and then rubs on their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it could spread through the faces, the risk is considered to be very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal discharge.The virus is highly contagious for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, although infection is possible both before symptoms and in the late stage of the disease.
Since people can test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission of the disease is possible before the onset of symptoms.
There have been only a few laboratory-confirmed cases reported where no symptoms of the disease were present, but in some countries asymptomatic transmission has been detected during the investigation of the link.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can typically infect two to three people - the virus can survive on different surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, this period varies with humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, however, British authorities advise hand-washing after contact with animals, as they do when contacting other surfaces that have been touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia who belonged to the acute respiratory syndrome group in Wuhan city.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed to have originated from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the family of lineage B tocoronaviruses, with Bta coronavirus (lineage B) derived from two bat strains in the subfamily.
On the overall genome level, it has a 96% similarity to the other bat coronavirus strain (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid is found in the genome sequence of humans and pangolin viruses in a few parts of the genome.
Full genome comparisons to date have revealed that as much as 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
The provisional diagnosis of infection with the virus can be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from the infected fluid or an ICT X-ray is ultimately done via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to CT showed that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its reflex characteristics are dominant in other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as a primary radiation test for COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test simultaneously uses the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually done by an IV, although a throat IV may also be used - several laboratories and companies have developed immunoassay tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be valid enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Celux in the US has been approved for emergency use only in authorized laboratories.
Characteristics of the radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images of people with symptoms of this disease include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent excessive flow.
The Italian Radiology Society is building an international online database of the imaging results of certified cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging detection of COVID-19 without PCR validation is of limited utility.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR, showing that although imaging for infection is less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, with suggestions that it should be considered for use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were created to detect the virus's characteristics through both radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, handless eye, nose or mouth cleansing, and tissue washing and spitting, and direct disposal of tissue in the waste bin.
People who have already contracted the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission of the disease - several countries have restricted travel or have banned non-essential travel to other countries or regions affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached a point of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community members do not know how or where they have been infected - healthcare workers who are suspected of being infected are advised to take standard precautions about contact and eye protection - tracing contacts is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by governments using mobile phone data for this purpose, and Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented or recommended voluntary use, with over a dozen groups working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to access user's location from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if they have been in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are being circulated regarding the prevention of infection; for example, pouring water into the nose and rinsing with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although several agencies are working on one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for up to 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dry; before washing; and after someone has brushed their nose, coughed, or sniffed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap when its protective shield is broken.
The CDC further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their ears, nose, or mouth with non-woven hands.
Surfaces should also be disinfected in several ways (stainless steel surface exposed to a disinfectant for one minute), including 62-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% to 7.5% poivodone-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexoderic gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case occurs in a location, such as an office or a nursery, all areas - offices, toilets, shared toilets, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths with their folded elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing and destroy such tissue immediately.
The use of surgical masks is recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask limits both the volume and the distance travelled by the affected person's discharge droplets, when he or she talks, sneezes, and coughs.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to University of Leeds virologist, Stephen Griffin, "Wearing a mask can reduce the likelihood of people touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if not handled with proper hygiene". Mask use is also recommended for those who are in the care of an infected person.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear a mask only if they are in serious danger to their health, such as when treating someone with COVID-19, although they acknowledge that wearing a mask prevents people from rubbing their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the public to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric; China specifically recommends that healthy people in the public wear disposable medical masks, especially when they are likely to be in close proximity to other people (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wear them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone must wear a mask when entering a convenience store.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, also requires passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask when going outdoors, while at home, it is recommended to prepare masks for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes disease control actions that aim to reduce the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping centers.
People can implement social distancing practices by staying at home, avoiding going out in crowds, not receiving greetings, and staying physically distant from each other.
Many governments are enforcing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum crowd recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (where the area did not have any known cases of COVID-19), to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.The elderly and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and weakened immune systems may face severe illness and complications, and have been advised by the CDC to stay home longer due to the outbreak in the community.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the purpose is to limit social contact while maintaining social contacts, either physically or by maintaining physical distance.
The term social distancing has come to imply that people should be isolated from the world entirely, rather than encouraged to interact with other people in alternative ways.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidance during the pandemic.
They also include recommendations to only have sex with their partner who has no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended that the entire population in an affected area undergo self-isolation.
The self-imposed quarantine has issued the strictest guidelines for those in the high-risk group.
People who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an epidemic are prevention, control or suppression and mitigation.
Control strategies are developed in the early stages of an outbreak and aim to identify and isolate infected people, introduce other infection control measures, and vaccinate to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When the disease is no longer contained, the effort enters the mitigation phase: measures are taken to reduce its spread and its impact on health care systems and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures, both combined, should be taken at the same time.
More drastic measures are needed to curb the global pandemic, bringing the primary prevalence ratio back to less than 1. Part of managing the spread of infectious diseases is to try to slow the rise of the epidemic, called curbing the spread of the epidemic.
It reduces the burden on health services, which are becoming overwhelmed, and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical measures that can manage the spread of the epidemic include precautionary measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling social events; involving the community to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as cleaning up the surface - the same measures that were taken in China to prevent the epidemic, once the severity of the epidemic was revealed, to quarantine entire cities and impose strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed mass screening and localised quarantine and issued warnings on the movement of those affected.
Singapore provided financial support to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and authorized stockpiling of medical supplies.The UK and US parallels show that mitigation (reducing the spread of the pandemic but not ending it) and containment (growing global pandemic) are major challenges.
Overly mitigating policies can reduce the rise in health care demand by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but they can still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelm the health system.
Suppression may be preferred as a transitional measure but must be continued as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is earlier) otherwise it will return to recovery quickly once measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have a social and economic cost.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop one, including trials of existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold medication, drinking plenty of water and resting helps to eliminate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygenation, intravenous injection, and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can worsen the outcome.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that "some traditional and household items" may ease SARS-CoV-19 infections.
Increasing the capacity and adaptability of healthcare providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in the pandemic response.
The CDC and WHO Regional EU Office have issued guidance for hospitals and primary healthcare facilities to transition resources in several phases, including focusing on laboratory services' ability to test for COVID-19, abandoning voluntary procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many theories as to where the first case (the zero patient) started.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to slowly rise.
Most of these cases are attributed to the wholesale sea market in Hunan, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus originated from this type of animal; in other words, the virus is descended from animal diseases. The cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Xiejian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to Wuhan Xi'an CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Central Wuhan Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors and one, Ai Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading false information.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
By early January, enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to Wuhan health authorities to warrant an investigation; in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, with transportation playing a key role for Chinese New Year as Wuhan was the main interchange for transportation and rail.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms of the disease by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the country with the most confirmed cases globally. As of 9 April 2020, there are more than 1.61 million cases reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 are recovering.
There has been at least one incident in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the globalization in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and have introduced border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantines (called stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.Almost 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, are currently in some form of lockdown as of April 2, over 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were locked down in some form, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later, or about one-third of the world's population.
The first case of the COVID-19 virus was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report reported the first case on 17 November.

Screening procedures include international travellers coming in via mobile apps, in-car testing for the virus with results available the next day, mandatory self-reporting of symptoms, and the ability to test up to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program to contain the outbreak is considered a success despite not quarantining all cities. South Korean society initially criticized President Moon's response to the outbreak.

WHO commended the Chinese authorities' efforts to contain and manage the pandemic.
The WHO noted the contrast with the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of covering up the case which disrupted prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has "provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
In response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan on 23 January, WHO representative Gaudin Galle said that while there was "no recommendation from the WHO" in this regard, "this is an important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it has been most prevalent" and "an unprecedented event in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the disease was confirmed to be transmitted from person to person outside of China, and due to the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), a PIC of a type that only began during the 2009 global influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was "due to the risk of a global pandemic, especially for low and middle-income countries that lack robust health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that measures that "unduly interfere with global travel and trade" were not needed, and that the World Health Organization advised "restricted trade and movement".

On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated with China to provide international and WHO experts with domestic organization support on the Chinese mainland and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and "visiting areas to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural locations" on 25 February, the World Health Organization declared that "the world should do more to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak", stating that although it would be too early to call the disease a pandemic, countries should still be in the "preparation phase" of the global pandemic.

Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Emergency Plan, warned in a statement that "this is a real think tank for every government on the planet: wake up.
The virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared", stressing that the right responses can help save the world from "its worst".
Ryan added that current data do not allow public health officials to declare the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we are fundamentally recognizing that every human being on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization officially declared the coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned both at the alarming levels of the spread and severity of the disease and the lack of an adequate response".The WHO has faced considerable criticism for its apparent inadequacy in responding to the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a global pandemic.

Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places including tourist centers, and travel restrictions by governments globally.
As a result, several airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flybehi also fell from the top.
The impact on the cruise industry was unprecedented.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season associated with Chinese New Year holidays.
A number of events, which were expected to draw large crowds, were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year celebrations, with private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional Dome Fair, were closed to avoid crowds.
Municipal and regional officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces extended New Year's holidays to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to the infectious disease to its highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's events.The global retail sector was affected by the reduction of store hours or temporary closures.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America has dropped by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw 50-60% of their sales fall.
This reduced the number of people walking to shopping centers in March by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global pandemic-induced recession could have pushed an additional 14 to 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty in the absence of the global pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
About 300 million rural Chinese migrants have become either trapped in remote provincial homes or landed in Hubei Province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans became unemployed and applied for government assistance.
An estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that the coronavirus disease could cost 47 million in the US and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.Lakhs of workers (day-wage earners) have been unemployed due to lockdowns in India.A survey by the Ingus Reader Institute found that 44% of domestic Canadians have been unemployed in some way.In mid-March 2020, nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. In Germany, about half a million companies gave their workers a government-sponsored short-term work scheme called Kurzerbitt.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The global arts and heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, impacting the operations of institutions as well as individuals, including both employed and self-employed.
The arts and culture sector organisations tried to uphold their missions (which are often publicly supported) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to protect their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events, and events were cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been numerous efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and most acute failure of the disease has been the cancellation of religious services, major church events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also faced a setback.The Vatican announced that Holy Saturday in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian season of Lent, was cancelled.
Many pastors advised older Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches began broadcasting church services via radio, live TV or online, while others held services in a car.
As the Roman Catholic clergy in Rome closed their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, convents, temples and churchyards.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayer gatherings in areas affected by the pandemic and closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia closed the entrance to foreign pilgrims and also closed the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic, since World War II, has created a significant disruption in the world's sporting calendar.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, Sessions, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not held after the summer of 2021".
This has led to many gamblers moving online, and new sign-ups for many online gambling sites have increased considerably. The entertainment industry has also been hit hard, with many music groups having to postpone or cancel their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have found ways to work on the Internet and share it with others as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming events, or to create web-based "fairs" so that artists can perform, spread, and promote their work.
Online, many memes based on the coronavirus idea have surfaced as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a lot of prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese and East Asians, in Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has been most severe.
There have been instances of fear, doubt and opposition, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to February reports (while most cases were confined to China), the virus deserves to be vindicated by the racist sentiments expressed against Chinese people in various groups around the world.
Some African countries have also seen anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei reported experiencing discrimination on a regional basis.
Support has been provided for Chinese people, both online and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak and spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to have a COVID-19 outbreak, may be suspicious and fearful of strangers.In an effort to curb the disease, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian residents in the UK and the US, have reported incidents of racist abuse and discrimination.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "the Chinese virus", with critics calling the term racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying evacuees Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from northern India, which shares a border with China, and students studying in India's major cities have been subjected to the stigma of being bullied about the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God has taken revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it "misleading". Since the pandemic in China, xenophobia has been fueled by racist sentiments towards non-Chinese residents, calling foreigners "foreign trash" to be "knocked out".
Many of the papers that have been published have removed some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers about the outbreak available to everyone.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to a pre-publication server, such as bioRixiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that detect the presence of the virus and those that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of the virus as samples, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and designed to detect only RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can also be used for detection diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those with so few symptoms that they were too mild to report or those who had no symptoms at all.
The results of these tests can be used to determine the precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity in a population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a wide variation in how much testing is done between countries.
This variation has led to widely varying reports of mortality rates, which in some countries are likely to be higher than estimates.
Tests on breath samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The PT-PCR test from throat is only reliable in the first week of illness.
Later, when it starts to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For infected individuals tested in the second week, the sample material can alternatively be suctioned from the deep airways via a catheter or coughed up material (coughing).
The first PCR tests were developed using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the Charité site in Berlin in January 2020, which formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test by 23 January 2020. On 28 January 2020, a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) was developed by the South Korean company kogenebiotech.
It looks for the "E" gene that is transmitted by the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was among the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the International Regent Resource.
One in three tests in the older version of the test kit failed due to poor chemistry, and testing bottlenecks at the CDC in Atlanta resulted in less than 100 samples a day throughout February 2020.
As of 28 February 2020, tests using two components were not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also gave availability of COVID-19 testing nationwide as of 9 March 2020.
Quantitative limits were not announced; collection of samples and further processing should be strictly in line with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Service.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours, meaning that a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories on Abott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly obtained EUA from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the procedure yields positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott expects to scale up the number of machines to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically limited to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid test for influenza.
The final words of the review of written material in March 2020 are "The initial stage of chest radiography diagnosis is of no significance, however the presence of [CT computed tomography] before the onset of symptoms is possible".
Common features of CT include two-sided multi-lobed ground glass opacity with a disproportionate and posterior distribution of the circumference.
As the disease progresses, there is a development of total dominance, of crazy smoothness and stability.
In Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, a study comparing PCR and CT suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, and has many features similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first-line diagnosis for COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
The partial immune response to infection including IgM and IgG is the production of antibodies.
They can be used to detect infection in people who have had symptoms for 7 days, to assess immunity, and for people who are under close surveillance.
Automated systems developed for high-throughput testing in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will be limited to the rate of output for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for CLT, although many samples can be used to detect immunocompetence.
PoCT is usually performed by drawing a blood sample through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notification to the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It is capable of testing hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is faster than traditional PCR for detecting RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the test kits purchased were valid.
Hong Kong introduced a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "Emergency Department will give the patient a sample tube", spit in it, send it back and get the result shortly after. The UK's NHS announced that it is launching a scheme to test suspected cases at home on an experimental basis, eliminating the risk of the patient transmitting infection to other people or if they come to the hospital. Ambulances are used once to clear the infection.
South Korea has performed more tests faster and more efficiently than any other country thanks to drive-through centers.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day in normal seating and last week performed 10,700 tests.
When the physician says the test is costly, the health insurance covers the cost.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
Drive-in tests were offered in several major cities by March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested by calendar week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for 2-SARS-CoV this week.Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and adopted a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, where all samples are collected and further tests are only done if the samples turn out positive.A 2,000 square meter emergency detection laboratory called "YanHuo-H" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was set up in Wuhan, launched by the BGI on 5 February 2020.
I'm not going to die.
The Wuhan lab's method was immediately adopted by the Ho-Yun labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, bringing the total to 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open-source multi-component designs that can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients with just 93 attempts. These parallel designs can be put to use in small laboratories without a robotic fluid handler.
By March, a shortage and insufficient amount of the reagent has become a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the UK and US.
This has led some authors to investigate the protocol for preparing samples that heat samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome or chromosome for further testing.The UAE is now testing more of its population for coronavirus than any other country, according to a March 31 announcement, and is pursuing a plan to reach its entire population.
The ISAU benefited from both the drive-through capability and the laboratory developed for the large population by Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their "HUO-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The lab, which was set up in 14 days, performed 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German recipe for low-income countries, which don't have the resources to make the kit.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020, the protocols developed in the US to control the disease were not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US in the early days of the outbreak due to concerns about the quality of the test kit in China and the US, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide the kits despite recommendations and demands from health experts.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's large supply of testing has reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has promoted testing capacity in private sector laboratories over the past few years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing programs to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high spread of the virus has led to an increase in testing demand, with tens of millions of tests being stalled in US private laboratories, and pressure on the supply of bleach and chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The kits made by the CDC in the US had "flaws", the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.Spain purchased the kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the incorrect results was the error in collecting the sample or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said that the kits that gave incorrect results would be removed and replaced with a test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the ones purchased by the Czech state from China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased from China by Slovakia did not turn out to be correct.
Prime Minister Matuk suggested that they be dumped in the Danube River.Atkara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the kits Turkey bought from China had "a very high error rate" and were "not put into use".The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but declared them unusable in early April 2020.
The testing resulted in good results in the detection of quarantined individuals and those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients in case of a positive result.
In the town of Vo, Italy, where the first COVID-19 death occurred, researchers working with the entire population, which was about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Almost half of the people tested were asymptomatic, and all detected cases were quarantined.
Restricting travel to certain groups of people has led to a complete decline in new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic, due to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, had a much smaller impact on Singapore than developed countries around the world, which did not have strict restrictions such as forcible closures of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay indoors from 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday ended on 23 March.
Many other countries also managed to contain the pandemic through strict measures such as contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not through more stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One statistical study found that countries that tested more, in terms of mortality, had lower mortality rates, perhaps because they were able to detect people with fewer or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries that do not have testing capabilities and national laboratories to handle COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below refers to a country's testing policy.
A country that tests only those who are admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all of its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, equally.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning one's hands of dirt, grime, germs, or other unnecessary materials.
Washing hands with soap and water several times a day on some "necessary occasions" prevents many diseases from spreading, for example, the entry of diarrheal and diarrheal germs into the mouth.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential times of the day when hand washing with soap is most important: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, ash can be used to clean hands. The World Health Organization gives the following hand-washing recommendations:
before, during and after preparing a meal.
Before and after treatment of the sick individual.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
After a strong blow to the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the compliance of medical procedures with the principles of hygiene.
Hand washing or medical care before taking medication can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing in a clinical setting is to clear the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or spread disease.
This is especially true for those in the food or medical field, but it's also a good habit for the general public.
Handwashing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrheal illness; reducing respiratory infections;
And the mortality rate of home births decreases.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand-washing habits slightly improved height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce child deaths from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce deaths from these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the death rate from diarrhea by a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce the mortality rate from diarrhea by 48%. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive means of preventing diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI). It is an automated practice that can be practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a leading ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, claiming the lives of some 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands before and after meals to a more natural way could save more lives than using a vaccine or medical intervention, i.e. halving deaths from diarrhea and reducing deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is generally part of other hygiene and sanitation activities, such as water, sewage and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also helps protect against diseases that are transmitted directly through the feces.
A minor disadvantage of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying it out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy skin called chlamydia, which is commonly found in people in the medical field.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times in a day when hand washing with soap is critical to reduce the spread of disease through the feces and mouth: after using the bathroom (urinating or defecating), after cleaning the baby's bottom (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before and after eating and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other occasions when hands should be washed properly to prevent transmission of disease include: before and after handling a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or cleaning the nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling fecal matter.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is less common.
In 2015, a study on hand washing in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, Saudi Arabia had the highest rate, 97%, the US was in the middle, 77%, and China had the lowest rate, 23%. Many behaviors change the current practice to increase the rate of hand washing with soap at critical times.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the massive promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes twice-a-year insect spraying, daily hand washing with soap, and daily fluoride toothbrushing.
It has been successfully tested in Indonesia.
The skin disinfection process has been improved by mixing soap and detergents with water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility barrier and increase solubility.
Water alone is insufficient for skin cleansing because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soils, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning, however, is by means of proper water flow.
In solid soap, due to reuse, bacteria can be present due to previous use.
Some studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soaps say that this transfer cannot occur because the bacteria are eliminated with the foam.
The CDC still says that "liquid soap without hand control is a preferred option".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted in the health-conscious public.
There is no evidence that the use of prescribed antibiotics produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps don't pick up antibiotic resistance, they're not as effective as they're said to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin-protective agents, more refined formulations can have benzoic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, disinfectant, and skin conditioner (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). Simple soaps are just as effective for consumers as antibacterial soaps containing triclosan that protect against diseases and remove bacteria from the hands, according to a detailed analysis by the University of Oregon, School of Public Health.
The warm water that is comfortable for the hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37°C).
However, semi-hot, soapy water is more effective at removing natural oil, which absorbs dirt and bacteria, than cool, soapy water.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies say that semi-warm water is not effective for hand disinfection.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century alcohol-based hand sanitizers without water (also called alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed into a thick agent, such as carbomer (a polysomellic mixture of poly acrylic acids) in a jelly-like substance or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid substance or foamed to ease of use and reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of oxide to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol sanitizers containing 70% alcohol (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of use and kill 99.99% to 99.999%, (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria after 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are very effective for bacteria and less effective for a few other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for norovirus, the most common cause of infectious disease of the small intestine.
Massage the front and back of both hands and the middle and back of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
Finger pads should also be washed thoroughly and rubbed on the palms of both hands. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with a sanitizer, especially when the hands are visibly contaminated.
The rapid use of such materials is due to their ease of use and ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered as a substitute for formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are unavailable.
Excessive use of alcohol-based skin-tissue moisturizers can result in dry skin, unless creams and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
Glycerine and/or other creams may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical trials have shown that using alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing cream causes less burning and dryness than using soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic reactions can sometimes occur in the case of various diseases or hypersensitivity to alcohol or due to the inclusion of narcotic substances in alcohol.
It's been shown to be less prone to inflammatory skin diseases than handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, they don't clean up water-free organic matter, they just disinfect it.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in treating the spread of many germs, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and the formulation, and historically they have not been very effective.
Recently, the recipes that use benzalkonium chloride have shown overall antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, and have decreased in efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to a skin reaction.
In many low-income communities, people cannot afford to buy soap and instead use ash or clay.
Ash and dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated with germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it combines with water to form an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or clay if soap is not available.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following to prevent the spread of disease:
Wet hands with running, semi-hot or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, whereas water temperature doesn't matter.
Rub hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle of the fingers, and the base of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of water.
Meet for at least 20 seconds.
Friction is produced by friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and longer friction removes more germs.
Clean thoroughly with plenty of water.
Washing in a basin can re-contaminate hands.
Wipe with a dry towel or air dry.
Wet and damp hands can easily become re-contaminated. Commonly omitted areas include the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers, and the edges of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-translucent nail polish can be susceptible to germs.
Moisturizing lotions are commonly prescribed to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, very low-cost facilities can be provided, such as a hanging can or a locker-like vegetable with suitable holes, water in the inlet and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps" or other low-cost methods are available.
The tippy-tap is a simple technique that involves a jug suspended from a rope and a foot-operated lever that pours a little water onto the hands and a soap dispenser.
Effective hand drying is part of hand hygiene practice, but there is debate about what is the most effective method of drying in public restrooms.
Most studies suggest that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often found in latrines.
In 2008 a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium. It included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and the modern jet-air hand dryers in terms of presenting hygiene standards.
After washing hands and drying them with a hot air dryer, the rate of bacteria on finger pads increased on average by 194% and on palms by 254%.
Drying with a jet-air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in bacterial rates on finger pads and 15% on palms.
After washing and drying hands with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on finger pads was reduced by an average of 76% and on palms by 77%. The scientists also tested to prove whether each type of drying procedure has the potential to spread contamination to other washroom users and the washroom environment.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from hands and the unit and can contaminate other users of the sanitary unit and the environment of the sanitary unit up to 2 meters away.
A hot air hand dryer can spread germs up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
No specific germs are transmitted through tissue. Different hand drying methods were evaluated in a 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt.
The following changes in bacterial counts occurred after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and the dryers have been compared to paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water, hand washing with sanitized paper is an alternative during travel.
Alcohol-based sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medically, hand washing was made mandatory by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1846) after discovering its efficacy in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically, hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using a certain amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hand.
Fingers should be rubbed together.
If there is dirt on the fingernails, a hard brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them well with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and to open the return door if necessary).
This will prevent the hands from becoming contaminated again after being applied to these surfaces.
Hand washing in a healthcare setting is intended to remove and prevent the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms ("germs").
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that even in the medical setting, handwashing is unacceptably low, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before routinely touching patients, thus becoming a source of germ transmission.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple practices reduce the rate of urinary tract infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper that shows the correct way to wash hands and touch in the health sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidance from the institution can be viewed for public comment on their website.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial hand tools can test and verify hand hygiene, if this is mandated.
The World Health Organization has identified "five reasons" for hand washing:
When exposed to blood/body moisture
Before the disinfection, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of a chemical disinfectant to the soap (a "medicated or "antimicrobial" soap) gives the disinfectant the task of washing the hands.
Disinfecting is required before surgery or where antibiotic resistant organisms are high. To "scrub" your hands for surgery, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, washing with chlorhexidine or iodine, a disinfected towel to dry your hands after washing, a disinfected brush to rub, and a second disinfected tool to clean your fingernails.
All the jewelry should be removed.
This involves washing hands from wrist to elbow, usually for 6 to 2 minutes.
Long rubbing (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When pouring water on the middle of the arm, make sure it does not return to the hands.
After the hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after seeing a patient or to apply a hand sanitizer.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has shown that the greatest benefit of hand hygiene was obtained with the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased from 35% there was little additional benefit.
In a study of the bacterial infection transmission in the United States, the use of plain soap was three times more effective than antibacterial soap. Comparing the 30-second hand-rubbing of alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soap each, it was found that the alcohol-based hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions for removing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands. In health-related settings, improving hand hygiene will require staff training on handwashing, availability of alcohol-based hand solutions, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which interventions are most effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered a low-cost, good-health, even good-nutrition option.
However, the lack of a constant supply of water, soap and hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a major challenge in making universal hand washing a habit for all.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa it is very rare to have a hand washing tap near a private or public toilet, although very low cost hand washing facilities are possible.
However, the decreased rate of hand washing may be due to the maturation of the habit rather than lack of soap and water.
The promotion and promotion of handwashing with soap can influence decision-making, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and create far-reaching changes in population behaviour.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that in LMICs, working in a particular community is more effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One way to promote hand washing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap in addition to other hygiene principles.
When they reach the minimum standard, schools can reach second and then third stars.
The creation of hand washing facilities can be part of a public hand washing campaign, aimed at reducing illness and mortality in children.
World Handwashing Day is the second example of this awareness campaign, which aims to change behavior.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have found that overall hand washing is less costly in developing countries, ignoring DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap is more cost-effective than water and waste management.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospital - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two of the first hand hygiene physicians: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by bad smells.
In the 1980s, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further promoted hand hygiene as the main means of preventing the spread of infection due to food-borne diseases and public health-related infections.
The 2009 swine flu and the 2020 global pandemic of COVID-19 increased awareness in many countries that handwashing with soap is critical to preventing such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung outside public restrooms, in the toilets of office buildings and at airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands of" means that a person declares not to take responsibility for something or to say something.
The saying is from the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate expressed his disapproval of Jesus' crucifixion, but it later became common in English-speaking society as a proverb.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to keep washing her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which reveals the anguish of her conscience over the guilt of murdering her husband.
It's also been found that people who remember or reflect on immoral behavior wash their hands more often than others, and they place a high value on hand-washing utensils.
Furthermore, people who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using non-soapy water to wash hands, is a feature of many religions: e.g. Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Twelve in Judaism, Nityalit Yajayam, Lawa in Christianity, and Wadi Islam. Religions recommend hand washing for hygiene, especially after certain activities.
In Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam, it is mandatory to wash one's hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Workplace risk control for COVID-19 refers to the implementation of occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of risks in workplaces depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and among workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure hazard jobs are those with minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette, and keeping the work environment clean and disinfected.
Moderate exposure risk is for jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to have been exposed to COVID-19, but may be affected by social migration and international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, densely populated work environments and a large number of retail locations.
In addition to basic infection prevention precautions for this node, risk control includes high-performance air filters for air circulation, protection from sneezing, and personal protective equipment if a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers the exposure of health care and mortuary workers to a person with or suspected of COVID-19 to be a high risk, with a very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or handle samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
These workers will need to take appropriate risk control measures, such as air-conditioned negative pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of a COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
The methods of trade may vary, both in terms of the demand for goods and in terms of the supply of those goods (such as purchases at low-altitude times, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, geographically disrupted shipments from COVID-19-stricken areas may be disrupted.
The project identifies the risk levels associated with different workplaces and occupations, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the containment practices and contingency plans for outbreak situations that are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparedness and response plans for an infectious disease may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
Reducing transfers between staff for the purposes of responding to an outbreak, protecting those at risk from adverse health complications, and reducing adverse impacts on business operations and supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the community where the business is located.
The hazard management classification framework is widely used in occupational safety and health to effectively manage group hazards.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are those implemented by the controls, followed by the administrative controls, and finally the personal protective equipment.
The controls that are put in place are designed to isolate employees from work-related hazards, regardless of their behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control refers to changes in work policy and procedures that require action from the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management controls, but can help prevent some emergencies.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to workers, installed properly, if applicable (e.g., a solvent extraction device), worn consistently and accurately, maintained and replaced regularly, and, if necessary, removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces to prevent infection include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette including covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue and litter, arranging for telephone conversations or rotating attendance if necessary, encouraging workers to avoid using other people's tools and equipment, and routine cleaning and disinfecting of the workplace.
Identifying and isolating potentially infectious individuals is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home until the fever, symptoms of fever, or other symptoms have resolved without at least 24 hours of use of fever or other symptom-reducing medication, that sick leave policies be flexible, that allow employees to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at moderate risk of disclosure are those that require close or continuous contact over a distance of six feet (1.8 m) from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission around the business, or because the individual has a recent international trip where there has been mass transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, in crowded work environments and in high-density retail locations. This includes installing high-performance air filters, increasing airflow rates, installing material barriers such as plastic guards to prevent spills, and drive-through windows to serve customers to establish controls for high-risk groups. For this and other high-risk groups, administrative control means encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with manual communication, whether it is necessary to travel to and from places where the COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing, and canceling meetings, interactions or restrictions for the workplace, providing workers with appropriate safety equipment to respond to sexual health issues, including personal protective equipment, hand-washing, hand-washing, and other personal protective measures, providing training and training to workers who need to use personal protective equipment, and reducing the risk to the public, including hand-washing, hand-washing, and other workplace safety measures, and providing immediate access to personal protective equipment, including training and hands-washing, to workers who are at risk of developing COVID-19.
The use of respirators is rare among workers in this high-risk group.
If someone gets sick on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, assigning a crew member to the sick person, and offering the sick person a face mask or telling the patient to cover their mouth and hands with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in purpose-made bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk management includes postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and informing the on-board medical centre immediately if fever or any other symptoms appear.
The CDC recommends that if an infected person has been in a school building, even if they have not spread the virus, they should be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is mild to moderate transmission of the virus, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or cancelling meals at cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, limiting arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visits, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant amount of transmission in the local community, long-term school closures may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during confinement, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using a household cleaning spray or wipe before reuse, and follow the standard import procedure for disposing of used PPE and its contents and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some healthcare facilities and morgue workers are at high or very high exposure risk.
Health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers in high exposure risk jobs who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are at high risk of exposure when workers perform aerosol manufacturing operations, or collect or handle samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the process of making aerosols, the insertion of a drain, coughing procedures, examination of the throat ducts, some dental procedures and examinations, or collection of unpleasant samples.
Jobs at higher exposure risk in mortuaries include workers who prepare the dead bodies of people who had known or suspected COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional controls, including the segregation of rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and the use of aerosol procedures.
Special negative pressure air transport devices may be appropriate in some health centers and morgues.
The samples should be handled under biosafety level 3 security measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be quarantined in specific waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work 6 feet away from a known patient or suspected SARS-CoV-2 case, and those who perform aerosol-forming procedures.
In the United States, a comprehensive and written respiratory safety program should be used to breathe with an NIOSH-approved N95 filtration device or better, including appropriate testing, training, and clinical evaluation.
Other types of respirators may provide better protection and enhance worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend full coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not a disease transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for staff at the entry screens.
For people who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, or face shields, gowns and gloves.
If the aerosol-making procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Recognizing that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, allowing only those who are directly caring for a COVID-19 patient to enter the room, the use of PPE is necessary for a specific task, using the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and managing the supply chain of PPE, and discouraging the use of masks by those without symptoms.

We are experiencing extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one that has made it clear that humans are universally connected and have responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for this kind of challenge, but we know very well that our best response is global empathy, cooperation, and community building that is the spirit of this institution.
The feelings of friendship and affection that we've seen in all of our colleagues in emails, phone calls, and chat, all of which are validations of how lucky we are to work with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud that you're all my co-workers.
Last week, someone complimented me on our work.
It reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how powerful a sign it is for this critical resource that they have available online to everyone.
Your work has made this possible, whether you're with the sites or our colleagues who are contributing or our community is being kept safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some major changes this coming week in how we work together.
We were able to attend the meetings in the Kingdom Hall.
As Robyn has stated before, the c-team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we discussed what the best response to what we are facing is and how to keep the organization on its feet in the meantime.
We were desperate to end the long-term tensions and advance our mission.
If you want to dial, fine.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, whichever comes first.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you can work normal hours, the mission can put you to use.
However, there's nothing to say about the world right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, shop for groceries, or visit the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
It doesn't have to be said, but we're saying it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help rebuild your team's calendar and schedule to ensure all aspects of the work are completed.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, so T&C can help with support and ensure that your situation is properly managed.)
Friends who work by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said this before, and we're going to say it again to our contractors and our hourly staff as we meet our responsibilities.
Each person will be paid for the hours they worked during normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people work to change their stress in the world around them.
What we can do is incredibly useful, especially on days like this.
Again, this is all for your personal safety.
We just want you to talk to your manager, so we can figure out what to expect from you and then we can make decisions accordingly.
A task is considered a must.
There are some things we should continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) do the hard work, which may require additional support.
We're going to have to shift our focus to all departments looking at the current objectives and supporting what's important to our mission.
We all have so much to do, we'll all just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
We're not planning to "get it right" once the pandemic is over.
You're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines, which is unrealistic at this point.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the AP?
To set up our new reality and expectations for daily working hours, we intend to set up our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan to create a budget that takes longer to create, where workers are allowed to change their work priorities, and their loved ones' needs are able to be met in a way that accommodates those in need who want to work fewer hours.
This time extension will greatly reduce the workload and stress of existing planning across the organization.
We will present our plan to the board next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you for leading the AP team in this.
Office location, appearance and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our friends in SF may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, despite the extreme caution, we have already deployed an anti-virus process in our San Francisco office to clean all the surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant solution to clean every level of the balcony and the arms of the stairs that access our faces.
This building is using its own security protocols to protect its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully prepared as soon as we decide to return.
Our office is located in DCVWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC office staff members and us.
For the past week, our DC office has moved to a remote location that complies with the San Francisco Common Core guidelines.
As some of our NYC residents know, we're also leasing a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
Our old-timers know that this could be an adjustment and would like to give you some advice.
The length of the meetings can be extended to a maximum of one or two hours.
If long seats are required, consider how to distribute them on different days.
Make each meeting clear as to the agenda, and send the reading material first.
Default video, with features like Google Docs and Zoom for live collaboration and communication
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, someone should monitor the discussion for questions and track the list of speakers and someone should help take notes (or collaborate on note-taking).
If you need a more comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your welfare allowance for snacks.
Join the #RemoteSuccess channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the distributed work across the foundation.
Last week we asked all social benefits recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as EdHatons, until the World Health Organization declares the end of the pandemic.
They should know that we consider that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it possible for them to complete their agreed cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or delaying these objectives.
In the coming weeks we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feeling of the global community is saddened by the disruption but satisfied by the clear ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to provide the community with the opportunity to track their communications and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related cases.
We will send you an invitation to a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll use this time to share updates, answer your questions, and spend some time keeping in touch with each other.
There are seven of us in this, and we'll help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT This page will keep updates and all other information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contact with staff members currently residing in countries that are highly affected.
If you have a travel, event, an important task, or coverage challenge or anything else that you need help with, please feel free to work with CRT and get up to date.
We are here to provide timely support and connections.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a way of abandoning our work and responsibilities.
But they are a recognition at this point, that our work and our responsibilities will need to be shaped in a way that we've never seen before.
These are actions that we feel are important to help each other to do so that we can continue to work, to give our movement the support it needs and the service to the world that they depend on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be there waiting for us.
After that, helping each other requires time and time for the important work that will come in the next few weeks, possibly in the next few months.
To do that, we need all of you, and that's why it's important that you take care of yourself and your family so that you're in the best possible shape when the call comes.
Now, please, wave your hands and don't wash your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jim V, Jenni Y, Lisa S, Rubin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 competes with the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the amount of angiotensin (1-7) making it a reliable drug for treating heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc-containing metaloenzyme found on the surface of the endothelium and in the rest of the cell.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal collagen renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I inhibitor protein, with its active domain present on the cell surface in the lung and other fibers.
The ACE2 domain outside cells is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadesis, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream, which is eventually excreted via the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily associated with type II lung leukocytes, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the outer cortex of the brain, the body planctum, from the little finger down to the elbow, in the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an anti-balancer of ACE.
ACE catalyzes the release of the hormone angiotensin I into the bloodstream of angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn separates the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), also known as (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides including [des-org 9]-bradecyanin, apalin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the transport of the natural amino acid-carrying membrane SLC6A19 and is implicated in cerebral pathology.
As a protein translocator, ACE2 serves as the main entrance into the cells of several coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the restriction of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular surface to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 leads to ingestion of the intracellular material of a cell membrane and intracellular migration of both virus and enzyme.
This process of interference also requires the primacy of the S-protein by the representative serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition continues as a potential treatment under current investigation. This has led some to conclude that with reduced levels of ACE2 in cells, it may be easier to cope with the disease.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have advised against continuing general ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and cardiac arrest, was also reduced.
ACEs were also associated with a decrease in mortality from preventive pneumonia, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is being promoted as a novel treatment for severe liver injury, and it has been shown to improve hemodynamics and oxygen delivery to patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the action starts in 30 minutes plus 24 hours of effect (duration).
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better drug for people with intolerance to the classical RAS inhibitor, or in diseases where angiotensin II circulation is excessive - elevated rhACE2 absorption has been diagnosed during clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress.
The B'COVID-19 app is a mobile application that helps to communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example by identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an infected person.
Several such applications have been created or proposed in several regions and constituencies with the support of the government.
Several application frameworks have been developed to find the connection.
Privacy concerns were raised, particularly about the system used to locate the geolocation of the app's user.
A less intrusive alternative involves using Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple jointly announced on April 10, 2020, that they would collaborate to integrate these types of Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out if they have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
They're used in over 200 cities in China.
The app was created by a local IT community, released as open source and will be shared with the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can track the proximity of potentially infected people and provide immediate response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Information Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on 12 April that the contact tracing app is in the next stage of development and will be available for launch within a week - with similar apps ("Stop COVID") planned in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the Bluetris protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients based in Moscow, to ensure that people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has identified several potential practical problems in app-based systems, including false positives and low probability of effectiveness, if the application is used by only a small segment of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of a malicious or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only "government" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the numerous restrictions on surveillance on the coronavirus app, especially whether the surveillance arrangements created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance arrangements.
These agencies have announced eight conditions on government projects:
Surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
The surveillance and extension of surveillance should be for a certain period of time:
The use of data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity will be protected and evidence-based security will be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance must avoid being overly discriminatory and trivial;
Sharing data with a third party must be defined by law;
Precautions against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The targeted participation of all "relevant partners" would be required, including public health experts and non-mainstream interest groups.The Computer Club of Germany (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also released watchlists.
The Google/Apple proposal aims to solve the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the monitoring mechanism from the device of its operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based spot-tracking systems instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to evade surveillance.
A network-based surveillance system was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which sometimes access the raw data of the palace, have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems have been built that only use central servers to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a single best-of-breed application, the system collects surveillance information from various sources, including surveillance data on a mobile device and data exchange from a card, and aggregates them to produce text-message notifications for potentially affected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the information publicly available to inform potential contacts, something that was allowed due to far-reaching changes in data privacy laws at the time the MERS outbreak broke out in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have also considered both centralized and privacy protection systems.
Details were not released until 6 April 2020.
Privacy-protected connection monitoring is a better concept, with a considerable history of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to allow the user to access the premises from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes: decentralized privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), connection temporary number (TCN,fka event contact number, CEN), sensitive privacy protocol and procedure for keeping mobile contacts connected (PACT), and others.
The identifiable personal data in these protocols is not transferred from the device and is transferred to all matching devices.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing Safe Routes, a platform for using privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or routing intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This white paper is based on research by "Apps Gone Wrong: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTress platform by EngaMPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
The Global TCN Alliance was founded on April 5, 2020 by several groups who came together with the goal of sharing a common vision and who were largely overriding protocols, to reduce the dispersal gap so that surveillance and response apps could be globally enabled as a mutual capability, which is a key aspect of achieving mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had open-sourced its government-owned application, the Bluetris app.
On April 10, 2020, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, Google and Apple, announced a communication tracking initiative, which they claimed will protect privacy, based on a combination of vulnerable Bluetooth energy technology and protection privacy encryption.
They also published specifications of the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Implementing the protocol will enable governments to issue official security privacy applications for coronavirus detection.
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple intend to address the issues of constant surveillance by first distributing the system via operating system updates, and then removing it in the same manner when the threat is eliminated.
Drug switching (also called drug re-targeting, re-profiling, task switching, or treatment switching) is the changing or using of a drug approved for the treatment of one disease to treat another disease instead of the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to find effective and safe treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of robustic plasma.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 pharmacological proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these immunization sites provides a suitable plan to develop an antiviral drug effective against COVID-19 proteins.
The most prominent target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papin-like, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphate proteins.
A. Hussain, et al. studied several candidate compounds that were then modified and analyzed with the highest approved drugs for their structural similarity to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 antagonist in a pre-clinical study, to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used for some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its co-developer hydrochlorquine would be among four drugs to be studied in cohort clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, FDR approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials procedures and is only allowed for emergency use under its EUA for patients who are hospitalized but not treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease has not yet been determined".
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option left".
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is conducting a short study on the use of chlorokine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the precautionary use of hydrochlorothiazide.
Chinese trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly" effective.
In Shenzhen, an average of 35 patients tested negative in 4 days, compared to the 45 patients who did not take the drug, whose disease lasted 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the drug through the military in university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shenzhou Abe has overwhelmed the Trump administration about purchasing the drug - which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already been ramped up.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/retnavir (Clethira), a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and retnavir, concluded that it "did not show any benefit".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.The scientific community is criticizing the shift in resources to reformulating drugs, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/retnavir in the international synchronization trial.
Remedicivir was developed and promoted by Gilead Science for the prevention of Ebola virus disease and the treatment of Marburg virus diseases. Immediately after its release, Gilead Science discovered that Remedicivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phyllo, phumo, paramexo and corona-viruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the promotion of resistance by mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that there may be a high genetic barrier of resistance to remdesivir. Several such clinical trials, including two run by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with mild disease and the other for people with severe disease, are included.
There are three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C injections for patients with severe COVID-19 who are hospitalized; two are controlled (China, Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
New York state began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial for Taigen's elvesco (Sylsonide), a steroid-like hormone for respiratory patients with asthma, to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus who have not shown symptoms of the disease.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin II, a form of angiotensin converting enzyme, is planned to select 200 critical patients admitted to hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, selected 6,000 adults over the age of 40 who had COVID-19 and who had mild symptoms but did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have effective contraception, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulant blood drugs are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight liver and bile acids are being used to treat patients on a large scale, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on their use.
On 14 April, a multicentre study on 300 patients investigating the use of inoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and treatment was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, all scientific attention has been focused on recreating approved antiviral drugs, such as those developed in the outbreak of previously emerging MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition guidelines of China.
Mifevir: Ribevavir was prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Some antibiotics potentially reusable for treatment of COVID-19:
Toxazomib (anti-tocal-6 receptor): Approved by the Chinese
And also in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab #COVID-19
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a dummy vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 to be available, with a vaccine for the causative virus expected to be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major pandemic broke out in 2020, triggering significant investment and research activity in the development of a vaccine.
Several entities are using advertised loopy substances to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was stated that CEP's critical steps to develop a vaccine are accelerated, with manufacturers' capacity, deployment scale and global reach at risk.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Several major platform targets in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developers and vaccine candidates: ConSinobiology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been announced but little public information is available about them (these are thought to be in the planning stages or are already being designed).
Phase I-II trials are preliminary safety and immunity testing, usually randomised, controlled with drug-free samples, and at multiple sites, while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically include more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects at higher doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet testable in humans (yet in "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to enhance an immune response.
In Canada, on or about January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it will begin work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.

on the promotion and development of a vaccine.
These partners further announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a Phase I trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolated individuals and at a pace that would require at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
A biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported on 12 March 2020 the preparation of a coronavirus-like particle with partial support from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered Kevork a 'large sum' for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested against.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin by April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, an Italian company, Taxis Biotech, announced that it would conduct pre-clinical trials by April 2020 and start human trials of its final vaccine candidate by autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Pandemic Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium comprising the Institut Pasteur, Thames Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, CoreWalk, Invove, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of several vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-developed RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 response medical issues, including several vaccine candidates in initiatives by Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with several new vaccines planned to form a national "vaccine bank" that would be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020 researchers from the University of Petersberg School of Medicine reported experiments on petococcal, a possible COVID-19 virus in mice, stating that "MNA demonstrated strong antigen-related antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine [in mice] that was clearly manifested 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate harmless virus-like particles within human bacteria, which boost the immune system's antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits in addition to the disease they want to avoid.
In Australia, 4,170 healthcare workers are being enrolled for another randomized trial.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective in the development phase.
Initial research to test the efficacy of vaccines using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-resistant mice, other laboratory animals and non-human higher creatures, biosafety level 3 interventions to directly address the virus, and the need for international coordination to ensure standardised protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been discovered that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions worldwide. There is no proven vaccine for the treatment of MERS.
When MERS first appeared, it was believed that the existing SARS research would be a useful model in the development of a treatment and vaccine against MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others had been released, all vectored viral vaccines, two adrenoviral vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is already known and its vaccine is already available.
Patents appearing in various social media posts have been linked to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines and other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, chills, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sleep, and abdominal pain.
The time from onset to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may last from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are mild, some go as far as viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered -- the virus is mainly spread by close contact in public, often in the form of small droplets from the mouth when smoking, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are released when you exhale, they often fall on the ground or floor, instead of being transmitted over long distances.
People can also get it by rubbing their hands on an infected surface, or by rubbing their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread it before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the temporal reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on human saliva in infections.
The use of masks is advised for those who are suspected of being infected and for other healthcare professionals.
There is a difference in the recommendation of wearing a mask for the general public, with some officials opposing its use, some recommending its use, and some calling it mandatory.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may develop cold-like symptoms such as fever, chills, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, recurrent chest pain or pressure, mental confusion, difficulty waking, and facial or lip blue; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Symptoms of upper respiratory illness such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may also be present.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in varying percentages.
In China, there were initially few cases of chest tightness and chest pains.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to seven days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
The status of these asymptomatic individuals is not yet fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may be carriers of the disease.
The proportion of people with the disease who were asymptomatic is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during hospital stays.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases from 1 April; 130 (78%) of 166 infected patients were asymptomatic at the time of testing that day.
Both the virus and the spore can have an excess viral load.
Loud speech produces more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that untreated Kakansi drops have the ability to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresol transmission may be possible and viral RNA samples have been found to be positive in air collectors in the halls outside the rooms of individuals.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolise respiratory fluids and consequently may spread into the air.
While there are concerns that it may be spread through waste, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; and if it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be viable for one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies with humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are effective if used correctly; soap products inactivate the virus's greasy protective layer, as well as they clear the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzoic chloride and chlorhydrazine gluconate (a surgical antiseptic), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 is a severe novel respiratory illness coronavirus, first detected in three people in Wuhan with pneumonia with severe respiratory illness.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which rupture its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most commonly affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses these host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II membrane cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special layer of sugar called a "pel" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of those hospitalized with the disease had severe heart damage and severe illness is common.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to immune system diseases during whole-body inflammation and disease progression, but severe cardiovascular injury to the heart may also be associated with ACE2 inhibitors.
2ACEs are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Increased incidences of arterial blood clotting (31%) and thrombobolism (25%) were observed in intensive care unit patients infected with COVID-19 and may be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a bias for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract epithelial cells, severe patients infected with COVID-19 have more than normal inflammatory symptoms affecting the body.
In particular, the pathogenic SM-CSF secreting T-cell was associated with the induction of inflammatory IL-6-derived unicellular cell proliferation and severe pulmonary disease in COVID-19 infected patients.
There have also been reports of lymphatic cell interference at the time of autopsy.
The WHO has published several screening procedures for the disease.
The standard method of experiments is the time-reversed transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath moisture samples from the nasal cavity; however, nasal cavity or saliva samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but this requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and results are less immediate in importance.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infectious disease caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development, but are not yet widely used.
The Chinese test showed only 60 to 70 percent accuracy.
The FDA approved the first care test center for use in the United States at the end of the month on 21 March 2020.Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines to detect the outbreak taking into account the clinical features and epidemic risk.
In early infectious disease bilateral polygamy, ground glass opacitis, and peripheral, inappropriate and subsequently fragmented blurring are common.
As the disease progresses, complete dominance, creepy pivings (thickness of the veil with variable facial features like a veil) and stability may appear.
Some statistics are available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The major positive findings on the autopsy are:
Macroscopic: inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the heart membrane, stabilization of the lungs and inflammation of the lungs.
There are four different severities of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, an excess of pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, perforation of the lymphatic cells with inflammation and formation of polyalphagous giant cells.
Severe pneumonia: decreased facial loss (DAD) with decreased facial palsy.
DA fears the appearance of symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and severe oxygen deprivation in the body.
Pneumonia: organization of the expulsion of the ovarian cavities and the pulmonary mucosa into the intestine
Blood: Dissemination of blood clots in the veins (DIC); white and red blood reactions.
Precautions to reduce the chance of illness include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth to cover the mouth in crowds, to limit the spread of the virus from people who are not showing symptoms.Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
No effective treatment has been discovered for COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until before 2021, a key to managing COVID-19 is to reduce the epidemic's peak level of what is called "flattering the cough".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of hand sanitizers based on at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO has established two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is generated by ethanol and isopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help kill bacterial eggs; it is "not an active agent in the hands of the causative agent".
Glycerol is added as a laxative.
People have been managed with supportive care, which includes fluid therapy, oxygenation, and support for other major affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Non-contact membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and improved diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the outbreak.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., cardiologists and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some physicians prescribed paracetamol (methylamino) instead of ibuprofen as the main medication.
Precautions are necessary to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in a medical setting where a medical procedure involving a leak, such as an intravenous line or hand-operated ventilation, is being performed.
For healthcare staff caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs, as well as keeping the person in the airborne infection room (AIIR).
Recommended equipment is: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial use, but the FDA only allows it to be used under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particulates such as dust in the air, but they are not guaranteed to be effective against any specific unapproved biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or homemade masks as a last resort.
People with COVID-19 often do not get so bad that they need mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a small percentage of patients do.
The type of respiratory support in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively being studied, with some evidence that intranasal conduction with high-flow nasal cannula or bilateral positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It's not known whether either of these two treatments have the same benefits for people who are seriously ill.
Dr. Aggarwal prefers mechanical canvases when available as this procedure limits the spread of airborne particulates compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe disease is more common in older adults (some over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Developed countries do not have adequate per capita bed coverage, limiting the capacity of health systems to handle the increase in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
One study found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units in China, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died.
30% of people infected with COVID-19 in China are eventually admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-controlled mode and high PEP-capable ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung damage and chest congestion associated with ventilators.
There will be no more PEEP available on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedive is the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has approved the use of artificially injected human plasma in experimental settings when a person's life is at serious or immediate risk.
It hasn't been clinically tested to show that it's safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to contain the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app uses surveillance data to identify "close contacts" and therefore potential infection risk.
Each user can see the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health officials.It uses mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and big data analytics on artificial intelligence to find infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people who might have coronavirus.
This was done to enforce quarantine and protect those who come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared mobile phone location data collected with the Robert Koch Institute, an agency of the German federal government, to conduct research and stop the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breachers.
The Italian regional health administrator said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still wandering".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonian President Kirsty Kjellin also called for international action to find creative solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse effects of treatment, or fear of the pandemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increased social distancing, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic deprivation are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may develop mildly with few or no symptoms, which resembles other common respiratory illnesses such as the common fever.
The average patient recovers in two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness recover in three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may also be at high risk from COVID-19 based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 infects the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to respiratory failure, decomposition of the body, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include decay, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, particularly prolonged blood clotting, was found in 6% of COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 had elevated levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in the hospital.
However, the median time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median time from onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, compared to a full course of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Post-mortem lung examination showed widespread damage to the presence of air in the lungs with the presence of fibromyzoid debris in small pockets.
Disease-related mutations of the virus-infected cell have been observed in pneumocystis.
The picture of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDC).
According to the National Health Commission of China, 11.8% of deaths were due to elevated troponin levels.
According to the United States Census Bureau, 89% of patients admitted to hospital in March had pre-existing conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomy of the region may also have influenced the mortality rate.
Estimates of mortality vary due to regional variations, but may also be due to difficulties in the methodology.
Low count of common patients may cause excess mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of diseases that were already present means that the current death rates are underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require intensive care or had a 2.4 times higher mortality rate than non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital administration found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This may lead to the emergence of post-recovery intensive care symptoms.
As of March 2020, it was not known to have long-term immunity in people recovering from a previous epidemic.
Other coronaviruses are seen as potentially immune based on their behaviour, but there have also been cases of recovering from COVID-19 and then testing positive for coronavirus again.
These cases are thought to be worsened by long-lasting infections rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and to have originated as an animal-borne disease.
The original source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the epidemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, shows that the earliest onset of symptoms was on 1 December 2019.
The official publications of the WHO reported 8 December 2019 as the first date of the outbreak.
Several measures are commonly used to determine the cause of death.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by factors such as the number of tests performed, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the beginning of the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and assigned clinical or epidemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 epidemics code U07.2.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-incidence ratio as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases, and the infectious fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected cases (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These statistics are not of a specific time and cover a specific population from the disease to the case resolution.
Although not all infected people show antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
A small village of 4,600 inhabitants, Castiglioni d'Adda, in the heart of the epidemic in Italy, has already lost 80 (1.7%) of its population.
In Genghis Khan, the disease spread due to Catholic Christian festivals, and spread to younger people, which has led to a relatively low mortality rate, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been categorized in this way.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The pandemic has a different impact and mortality rate for men and women.
In studies in China and Italy, men had higher mortality rates.
The risk is highest for men after age 50, whereas the difference between men and women ends at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Immunological variations based on sex, less smoking among women and men, and the development of other diseases in men than in women, such as high blood pressure at an early age, may increase the mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men and 72% of the COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the disease's official name was "COVID-19".
WHO President Tetradros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the day when the first case appeared: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal type, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as interim names for viruses and diseases, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against using place names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are chopping medical devices such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the vendor was unable to deliver it in time, a local craftsman made a replica and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misunderstandings about the onset, duration, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Some humans can transmit viruses to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral development in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is underway by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched "combination trials" to evaluate the treatment effects of the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same ACE2 entry route into human cells.
Three vaccine strategies are being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, will provide immediate immunity in humans against the novel COVID-19 disease.
Another strategy, subcomponent vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system against some subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the enzyme pathway of ACE2.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel way to make a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed from these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of a vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020 in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that was cloned from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent amplification was suggested as a potential challenge in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials underway.
Seven trials are testing the drug, which is already an approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research is on re-prescribing the antiviral drug, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir expected to be reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, the development and dynamic review of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for use was already underway.Several existing antiviral drugs are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedicivir, Chloroquinine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retnavir and Lopinavir/Retnavir, which are synthesized with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy from remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are calling for a review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese medical authorities recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that doubling the dose can be extremely dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for physicians to use pyrhydrochloronic and chlorhequin at their discretion in treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that higher levels of rubavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitzaxannide has been suggested for further vivo studies after demonstrating low efficacy in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that early nodal lamina priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting this treatment without further study.Ozaltavir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of OVID-19.
Cytokine stroma can be a complication in severe post-COVID-19 stages.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has the characteristics of anti-cytocytocinstrom. After a brief study, the National Health Commission of China added tocilizumab to the treatment guidelines.
Italy is undergoing a nationally-ranked phase 2 randomized trial after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
The combined serum ferritin blood test, which is used to identify cystic fibrosis, is intended to counteract such progressions, which are thought to be fatal in some infected individuals.
In 2017, the FDA approved the muzanterleukin 6 receptor competitor based on past studies, for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release disease that is predisposed to a different cause, namely CART cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosalizemab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Clarified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 are being investigated as an inactivated immunization of an inactivated vaccine, transferring them to those who need it.
This strategy was tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is a predicted mechanism that could lead to inactivated antibody therapy defending against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody therapy, for example, the use of generated monoclonal antibodies, are being worked on.
The production of a healthy fluid, which is the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be prepared for skin use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
A doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, Li Wenling, became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
