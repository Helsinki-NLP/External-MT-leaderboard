The police in Prague don't know Voldemort or the pastry shop.
The new councillors from the ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague city council and the parliament.
The daily Aktuálně.cz "tried" the members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they know, notoriously introduced slang, which originated in the city hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague political whiz introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out the new councilmen don't understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics", said Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, when asked to test the "Kmotrovsky" dictionary.
And although he was a political veteran, the councillor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you ever put in my mouth that I use occasionally".
"Otherwise I don't recognize slang in general".
From the dictionary, which was published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to a bakery", "bull neck", "betraying the capital" and "fur".
Three of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who will be the head of Prague's education system in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Peter Dolínek, has rejected the test.
"I'm not going to discuss these things and I'm not going to judge how civic democrats are having fun".
"I'm dealing with how we're going to get along in our programs", he responded.
As we have heard, the councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that we are talking about an influential businessman and friend of the ex-president of the city of Bém Roman Janoušk.
Voldemort doesn't say anything to Kauck, and the only term he got right in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanca tunnel", says Kaucky, and immediately adds, "but I know it more from the newspaper".
"I'm gonna have to pay for some language course", he jokes.
The golf hole is then officially deciphered as Blanka tunnel not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by environment councilor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lucas Plach is familiar with where to find this figure - he knows the meaning of the phrase "go to the bakery".
"I mean, go to some Prague business", is the timid close to figuring out that it's the headquarters of Janusz companies.
Like Březina, he recalls that he drew his knowledge from newspapers rather than from such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test takers, there is no similarly familiar vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with my colleagues, but it seems we really don't have anything like this".
"We call each other by our first names, sometimes with abbreviations and abbreviations", says Czech Socialist Party chairman Petr Hulínský, who is nicknamed Hulda by his party.
"I was called Birch at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", admits Karel Březina.
The name of the newspaper Aktuality.cz has been tried and it works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, representative Miroslav Poche, who before the election, he warned about fraud in the sponsorship of the party, has some colleagues nickname "Gamer".
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in their internal speech.
Hulínský says he doesn't like to hear Huldu, but Aktuálně.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague mayor.
The "Doctor of Criminal Law" recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", they've published a pamphlet
Women who are declared witches in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
They are more of an older generation, unable to work for health reasons, for example, and are single and childless.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so she doesn't endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very rare".
"Young, healthy women are not left behind because they help out with work and childbirth", says a nun who cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their community in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual "social measure".
She's published an information pamphlet to help curb the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of Burkina Faso's adults are illiterate", notes the newspaper Die Standard, pointing to the disadvantage of literacy.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African lands.
In neighbouring Ghana, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week after being tortured, sprayed with kerosene and set on fire by three women and two men.
The BBC server reported the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was set on fire by the oil used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have been set on fire after a group tried to "exorcise an evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of their level of education.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul eaters have always been a danger", he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is trying to quell the witch hunt, in The Gambia, the president himself participated in it last year.
"The Gambian president, Jammie, after the death of his aunt, launched a massive witch hunt allegedly to help her death and to try to use black magic to kill the president himself".
"He called in shamans from neighbouring Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal security, forcibly escorted randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai", said Amnesty International in its report.
At the farm, the prisoners were forced to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive the stay at the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Drowning in the furnaces, signed a higher rent
An elderly man walked out of the door of the client center of RPG Apartments "Hlobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a file under his arm with new lease agreements for three apartments: his own, his daughters' and his son's, who is serving time.
All three just got their rent up from deregulation.
Instead of 3500 a month, my son will pay 4100 crowns for 2+1 second category apartment from next year.
"And there is no hot water and petrama must be melted", the man points to his son's new contract, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it", he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civic association, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand at it.
"One says this, one says that", he murmurs.
Ostrava is becoming a big deregulation lab.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are still not on the market.
Aktuality.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Havirov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and is already full at 9am on Tuesday.
There's a security guard from the security agency right next door with a pager.
"Rent 2011", a special button lights up on his touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your cipher is beeping on a big display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're up.
After a while, an elderly couple comes to ask about the rent, but the crowds in the waiting room are clearly not concerned with the new rent.
Most people came to deal with ordinary problems as before - claims for repairs, insurance claims, and so on.
Letters with new lease agreements have been sent to the post office boxes of most of the RPG portfolio's 44,000 apartments in Ostrava since mid-November.
RPG Apartments in their letters suggests a rent increase of 15 to 38 percent.
A special door for new rentals was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been going on for a week, so it's just in the pipeline", the workers behind the barrier respond after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former mines of the Baka is a hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the CPSU took him up quite loudly, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"I've been looking for a new floor for 20 years".
"They didn't even change my toilet seat", says the man mentioned at the outset.
Most of the workers say they come to see if they can get a discount on their rent if they sign up on time, as RPG promises in the special offer.
Half the discount on the February rent will be given to all tenants who sign a new lease by December 15th.
But the question mark of the Havier deregulation is definitely not crowded.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here for the 2011 lease", estimate the workers behind the barrier.
RPG proposes individual contract negotiation on its website and boards wherever it is needed.
However, if the parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but an information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal process", RPG warns on its website.
"No one will be judged here", one of the RPG Apartment workers thinks, and the man on the street outside the customer center partly agrees.
"I have 13,000 in pension and 5,000 left to eat, I don't have to judge myself", he claims.
But the maid will not be able to find out.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaoralalek tells them not to sign in the media, so people wait", he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent is still not even enough to maintain the housing stock", says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio at RPG Byty, who points out that the main reason for the increase in rents is the neglect of the housing stock, which the angry tenants are blaming.
While RPG could invest 4 billion in housing in the five years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to invest 5.2 billion.
A large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats in the waiting room repeats several red-highlighted messages.
'The increase in rents in 2011 by 15% and less affects 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments.'
"And it's always going to be at most $0.50 per square foot and month", it pops up on the screen.
For just 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio, rents will rise 38 percent.
'In these cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19,66 per square metre,' RPG points out.
The rent for 2,600 apartments will stay the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation won't eliminate rents in a flash, but will be spread out over four to eight years.
It also adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back into the apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
The preferred way to get them is for people to sign a rent increase agreement.
The offices include a kindergarten, the architects understood.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to also hide a miniature school with all the amenities - colorful walls, fancy furniture, a stack of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it's been open to children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings have emerged, has been planning space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly in the baby boom era, and it was important to her that women designers and architects could get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of part-time work, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social programme.
This allows builders and architects to combine the demanding work of caring for a child.
The mini-school was conceived by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the Czech State Budget.
The grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to purchase equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy is exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and was substantially assisted by Economy Rating in applying for a grant.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are cared for by a nurse and a primary school teacher, so children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, but most are over 3 years old.
Since it is a "mini-school", only five children can be present at a time, but more children are taken in during the day.
The daycare is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the daycare regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework curriculum of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they also receive a quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school, including English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and games but also with a computer for the children to use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and avoid stressful situations of late pick-up from preschools far from their parents' workplace.
This makes working time more productive for parents.
Not surprisingly, a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship develops here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this programme it has strengthened its personnel marketing.
The house of bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies have open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The organic shapes of the house have earned it the nickname "The House of Bones".
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and the ubiquitous soft curves, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The façade of the house features dreamlike lines, soft colors, and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When you look closely, you can see geometry, rhythm, and a very thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, illuminated to enhance the glow of the colors.
The curvature and twisting of shapes is also found in the interior.
The wood in the waves mimics window frames, railings, door decorations, peepholes, and bars.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district at 43 Passeig de Gracia, a busy shopping street, was built by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist named Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon adopted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Chinatown Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudi did not design it himself.
He was a collaborator of architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the Casa Batlló house designs started a successful collaboration between Jujo and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Güell Park, which houses other works by Gaudí.
Soon after its completion, the house earned the nickname "The House of Bones" from the locals because of its organic shapes.
Others have come to call it the "wiggling house" because of its specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on the top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs also include other sculptural features.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house, with vents and chimneys.
Strange as it may seem, their 45-degree slope.
Gaudí was totally disrespectful of the building codes of the day and was not bound by them.
Although he obtained a building permit from the city at the beginning of the project, the details he gave about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the project was completed, the city council was appalled and demanded a repair.
For example, the council was concerned that the construction interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, the correction never took place: just 15 days after the city asked for it, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) a lease for the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
The second floor gallery had a social room and the third floor had a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is traversed by a flight of stairs leading up to the roof terrace itself.
The basic elements of the reconstruction were the elimination of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connectivity.
The social area can be fully connected by opening the living room door and a larger company can communicate comfortably without losing the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has gained, in addition to the new facade, an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles that line the inner courtyard, and fireworks, too, is impressive.
The two-color play provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
All you had to do was bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005, is open to the public.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided to do so in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the inspections, finding it a very profitable business, and extended the inspections to include common and attic areas, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee is certainly not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The amount is far more than the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of a dragon tower house, you must quickly befriend one of the tenants and visit him directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: Women have different requirements than men
Not the luxurious frame of the bed, but the quality of the reclining area, the mattress and the grille, provide the basis for a truly good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complementary to suit a particular user.
Many factors determine the choice, from weight, height, age, health, and even the owner's gender.
The type of interior in which the mattress and grille are fitted is also important.
Typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages where bathing is not a regular occurrence because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them regularly.
Because if they do not have many vents in the core and are still on solid board, they retain moisture: Mold may also appear underneath.
It's also a matter of habit.
If you have spent a long time abroad, where high-end softener mattresses are often used, you may find it difficult to feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
"I guess all the hockey players coming back from the NHL complained that they weren't sleeping here".
"They needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam on their battered shoulders, heels, and hips".
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that makes them poorly 'read' joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamczik, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players and other customers were therefore looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today, it's fine, the mattress is suitable for Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed, or it adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't roll over at night like after a hard fight.
You'll just sleep better.
The foam rope also acts as a protection against overhangs.
When choosing a mattress size, add to your height the length of your foot, which is usually about seven to nine inches [21-34 cm].
So a man and a woman who are about 6'2" tall need a bed that's 6'2" to 6'4" tall.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, or 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"The rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly curled up in your elbow", advises Helena Prokopová, a certified master of the Association of Tapestry and Decorators, who has spent many years studying and lecturing at vocational schools on the subject of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics.
For a double bed, each person needs his own grill and mattress, but be careful when buying mattress heights.
Otherwise, you will have to install bars of varying heights, but you may not be able to do that for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring-loaded mattresses at least 15 cm high, of which at least 3 cm should be used for the forming and cushioning layer.
"You can't feel the springs when you touch your hands or sit on a mattress", warns Helena Prokop.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grill.
A full-fledged bed, where the mattress and the mattress are like Siamese twins, they have no room in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their sheets cannot be washed, which is common today.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters [0.75 to 0.75 L] of sweat a night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will resemble a large (and clogged) mesh.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about mattress life up to 25 years or even lifetime warranties.
But everything has its "buts".
So, a practical advice from the vendors: for a mattress that is 4 or 5 inches wide, keep the removable coating on and use a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly made today with the entire perimeter stretched out, so that when unzipped, we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!), still, the handling of larger types (and one person) in the image could resemble a fight between lightweight and heavyweight in the ring.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a grill?
I never did!
Maximum for a bed reserved for one-night visits.
However, if the board does not have any ventilation holes, use a mattress with a spring frame at least 15 cm high, springs in bags (including Taschenfederkern) and a cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses are not suitable for this type of mattress.
For non-slotted slats with 14 to 18 slats, latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut) are appropriate, but you will always benefit from slats with more slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the thigh area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning lamella grille does not include mattresses with a spring frame, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can be provided.
It is a special attachment that allows the blade to be pushed or even tilted so that the shoulder is able to fall back into place.
For men who have "shoulders over their backs", definitely a big deal.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, using a softener in the shoulder area of the "men's" mattress.
They also remember women - giving them a softer surface in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, multi-torque wing or plate grills are available.
Pressure spreads out to multiple points and the voltage drops.
Be careful, though, that once you use the wrong pillow (large and "pumped up") on the right mattress and grill, most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: The pillow should support the head and touch the shoulders with its tips only to relax the shoulder muscles.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on your side, the pillow should balance (along with the shoulder cradle grill or softened zone in the mattress) the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straw-filled beds.
The fact is that they are increasingly made with natural materials or at least ingredients.
The trend is just for the mattress bio.
The raw materials from petroleum, from which polyurethane foams are produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as hops and soybeans.
I think all the major manufacturers are using soy.
"Bio means that the core is made of a material of pure natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to micro-capsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There's also a division for men and women.
While the man is "cooled" by birch extract to absorb heat and cool the body, the woman is "melted" by the mattress.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Favorite of the day?
The mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, is thus more breathable than regular polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips, and heels should be.
A good mattress costs from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health criteria have a lower VAT rate, they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattresses and grills is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, manufacturers or retailers may offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn into the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The other one is available for free.
The era of lazy, or viscoelastic, foams with open cell structure and high density was ushered in by the "cosmic" pace of the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous overload when they launched.
Tempur softens in the heat, but hardens in the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warmth of the human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal for preventing bedwetting but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in medical products, such as special foot pads that lighten the feet and the vascular system.
Domestic producers use, for example, Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents want tracking devices to keep tabs on their kids
Fear of their own child is leading more and more people to the idea of GPS babysitting.
The system, originally designed to track cars, can also track people's movements, helping in cases like the disappearance of nine-year-old Anicka Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it may be just as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the disappearance of Anicka and began to wonder how best to protect their children.
Even if it means violating their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not a spy operation, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, a supplier of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that there are cases where such devices can be misused, such as when they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not seen such cases".
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons", Pilin added.
He said that a child should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bochková points out that if a child does not want to wear something like this, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose things when they don't want to be in control".
"Parents used to have high expectations for cell phones, but they can be turned off just like these surveillance devices", says Bočková.
It also disputes whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of an impending kidnapping, the perpetrator almost always ensures that the child has no electronics that could reveal his location".
"Now it's a phone".
"As surveillance devices become more widespread, they will also be sought out, "because their sales will be fueled by massive advertising".
"In this case, criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says a psychologist.
However, he admits that similar devices can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, a company that provides surveillance services for both cars and people, even if the surveillance device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
'The device can be set to periodically transmit a position after a certain time.'
"In the event of damage, at least the last known location of the person concerned shall be available".
"More expensive devices have built-in tiltometers, so that even if you slip and lie still, the device will send an immediate position warning", says Čech.
He says that a similar service can be provided by a smart phone with a navigation system, which can be accessed by downloading special software.
The problem with today's surveillance devices is that they are either devices the size of matchboxes or smaller cell phones.
They're always in danger of being lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"The biggest advantage of this is that the attacker may not have to recognize the tracking device at all".
"Or it will only recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time", he adds.
Whether the tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they'll still use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
It is a combination of GPS (which uses standard car navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the vehicle's current position.
The army has enough firepower to wrap around the Czech Republic, but it'll only last two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of explosive detonating ropes.
Last year, the Department of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cable to the warehouse.
The army has enough for 225 years.
The problem is, the life of the cord is two, four years at the most.
The army bought the ignition cords from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a large quantity of match cords, wrote that soldiers use 40 miles [60 km] of match cords a year in training.
However, the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, show that then all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
The Minister of Defence, Alexander Vondra, and the Commander of the Armed Forces, Vlastimila Picka, are not excluded.
That alone would justify the army's annual consumption of 40 miles of matches.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves would last for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, the experts say that the basic training of each new professional requires no more than six feet [2 m] of match rope, the army has secured fresh purchases - even with increased use of enlisted or special forces - for the 225 years mentioned.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondrov that they had almost no ammunition for their small arms, so even the firing was limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I can't believe they keep buying so many matches from us".
"But it's their choice, and they know what's good for them".
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as businessmen try to satisfy", says Jan Děcký, business manager of STV Group.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek also justifies the hundreds of kilometers of purchased ropes by saying that the army will have a supply of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, speaks of a lighter's lifetime of only four years and police or military pyrotechnics even two years.
"In perfect storage, it could be the four of them", says one soldier who, because of his criticism of the military, does not want to be named.
After the expiration of their service life, each round must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
The other argument the department makes is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of ignition cords.
"We were 60 percent less expensive than last year's delivery of 250 miles", explains Pejšek's spokesman for the Ministry of Defense's purchasing opinion.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firing cords by police firefighters who destroy munitions from World War II or the post-Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only so much that they use up the ammunition before it expires.
It has proven itself to be a safety measure for pyrotechnicians and can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of ropes more flexibly.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulty in disposing of tens of thousands of tons of Warsaw Pact ammunition as the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army prepared to march on the Rhine.
The Czech, according to the pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, will face the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which it buys "cheaply" today.
I still draw on the contacts I made through the contest
The winning place in the Businessman of the Year competition helped Lukas Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the Businessman of the Year competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke the Clown liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
With savings from foreign brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-destroyed house with five apartments.
For a third-year college student, that was a lot of courage.
"The quality-price ratio of our accommodation at the time made me want to try something", says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first apartment renovated began to rent to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, in seven years, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun Design Hotel.
But this year, he's got another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel on the island of Tisza, where we have sold our franchise concept, and other applicants for the Pytloun hotel franchise are applying", says last year's number one businessman.
"And the winning of the 'Businessman of the Year' competition was a big part of the reason for this sale of the hotel licence", adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the streets, often giving me additional congratulations, and I must say that it was nice", he recalls.
I highly recommend the contest to anyone who's trying something.
It's not even necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have otherwise.
"Some of the people I met through the competition I started doing business with regularly".
He said the credit for success was going to somehow go to every employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I notice more loyalty and pride in being part of something that has gained universal recognition".
"It's far from just my personal success, it's the result of all of our hard work together".
"Only my name is put in the foreground", says Lukáš Pytloun, a modest man today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmett.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the determination of the winner, Farmet's worst days are behind him.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, won first place in the Vodafone Firm of the Year competition.
The jury praised the efforts he made to build a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions from a small tool shop in Česká Skalica.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence to compete", says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karl Žďárský's father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the Communist-confiscated property, he did not hesitate long to refuse a career in the company where he worked at the time and, with a few friends around his father, started a company for plastic baths.
Soon after, they specialized in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, it became the largest automated press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company has gained greater recognition even among the lay public after its success in competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to see Farmet much better, but also foreign partners have started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
But the past year has not been all euphoria over victory at Farmett.
The valuation was based on the company's financial results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the toughest year ever for sales of engineering products.
The crisis was at its peak, but the people were not so affected, and companies stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, has not escaped us either".
"The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take unpopular measures on occasion.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, albeit less so than before the crisis.
What Farmett has not let go of, however, is the investment in research and development.
"With the grants we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence at international fairs, won top prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are rising again, and with them the number of new hires.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
The survey that removes pointless regulations
The Absurdity of the Year poll is the fourth installment of the entrepreneurial slaughter.
Some of the nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of another year's Absurdity of the Year poll was the requirement to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible online to officials.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper business register statement, although an official could obtain it with two mouse clicks.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register when checking the insurance payers", said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
To shed light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to abolish the nonsensical ones is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth edition of the business festival organised by the Economic News and is becoming increasingly popular with the public.
If last year about 3,000 voters took part in the vote, this year there were almost 4,000.
And no wonder, all kinds of legal obligations that serve only to deter business, we still have plenty and enough.
"We are among the world leaders in the number of tax return slips", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, the ease of doing business has become a proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared with the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving much.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first announced in 2006 and is held every year according to the same script.
Anybody can apply for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September each year, when the competition closes.
The competition organiser will then select seven candidates for the "anti-sen" and have them voted for by the public online during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey has received more than 100 applications, 105 specifically, for meaningless regulations and regulations.
Businessmen, unions and journalists have been sending in tips.
Among the "finalists" in the competition were a requirement that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The competition, which takes place every early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the Opening Ceremony, which regularly attracts political and social figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted in this culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing sticks under the feet of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish every year at least three dozen paragraphs that today unnecessarily complicate business", said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to overturn senseless regulations do not seem futile.
In 2007, the most troubling was the obligation for entrepreneurs to notify three days in advance to the trade office where a permanent establishment is located of their intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed by the new Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a business trip of up to 30 days for its foreign employee, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of everything good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation that physical therapists have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two scale-ups in their office.
This was mitigated this year by a health department order - the refrigerator requirement was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sport projects shall be evaluated.
The new feature of the competition, now in its fifth year, is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The purpose of this competition is to promote sound and fair business practices.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, the mobile operator which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
In this first year of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Firm 2010 main competition, companies applying for the competition are those for whom business success is not the only long-term goal.
Each of these stories is very inspiring and could be used for a separate article.
Although their subject matter is diametrically different, the common denominators of their efforts are support and consideration.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people affected and in another, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
Among the 14 nationwide finalists was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contributor to a foundation fund for disabled children for 17 years.
The paper mill in Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won by introducing flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionate reduction in pay.
The jury also awarded the title to her for buying primarily from Czech producers, promoting civic activities in the surrounding area and protecting the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluše Ryznarová, managing director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecký region, meanwhile, is concerned about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"We also support the Human in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a company representative.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní a Čistila z Karlovy Roku, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We, in turn, contribute to food, transport, training and recreation", says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically entered by all regional finalists of the Vodafone Companies of the Year contest who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organisers by 15 August at the latest.
In the absence of any other comments, the conclusions set out in recitals (43) to (44) of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
'If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' Vodafone Company of the Year competition.'
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, as it is a sub-category of the main competition, the Firm of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose organising agency.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested in a public competition
The building of the Land Fund in Pilsen was arrested by the anti-corruption police in recent days.
Detectives have placed a local media entrepreneur and real estate developer Luboša G.
The applicant allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender for the settlement of restitution claims in order to attract specific bidders for the land offered in the tender.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns to Luboša G.
"So far I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for forgery in a public procurement and a public competition", said Antonia Zelená, head of the Plzeň prosecutor's office, adding that no further details could be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
In the light of the minimum of official information, it is possible to speculate on how it might have affected public competition.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá, when asked about the law, said that the police did arrest people at a separate workplace in Pilsen, during a public competition.
"It was a client, not an employee", she said.
According to Černé, the tender is properly entitled 'Call for tenders for land transfer claims under the Land Act' and is held when more than one eligible applicant is interested in the land offered.
'These persons offer, under the call, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land.'
'The order of the purchasers is determined by the claims offered and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has offered the highest claims,' explained the spokesperson for the fund.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who had applied for the tender and, as he himself is also the eligible person, having acquired a number of restitution claims, offered the land applicant not to participate in the tender.
He must have collected severance pay for it.
That would explain the large amount of money he had on him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had outstanding contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing a restitution of land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired land from the fund for the construction of public transport, specifically at the site where the motorway to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he exchanged it very favorably with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
The city council had to do something about it, because otherwise, blocking the land would jeopardize the project.
Households pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra for all kinds of energy, including water, heating, and even rent.
From January, families will have to spend up to a hundred dollars more per month than they do now.
Electricity will rise by as much as 4.6 percent, gas will rise by about 2 percent, water will rise by as much as a tenth in some cities, and central heating will rise in many places.
Electricity prices should cost households in apartments a hundred crowns more per year than now.
All major suppliers have reduced their prices for power generation, which is due to a significant increase in support for renewable energy, in particular photovoltaics.
Gas will rise slightly, but at a time when people are at their most thirsty and thus at their highest consumption.
So they also have to expect hundreds of crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are rising throughout the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by the larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradci Králové will pay about 50 CZK per month more for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 CZK per year.
In turn, Prague's residents are threatened with a 9 percent increase in water and sewer rates if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent stays the same, the baked goods will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the country-wide comparison.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and warehouses are to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rents of 450,000 apartments, where regulations are due to expire in January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who don't agree to the new rent will be sued by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in about 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk on Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka, and, on rare occasions, a better brand of whiskey stolen from my parents.
These are the drinks that most drunks under the age of 15 end up in the care of doctors after drinking.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who have encountered similar cases in the infant ward of hospitals.
"Some beers and wines are completely out of style because it takes a long time to get drunk".
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol", Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's ward at the Hospital of Hořovice in central Bohemia, told Pravda.
"If they can pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, but if not, it's fern and vodka".
"The advantage of vodka is that it is poured into the juice and does not smell so bad", explained the principal.
And the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurin, is right.
"It's usually fern or rum".
"That's modern-day alcohol, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was a plum tree that they brought home", said Jurin.
According to the mayor of Pelican, 13- or 14-year-old drunks in hospital wards are a fairly common occurrence.
Before moving to the mountains, where he's been working since this year, he worked for 10 years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances bring strangled schoolchildren from all over the country.
"One girl in our house was laid about four times".
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought in with an extra 3.5 milligrams of alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a fair in Holešovice at some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours", the principal remarked.
It is the lack of interest or even tolerance of parents in their own children's drinking that is thought to be the main cause of the growing drunkenness of children.
However, experts say that children are not addicted in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholic refers to a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the associated symptoms, and this is not the case in children".
"Those who repeatedly use alcohol are more likely to be characterized by a failed family-social background", explained Mayor Pelican.
According to Jurin's spokesman, this year, the Motola pediatric clinic had hospitalized about 40 drunk children by mid-November.
But only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who take their parents away from the hospital or are taken home by the police do not count.
Aside from the cases where children sit around after school and drink a bottle of booze, there are three seasonal fluctuations that Pelican says can be relied upon: witches, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"Either they're drinking their grief over a bad grade or they're celebrating the start of the holidays".
"But for a witch, I've seen seven child drunks at once", said Pelican.
Paradoxically, a drunk who spends the night in detox under the supervision of a doctor has an advantage over one who suffers a nasty hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose will be relieved by a water infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they have a good wake-up call after a wonderful evening experience and they're not in pain".
"They're just confused about where they are", admitted Pelican, adding that he sometimes spoils patients' good spirits at least by listing the costs of their treatment.
An ambulance and an emergency hospital bed can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
"I sometimes used it as an educational tool, telling the children directly at the visit how much their drinking cost and that they could also spend the summer on the job to make money on that one party", Pelican added.
However, he said, health insurance companies do not pursue recourse procedures to recover treatment costs from parents in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159s out of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to Seville, Spain, where the Casa aircraft manufacturer EADS is based, on Tuesday.
It's the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been overseas for training or demonstration flights.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army and was airworthy.
The remaining three are single-seat L-159s.
They're currently in storage at the Air Waterfalls, and a brokerage firm, Omnipol, took them over last week.
When the planes will physically leave the waterway, according to Jan Pejšek from the press department of the defense is not yet known.
'The single-seat L-159s for replacement were separated from the long-term storage aircraft without further input and investment by the Department.'
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and form", Pejšek told Pravda.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, since the ministry signed a 200 million kroner contract with AER Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unneeded L-159s into two two-seaters.
One new plane was delivered to the Army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Peshke, EADS has committed to putting the planes into the arsenal of some Allied country.
'The contract clearly states that the L-159s will be purchased by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.'
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this", Pejšek said.
The business newspaper said some time ago that the Spanish army, for example, is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirko Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defence leadership at the time argued that in return they would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest it wants to sell.
The purchase of the Casa planes will probably have a legal spin.
The European Commission had sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of a European-wide tender rather than by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a finger longer than the ring finger have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That's the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It could be related to the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", says study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors, such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a finger on their right hand that was shorter than a ring finger.
They were as likely to get prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same finger length.
But for those with longer fingers than rings, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men by age 60, it dropped by 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the baby is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is consistent with a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is what promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he was only briefly aware of the study but that he did not think the link between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is covered in snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly snow-covered, and in many places, road workers have been driving all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of both trucks and passenger cars and also stands near D1 in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by the dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK).
There was a truck crash at mile 91, two trucks collided at mile 93, and the accident resulted in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should get off just behind Brno at kilometer 190 or go through Brno and then ride at kilometer 182 at Kývalka.
Columns form for miles.
There's also an accident on the D11 motorway, just before entering Prague.
In Prague, there are several inches of snow, and the temperature is minus seven degrees Celsius.
The car columns are formed on the average, the traffic jams are also in the Sterboholska.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague crisis team is meeting again at 8:00 a.m.
Railways and airports are also struggling.
The Czech Railways have already had to cancel seven express services due to snow.
The line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun, for example, is having problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are now paved, but only with extra care.
In Vyškovsk there are three impassable side roads, in Brno there are places where snow tongues form and in Blanensko there are necessary to overcome some of the high-altitude roads in the snow chain.
The worst affected areas were in Vyškovskoye.
So far, there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milešovice.
They'll need to be stretched with cutters.
When they'll be cleared, we can't say yet.
Caution is advised in Hodonín in the White Carpathians.
The roads, which are maintained only by inert rainfall for nature protection, have up to a three-inch [5.0 cm] layer of snow, said the Czech National Television.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of snow fell, with the heaviest snowfall in the northern Czech Republic, often as much as 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, about six inches of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually receding.
The U.S. military has a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new automatic rifle will influence the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a little super precision cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm rounds developed for this rifle, containing high explosive, actually function as small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
The top is usually unprotected, and a lethal shower of steel fragments can knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier's basic approach is to find a target, send a laser beam to it, determine its distance, get a precise aiming point, adjust the heading accordingly, and pull the trigger".
"Let's say you measured 1,800 feet".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires a projectile at a distance of 1,400 feet [543] plus, minus one, two, or three feet [1,600 m]", Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace from the current administration building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The computer and computer maintenance giant announced Wednesday that it will move 400 men and women from its current office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyon Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt, in July next year.
According to a spokesperson for Fujistu, an additional 100 jobs of the group, which are currently distributed in the region, are expected to be moved there in the near future.
The lease offer was very attractive and the large office space in Astro Park was more suited to the work style of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was only a rental company.
Competent businessman Bernd Wagner said: "We have found a central headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connectivity to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of a major business within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this had won him a "global player".
It is "a fantastic display of confidence in this site".
Fujitsu is a good fit for the city, and the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
He said the city was informed of his intentions by the company's management.
"Of course we offered the company our help", said Korwisi.
But the friendships did not change the problems the computer manufacturer had with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-Platz.
The result was that economic reasons were decisive.
Now it's a matter of avoiding a long absence from such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative".
The building on Rathausplatz, which has been used by Fujitsu until now, and the adjacent Kleine Vertikale were among the most discussed building projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
The so-called city entrance was created as a joint project between the station and the city hall, which was criticized for the massive construction of areas that previously served as parking spaces and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is described as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides, for example, computers and servers to companies and also provides necessary service.
The Rhine-Mohane branch is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with other subsidiaries in this location being Fujitsu Services and TDS.
In the Astro Park administrative building, 7000 square metres were rented for this purpose.
The complex - whose name refers to a star-shaped floor plan that is twenty years old - is home to the central union of the electrical and electronic industry, among others.
Amazon shut down the server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon Internet Services has disabled the discovery platform on its servers.
It's possible that this was done under political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in the UK.
WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is in hiding, according to a UK newspaper report.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server".
"Free speech in the land of the free", activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had removed the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high number of accesses to documents when publishing secret diplomatic cables.
Using Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the move: "Okay - we're going to spend our dollars now on hiring people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after allegedly investigating by associates of Senator Joe Lieberman, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Affairs Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, reports the British Guardian.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step sooner, given the earlier release of classified information on WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, recklessly and recklessly, endangering our national security and threatening life on the planet", said a statement from a nonpartisan senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to a report in London's Independent newspaper, a 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and Scotland Yard has been told of the exact location.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were also threats.
"There have even been calls for the assassination of Julian Assange".
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to reports from North America.
In the United States, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks leaks to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - apparently ironically - that Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, a verbal exchange erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently published spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of one person with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website".
The U.S. government is now conducting extensive security investigations into its databases.
The special envoy has been appointed by the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" needed after the embassy's reports were leaked to WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire government can share and protect information.
The US government has also announced that it will ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put in danger by a WikiLeaks release.
"We have made every effort to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary".
The University of Ice Cream
At the Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers is in high demand and visitors come from all over the world.
Where do you get that ice cream, anyway?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech ice cream parlor, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator, wipes it into the pad and sells it.
You don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna to find out.
But if you want to learn even more about ice cream, you can't miss "Gelato-University" by the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker established an ice cream university to bring the ice cream from its machines into line with the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for the future Gelatieri is in great demand and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also special courses on chocolate ice cream and an apprenticeship in the ice cream shop.
Some people in their midlife crisis are yearning for a new career, others are venturing onto the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant who wants to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars - and Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only does it taste good but it also has a softness and consistency that are good.
Luciano remembers the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's a little bit of romance".
The first step of manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers - into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees by electronic programming and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then, he turns the tap on the machine and drips pasteurized white cream, the basis of all types of milk ice cream.
The professor is immediately bombarded with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream from only natural materials without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns against being carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Those who say "all-natural" ice cream probably also used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar bean flour.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilizers, but it has to be sold within a day or it will collapse and the customer will eat all the ice.
Certain variations of the basic matter are permitted.
It's more exciting with the aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit section or in the candy section.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force you to use a lot of flavored ingredients".
"But you should just experiment".
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream with a white base that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now he can take an ice cream machine course.
Luciano has them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and cherry ice cream - either with or without eggs as the base, with more or less vanilla flavor, or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall be carried out with fruit ice cream.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - not always better in terms of taste.
Peaches don't have to taste more nutty if they have more peaches.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the mix is balanced does the gelato taste right, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numerical task: If high-sugar peaches are used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a device that measures the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the juice from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the math easier.
Ice cream production is not as physically demanding as it once was.
It is not just a machine for automatically producing the raw material.
There is also a machine that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into cream and cools it to minus one.
With all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Gustavo, a Brazilian, gets himself and his fellow workers all dirty with fruit puree when a giant blender gets out of hand.
"In any course", Maestro Luciano believes, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Auditors in the Double Light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry that experiments with genetically modified plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts called Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well", said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been contracted for several years by the Ilsi lobbying association.
It's funded by companies like Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in the EFSA control regulations for genetically modified plants and thus has a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The EFSA regulations correspond in full paragraphs to the Ilsi documents and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which should be checked by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has raised a conflict of interest.
A senior manager from EFSA recently moved to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any allowances or transition period - and changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) also recently revealed the EU control authority's personnel links to the industrial lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
It works with all reliable data, including industry data, if it is of high professional quality, says one statement.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for assessing the risks of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that GM crops are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt and that the response of GM crops to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize will do in the field", says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how can you find them?" the prosecution asks.
Angelica Hilbeck agrees with that.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the ETH Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying, as in the US, now in Europe, to increasingly influence or discredit critical scientists.
That's why there are almost no scientists left who aren't connected to the corporations.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
"The industry controls the safety research", believes Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, about 400 kilos in total.
Monday night, he was standing outside a train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is familiar: In September, the dredgers came and began to tear off a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was not the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar cut in the train station.
When the construction was halted, most of the wing lay in ruins.
It's broken up into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft coarse stone used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"He must not disappear".
It melts: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and primal".
When he cut one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time .
Uli Gsell is too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former French army munitions depot where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old male, old stone dealer.
He bought all the ones that were made during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed to a gravel or disappeared in a landfill", he says in his office, a wooden booth that was once a guardhouse.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September all the papers said he had bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And if that's the case, then it's probably best to keep the stones in use.
Then about 200 S-21s each took a block weighing about 80 kilograms, costing between $6.50 and $14 a piece.
As a souvenir, some also in the hope of bringing it back when it's rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest sold out.
Gardeners, landscapers, house builders. I'm not going to be around for this.
They came from all corners and dragged everything that could fit in the trunk and the trailer.
The Stuttgart stones of dispute have long since been transformed into "walls" or the edges of herb gardens.
"This stone is not really anything special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political stuff".
He gets in his SUV and goes for a ride around his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, dropped out, then biology, then computer science, and finally became a stone dealer.
And a lover of rocks.
It has 40,000 tons of rock.
He's bringing his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer in old stones in the Republic.
It's braking.
There's an artistically crafted sandstone in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Marien-Bridge in Dresden", he says.
The sandman from the Lab, yellow, gay, he's excited.
"My favourite stone".
We're going up the road through the woods.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And then on.
"Happy travertine".
Once, these suits belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the church of St. Blaise, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what a struggle, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of the way rocks were broken and carried by hand with simple masonry and bull carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be smashed".
He didn't get rich, very rich, not at all.
But today the stone dealer employs 14 people, and up in the forest, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker, and a gardener have settled.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the reviewer.
He's got to go to Cologne soon.
It's also where the stones will be salvaged.
The Battle of the High Potential
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are pushing for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies, like VW, are trying to win the race for the smartest minds and are investing in cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates into the classroom as soon as possible, before they even enter the job market and are taken seriously by others.
Since universities do not publish any student achievement lists, companies seek to find and recruit exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to recruit talent the next day.
A young lady in the personnel department is handing out pens, rubber bears and VW logos.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests ways to the concern.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is managing the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"VW can get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be a good collaborator".
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not uncommon.
But the new thing is, he's so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantive professional project", says Selle.
The fight for freshmen is gonna be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long lists of candidates.
On the contrary, they must endeavour and try to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
Engineering graduates in particular have excellent bargaining power.
According to the VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And according to VDI, the so-called engineer shortage will only increase.
KPMG auditing and consulting company is being hired by Roman Dykta to find talent.
He organizes challenging recruiting events, like the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern-day treasure hunt where participants must find their way around by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the U.S. next year.
Participants can also tour KPMG's branches and get to know the firm.
The participants shall be decided in advance in two selection rounds.
Only Crème de la Crème of the many applicants will fly to the United States.
In the battle for High Potentials in universities, the Dicastery will impose ever-tougher laws.
"We want to be different with our Race".
"A simple sailboat trip was too little for us".
It seems that Dykta's talent scout is in luck.
"We've been in contact with all the participants in similar events last year".
"Some will soon graduate and plan to apply for jobs", he says.
In addition to direct on-campus outreach, SMEs in particular are classically present on the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at trade shows".
"It's like Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at solar equipment manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions listed on the company's website.
"It's difficult to fill the vacancies at the moment".
"It costs a lot of time and money", he says.
Another option is to contact university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors inform us that it is possible to do an internship or write a thesis".
A solar specialist doesn't run any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy, and easy communication.
"Large companies often cannot provide this", says Personal Manager Stübe.
Money has long ceased to be the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good options are other determining factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, staff are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and the framework conditions of the employees are monitored.
The head of the personnel department hopes that the placement will earn her points with job applicants.
"I think that candidates are particularly interested in external evaluations of potential employers", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer through a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Krieger, that means primarily internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your employees", he says.
This is called internal employer branding, or employer market promotion within the employee.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will do their own advertising for their employer among their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a rope", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
No new oil wells will be drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida in the next few years.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban, thereby cancelling the earlier plans for good.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar announced it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should last at least five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig in April.
Before the disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Proponents are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
The focus of criticism is British energy company BP, which is facing billions in claims.
The commission of inquiry, which Obama has commissioned, is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and strict security regulations.
The Audit Office, which has been the subject of numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a major reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the amount of oil produced in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest obstacle to growth in the oil and gas industry", according to a recent survey by consultancy BDO - before a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulations will change".
Investment in new mining projects is being pushed back to recall - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni region burned
The rivers are oil-brown, they smell like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have devastated the environment in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live off stealing, corruption and illegal oil production.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", reassures an environmental activist, "you'll get plenty of oil mud in front of your lens today".
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy roaming his chest in water surrounded by smudges: the scene is almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water glow.
The fact that brown clumps of oil are floating beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen in the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish live: The Ogoni region, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-infected areas in the world.
The entire extent of the desert is yet to be seen as you travel down the river through mangrove swamps with many tributaries.
The boat's engine boils brown porridge instead of clear water, and anyone who dips their hand in the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves stick out of the ground like black licorice sticks, and the rare palm leaves hang sadly.
We search in vain for the flocks of birds that are common in wetlands: Once the boat's engine dies, they roam in their former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
"What is happening here is an ecological war", says Celestine Akpobari, lamenting: "We live in constant fear of health".
The comparison to war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement has been a battleground for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European conquerors came here, the first resistance was formed in the 1980s with the later execution of the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and Shell had to stop production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its workers.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while it is extracting daily from the entire delta area, which is three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipeline, more than two million barrels of black gold, the Ogoni oil field is lying fallow, a situation that is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred feet, steel structures rise out of the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", too affectionately called borehole heads.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty to the bone.
At any moment, Akpobari says, one of these wellheads breaks, and a constant stream of oil leaks into the water.
Experts estimate that over 50 years, more than a billion gallons [2.5 billion L] of oil have been released into the delta's ecosystem: Every year, as much oil as was released into the sea off Alaska in the crash of the Exxon Valdez supertanker 21 years ago - one of the worst environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell attributes sabotage and organized theft of oil to more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists cite bursting wellheads and leaky pipelines as the primary causes.
Shell's requirements in Nigeria are far less stringent than those in the rest of the world, said U.S.-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008.
In what from a distance looks like a deserted, oil-soaked workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: completely naked and up to their necks in oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered across the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline leaks from the pipeline into the containment pot, then kerosene drips from the end of the pipeline, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four 300-liter barrels a day: "We will make N34,000" - about $22 a day.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in Africa's biggest oil state.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be beat by illegal producers: they have raw materials for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to pipelines throughout the Ogoni region, which experts say leaks at least 16 million liters of oil a day throughout the Niger Delta.
But only a negligible fraction of the raw materials in temporary storage are illegally refined: The largest share is loaded onto tankers by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their intervention or the lax production methods, activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies didn't consider themselves invaders and if they didn't so perfectly destroy the fishermen's livelihood, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
Meanwhile, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell, in particular, is so damaged that only a departure from the group is considered: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove better".
Michael is upset.
"Time to get out of here", says the muscle manufacturer.
"The soldiers could be here any minute".
If a special military unit finds them, they're not in danger of prison, but of painful bribery.
Even the soldiers, who are mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This damned thing has brought our country to its knees in every way", says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction defect in the A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety flaw.
Investigators found a possible construction defect in the crashed plane that could lead to "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers may have had better luck than previously thought when they made an emergency landing in early November: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has discovered a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The failure could have serious consequences: cracks could form on one oil pipeline due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a 'catastrophic engine failure'.
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce on 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is a Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian Airlines has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of grounds in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company will file for compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, the parts loosened and damaged the support surfaces.
Rolls-Royce blamed the damage on burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines will need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests on giant aircraft equipped with the engines.
The safety advisory is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security deficiency was considered to be sufficiently significant to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of Qantas, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of one A380 as a safety measure.
A double-decker is the largest passenger jet in the world.
Snowfall across the country will cause traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost all the country had snow overnight.
Many roads are in disarray, trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Germany is freezing in winter: Almost the entire country was covered in snow on Thursday night in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to six inches [15 cm] of snow may be found in some places.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation but could not handle the new snowfall.
In addition, there was a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a storm surge of 1.2 metres above normal in the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein this morning.
Snowfall caused considerable problems on the motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia, the worst-weather forecast ever, the purple alert was the highest ever in Saxon Switzerland.
Some 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, and strong, fresh winds caused thunderstorms.
Several trucks and vans were left overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major problems on the roads.
Wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic jams on A2.
In Durinsk, there were problems with snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Düren and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
He had to stop at Saalfeld in Düren for an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers on the train were provided with blankets, food and drink by firefighters and rescuers.
The snow wind is blowing across the road.
Many flights at major German airports were canceled because of the snowstorms.
According to a spokesman for the Central Flight Information Center, there have already been reports of cancelled flights from Munich.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, it has been cancelled for 40 years, according to a Fraport spokesman.
Road maintenance is on a continuous roll.
Although few passengers are left without connections at the airport, 400 bunk beds are available.
There were many accidents on the roads on Wednesday evening.
A truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snow on the road. A truck was also caught at a railway crossing because it was stuck.
The driver is dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which was closed from Bayreuth to Nuremberg until the early hours of the morning.
And on top of that, a 30-year-old woman died after her car rolled over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the good news is that the snow will remain in the form of light snow, and so it will lift even with light wind gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be strong winds of the strength of a gale.
But it's going to be a very cold winter - up to minus 15 degrees locally.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for the twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is bidding farewell to its brand: According to a newspaper article, the bank is looking for buyers for two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could be worth up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district were modernized; meanwhile, bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group is apparently seeking to recover the renovation costs - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, reports the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still looking at whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again", he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany is thus once again relinquishing its registered office after a short period.
The Bank took over the twin towers from equity investors for EUR 272 million only in mid-2007 and subsequently carried out costly renovations.
The energy conversion project is estimated to have cost around EUR 200 million.
I think the sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
According to a newspaper article, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed Greentowers, at around EUR 500 million.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to the sunken miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
Still no one has been rescued from the dead as the security situation in the mine continues to be complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners, aged 17 to 62, were found in the mine.
A probe was launched into the mine where the accident occurred, but found no sign of life.
Due to the high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, emergency crews were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second powerful explosion, authorities and experts assumed that the miners had no chance of survival.
Still no luck in freeing the dead.
Now the dead are honored by relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on New Zealand's South Island, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the fallen miners, 29 tables were set up with helmets, lamps, and names of the miners.
Also, pictures and personal items like clothes and surfboards have found their place.
The flags were flying at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would again come out of the "depths of the earth", New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the memorial gathering.
"But they never came home".
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in a mine.
The memorial service was attended by the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, as well as several foreign diplomats.
British and South African miners were also involved in the explosion on November 19.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the poisonous gases have dissolved, the high temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with the warriors!
Is horror good for art house?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to push back the old boundaries with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents at large with almost supernatural force - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself to brutal killing methods and even rips his enemies' guts out of their bellies alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed Man, as he is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters either utter one or two sentences at most or are carried away to the anguished dying cries.
Otherwise, it's silent and revels in the horrifyingly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good when a film has multiple audiences, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to bring his works either more mainstream humor or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of arthouse cinema seem to be deterred by the brain and guts that are splashing everywhere.
Action movie fans will be bored at the latest when, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the One-Eyed Man sets sail with a group of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and hangs there forever in the wind and fog before the crew apparently sails to America and remains silent.
It is no wonder, then, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" was not released in theaters and is now available only on DVD.
It's a shame, not only because of the beautiful footage, but also because behind the distinctive facade, with its blood-stained spots, there's a thrilling cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or exact plot, it's all about atmosphere, a feverish dream that became a movie.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn does not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling images and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that gushes from the characters' hearts.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed Man will retain something of his innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become in time enemies and temporary allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It represents destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA's nuclear power agency has a new alert about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression and will not allow inspection.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It is located on the Euphrates River, and the nearest major city is 20 miles [30 km] away, called Dair as-Saur.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents her name as a reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns off the current.
According to a CIA report from late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - which could be used to build nuclear weapons.
The 1950s technology is useless for anything else.
The CIA has released a video of the unfocused satellite images.
She used computer animation to pinpoint where the reactor components might have been before the destruction. It's supposed to be a scaled-down replica of a North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, photographs were presented that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
He said the reactor was just about to start, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the riddles have grown larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was very sure that Syria was building an al-Kibar reactor, but had virtually no evidence that the country had an "active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious, only mentioning the "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA presentation "credible".
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how he was sure he had the reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said last summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The rubble of what were said to be "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared and the Syrians also leveled the ground properly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the time immediately following the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - possibly Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program, nor did it build a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damasek said.
But the IAEA disproved that after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, he banned auditors from a second inspection in al-Kibar and from accessing the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment", confirmed the then-ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in a recent official statement.
The investigation has dragged on since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious problem for the credibility of the agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's Vienna headquarters admitted - a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons, which the agency oversees.
The IAEA sees three more facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and still exist - as the key to progress.
The auditors have not yet said what the devices are, what their function is or why they are suspect.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, DC, identified these objects and found a building complex in satellite imagery that is likely one of the suspected objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason Syria denies the IAEA access to these three sites.
There was a report in Vienna that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to locate military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by U.S. intelligence.
The IAEA has documentation and satellite imagery that material was transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one should be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", that is, uranium enrichment and reprocessing, processes necessary to produce nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium came from and where the plutonium for the bomb would later be separated from it, these central questions are only a matter of conjecture.
It is also unknown whether debris that could hide important traces is stored at these three sites.
Hundreds of truckloads seem to have disappeared from the surface of the earth, and no one seems to have any information as to where the cargo ended up.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and across the Euphrates, which Syria inspected in 1998 as a suitable storage site for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But space images show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria conducted ground work at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicions.
Moreover, diplomatic sources say that the IAEA spent many months developing a plan for the auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much the auditors are interested.
Damascus, meanwhile, has rejected this proposal as well.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring us that the reactor was destroyed and that's why it wasn't on fire, for months now, the US ambassador, Glyn Davies, has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the toughest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who is expected to propose the inspection, has already spoken of "a possibility I'm leaning towards in the future", but is hesitant.
This choice carries a great risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented have no clear interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "what happens if they end up finding nothing?"
Love in a Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her still-untitled directorial debut last summer, trouble has been brewing.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is not yet known - but this too is a cause for concern.
There's a persistent rumor that this woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been completed in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to Jolie through the UN refugee agency UNHCR and asked to meet with the actress, according to a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the UN refugee agency's ambassador.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they turned her down.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims is telling a lot about the script.
Her organisation has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be fired as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had read her script, allowed the filming to take place in Sarajevo after some delays - it is not clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that she has no political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great effort, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
It remains uncertain as to its content.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers met before the war started and meet again when she is a Bosnian Muslim woman, dragged into a Serbian camp where he is a guard.
Which is a lot different than "rape victim falls in love with her tormentor".
The fact that Jolie's movie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie says the pressure is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now they can get her out of jail by Hollywood hackers illegally posting her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
Tonight is another good night for the Irish.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates their hosts Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans are shouting for joy at the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is heating up as players throw tennis balls 10 feet into beer mugs - and they hit each other.
Beer pong is called bizarre theater and you can win 500 euros as the prize and a ticket to Las Vegas for the world beer pong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and the restrained computer guy, they don't really go together.
Yet a 26-year-old man tries to entertain, to distract from the burdensome question of what the future holds.
His plan isn't a gambling passion in Vegas, he's going to New Zealand in January for an interview.
"I have a strange feeling about it", he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job yet".
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as an Event Manager instantly, maybe that's a good sign", the young man says, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving, just like the Tanners, and it seems like a lot of families on the island are.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts at the ESRI Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin predict.
They even count 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For such a small country of only 4.5 million people, this is a major loss.
If predictions are true, there will be a wave of immigration similar to the one that Ireland suffered in the 1980's.
After a decade of prosperity, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly troubling the young, educated Irish, who have so far only experienced a boom.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
There was a need for everyone, money was scarce.
Meanwhile, three out of every ten women and men are unemployed by the time they are 30.
The Irish Times has many letters from readers complaining: "Everything is going downhill in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, they're leaving and our country loses a generation".
"The last one please turn off".
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees the future as bleak because the government is lying and fails to offer young people any prospects for the future.
"They're cutting the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid internship to another.
Her biggest worry is that she's gonna have to move out on her own in four years.
"That thought is sad and depressing".
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the issue in a positive light.
McLarnon organises the 'WorkingAbroadExpo', an exhibition offering a full service on the subject of working abroad.
"For those just starting out in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take their first steps up the career ladder", says the manager.
His website features photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, it's freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known for six months what it's like to build something else.
Having no work in Ireland, the 29-year-old engineer now works with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
He's going to Hannover or Berlin in January for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off his mortgage at home.
"It's a little crazy sometimes", he says as he steps outside his own home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not actually in".
She laughs embarrassedly and walks through cold rooms.
The little house is in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, big expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions", he says.
Afraid the loan might not work out?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea, and says, "I have no children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again".
A civil engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often these days.
"No one needs to go hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll feel Irish".
He laughs and then he tells about his father who left for England during the last recession.
"After seven years he was back and life in Ireland went on, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep the future open and just wait for life to unfold elsewhere.
He's also worked in London for a few years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there's one thing that's been worrying him a lot these days: his 27th birthday party on Friday in Dublin.
She's worried she might mess up at the prom.
"No emotion at all", he says, and he drinks a big beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing".
"Let's call it a going away party, just plain simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The usual practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Criminal activity is a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of a recent Latinobarometer survey of 18 countries published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
In this year's survey, which was conducted in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a pretty cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific Rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are of Democratic belief, which is below the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy operates in practice in their country, the same as last year but a large increase compared with 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said they trusted the parliament in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support arose during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries had only suffered a brief recession and were enjoying a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, mood varies widely from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that they or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but this is down from 38% last year and also the lowest number since 1995.
The stronger economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will enable their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share this view (and 80% support private enterprise there), even though their leftist president Hugo Chávez is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has the leading position in the field, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
The Election Criticized
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help a country that's been hit to be afraid.
The election meant filling of ballot boxes and repeated voting, ballots scattered through the sewers, smashed polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several would-be candidates, have been shouting that this is a fraud and calling for the election to be called off.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior U.N. official in Haiti, stated that "in many respects, it was a pretty good election".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean said cautiously that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show must go on.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have withdrawn from their original call to invalidate the vote.
But a problem could arise if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no support among voters, is branded by the Election Commission as having won the decisive contest.
With a devastating cholera epidemic and more than a million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but disorganization prevented them from doing so.
Some 250,000 identification cards, which are essential for voting, remained unclaimed just before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it's clear that Haitians are going to do it themselves.
Top to center
In the weeks since her sudden widowhood, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has been enjoying public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in office in next year's election may depend on whether the grieving Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued his economic policies after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their extra income as they pleased.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized by the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (with slaps and accusations of government corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", the president said.
The 2010 budget will now extend to next year, giving the president more leeway to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to reach 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speak of a figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 as Argentina was gripped by economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction over controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, he burdened the private sector and he purged INDEC, the statistical agency that had taken over the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández moderate this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the increase in world prices for Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on the great devaluation of 2002.
That may be why President Fernández has made it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing a settlement with the creditor governments, who are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be overseen by the IMF, as is usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble the introduction of the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs. Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term ends with her husband no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, who are tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether she will need to quietly renounce many of her husband's political views.
Half the incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother overseas?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, voted for mayors and city councillors in five city districts on November 27, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the prevailing sentiment towards the mainland and has a strong stake in business relations, including the partial free trade agreement, in the biggest straightening of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% for the KMT.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was in the city councils together with the KMT.
The election was held like most Taiwanese elections, involving loud election trucks and mass rallies with flags and sparsely dressed girls.
It even included a mandatory assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien straight through the face, wounding him and killing the spectator.
It was not determined whether the gunman intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, casting suspicion on the DPP and leading voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself was left in the background.
Instead, the candidates have been vocal about plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also stopped inciting anti-Chinese sentiments.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue its commercial bribery along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I'm sure they'd like to see political integration, too, but in order.
It's better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
The DPP has, in any case, discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was in a bad place: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a clear advocate of independence.
But under Ms. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has emerged that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was touted as the DPP's presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the opinion that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting for the choice of potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the runaway pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His dislike seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
The KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly advocated proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens view economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to prominent publicist Antonio Chiang, "the point of no return has already passed".
Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category.
Speaking at the request of the president and the people must be taken notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is being singled out as one of the surprise Grammy Award winners this year with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album Esperanza was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules where an artist cannot release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established".
Her 2010 album Chamber Music Society certainly marked a step forward, and with her carefree vocal style and agile hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as the successor to 2003's Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy judges rightly award Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a snappy New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in a contemporary jazz category that is otherwise favored by albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's wild steampunk-savvy band Secret Society has won several well-deserved accolades in the big band category, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the ever-bold Dave Holland, whose live octave album Pathways provided a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Nominated for Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards are a wide variety of musicians and composers from around the world.
The top two in the nominations are Michael Daugherty and his Deus Ex Machina for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album Dreamhouse, an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also stand a chance at the award.
The classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year category has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album went to Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyric Houston; Kaij Saariah and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who have been nominated for Grammy's for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and the Mandolin Concerto was nominated for Best Instrumental Performance by a Soloist with Orchestra.
The L.A.-based composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avitala, who was performing in concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with Middle Eastern tones and a lot of North African rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral category for conducting the Chicago Symphony in its recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated for vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Planned mosque in Temecula gets approval from planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to a trade freeze.
However, a jury ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically pleasing.
"A lot of good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whoever you can think of", Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen".
"It means justice always wins".
"The opposition is minimal", he added.
"Those who oppose only shout loudly".
"We have some really great people in our valley".
The hearing began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight, with most of the time spent debating with pro- and anti-center people, with the votes evenly split, reports the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America", one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty tucked in the sand".
"America is in decline".
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more convenient space than the warehouse space he shared with a manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in Mediterranean architecture will also have two minarets and rise to a height of 43 feet.
It's supposed to occupy a 4.32 acre lot on Nicolas Road, approximately two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes raise the possibility of new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients opens the door to the search for new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has possibilities beyond the basic elements that have been considered so far.
"This organism has a dual capacity".
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic".
"This is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'alien' life", commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six basic elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur - were considered essential for life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You start to wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report about the discovery, published to discuss it, without revealing the details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life", explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, U.K.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she reasoned that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to substitute for one.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus".
"As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements".
"However, arsenic is so different that it does not function as phosphorus does, and once it enters the body, it starts to work in biochemical processes", Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which allows the bacteria to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the influence of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with the substitution of arsenic, it increases the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example to prove this.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated it might have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been recovered, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a Welsh Pembroke Corgis - went missing on Tuesday after a 2006 Chevrolet Express van was stolen from a night out at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were found later Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They were returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share details regarding their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to talk about it", said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, have not been reached for comment.
They were overjoyed when their two Akitas were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Deputy found the van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akita Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old foal Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were scheduled to compete in this week's regional competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unaccounted for until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they were planning on showing off Trace.
The other dogs were scheduled to compete in other contests scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple's nearly month-long dog show trip.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their cars outside their room windows.
They also took three dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a British Shepherd - and they stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it should be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit so the dogs could get some fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he's offering a reward to anyone who can lead them to the missing dogs.
It was unclear on Thursday if the awards would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the MGM restructuring has received final approval from the court.
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on film and television production and production.
With Thursday's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, MGM has no legal impediments to re-launching Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum as the top executives of the stripped-down studio.
The number of employees will be reduced from more than 400 to around 320.
MGM will not emerge from Chapter 11 abruptly until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned funding resources to allow a $500 million loan to fund MGM's new operations and production.
Now it's a merger with an investment bank that needs $75 million of its own and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million in annual interest payments.
That August, chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Enron CEO and turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial problems and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none were willing to pay the $2 billion plus financing demanded by the creditors.
By the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan, which, after months of discussion and internal disagreement, was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which charge $375,000 a month for their services to run the company, will receive a success fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on the book "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, was looking into merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology Toys to Balance Your Gift Budget
The top contender for this year's iPad is the most amazing toy, followed by the video game system, but in both cases, it's a significant cut in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one Kinect game is worth the equivalent of 10 beaded pickups or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy stores -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club -- and looked at what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's high-tech toys have far more energy, and at the same price, if not a little lower, than in previous years.
While relatively few new toys with affiliated sites have emerged, the two most popular toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the number of toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
With one press, the animal produces a tone, and the second press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years old and up)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch cartoon doll from Elmo Live Technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk the moon with its innovative wheel-locking folding leg.
Children are testing the dance instructor's Mickey, even though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children 3 and up), with a backpack full of quizzes, which are designed to turn driving into a fun work with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you're looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest version with an easy-to-use, qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective a teaching as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children ages 3 to 12), the first major change to the Leapster line from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for children ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for kids 8 and up) is a set of five cubes, no larger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before time runs out; this is great for a makeshift word-making competition.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
The two toys that were most represented in the toy stores were Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child a Club Penguin online toy, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 (for children 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credit at the Club Penguin store for any two items.
That could include roller skates or a Puffle.
Slightly larger than the brush of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children 5 and up), the latest in a line of button-battery microrobots.
The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find his way out.
It's also very resilient.
Our dog was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
Introducing more gentle police control in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in semi-consensus with military authority.
He wanted the female members - the Chinese high-ranking city policemen, feared and despised for their hard-nosedness and penchant for violence - to make an impression on the crowd.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, he whispers softly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood in the spotlight.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the rule.
The four headgear perfectly fits the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average", said Mr. Tang contemptuously.
"Models are pretty".
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city mandated that new goalkeepers have a college education.
Guangdong Province has changed its gray-green uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced stares with powerful weapons: In 2009, one report said that 50 officers surrounded a snack cart and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police force, who have been selected specifically for their looks, proportions and young age.
The goal is to show the police the rough side, but also the gentler, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
They'd argue with the critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei province beat a non-participating spectator to death after he used his cell phone to film their intervention in a landfill protest.
Last year, a training manual for police officers in Beijing was stolen and posted online, including a description of how to beat off criminals effectively without blood traces.
This year, a house-to-house melon merchant in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-sided brain injury.
One violent video game, available for download on the Internet, shows Chinese police officers attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan has scared the government", China Daily, the national newspaper, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
The paper said "a really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics say that approach is not enough.
After the district advertised eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real responsibilities or were just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion".
Adepts should be above average height - more than five feet [1.6 m].
The military service at 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the work is too psychologically demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing", said an unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, allegedly a government website.
"Applicants must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there is character and "inner qualities".
Women are like vases, he said, and he added, "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district administration, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that the height requirements are common in China for other jobs, both for men and women.
So is the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means the issue of good looks is a hot topic among the Chinese.
Disability or maiming will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or a hunchback to serve with us", said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who is on patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with an apple-like face and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her partner in the doorknob, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city".
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just driving shopkeepers into the alleys where they can conduct their business.
Each morning, the group faces more than a dozen vendors who run around on foot or on bicycles trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being evicted.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu, as the marketman started running, and for a while he left his bicycle with the noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same", said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing as a freelancer.
"Large routine".
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority of their male counterparts to seize goods from vendors.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male superiors.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility to the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that police had killed a shopkeeper.
More than ten police officers or policemen were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square where police officers were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store as required by law.
The owner of the car could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the cops, face-on, elbows against the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Xu Liedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who are no longer in a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in maintaining and refining their image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"It's usually the public that starts it".
The prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure lobbying, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, whose affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very pleased" with the decision, which followed an almost year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of the investigation and that it has no plans to bring any further charges against him in this matter".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times said that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure lucrative lobbying to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as treasurer for the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Because Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was legally barred from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to violate the prohibition against lobbying.
The evidence released "showed a clear case of a conspiracy to violate the law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said the department is cautious about political lawsuits after a series of setbacks, including last year's decision to stay the case against former Senator Ted Stevens amid accusations of misconduct by the state attorney general.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid guns", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the laws", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a call from the DA on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the DA had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecution to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he submitted to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt its investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group alleges that the payment of $96,000 by Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying jobs for was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began lobbying the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "beating" the Home Office on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign announced to reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", she continued.
Cheshire appeals to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them in the courtroom.
They were tweeting about the terrible testimony minute after minute.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter messages dealt with the rape and bed-tying of children in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was scheduled to officially end with the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal with the court with requests and arguments that would likely occupy the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intense reporting of the trial - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate leakage of information with outrageous details then misled the jury in making decisions in terms of influencing public opinion.
This argument could lead a judge to consider whether new rules in the courtroom should also be required as new technologies emerge.
"As I experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technology into the courtroom affects the rights of individuals to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief counsel for Mr. Hayes.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the state Supreme Court, briefly rejected claims regarding last week's ruling, saying that the media had been "carefully vetted" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury was acting under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word on this one.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting on high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision that in Sheppard v. Maxwell, the media-driven trial had a "carnival atmosphere".
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts, reviewing Hayes's ruling half a century later, might be surprised to argue that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms may make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
Counsel also contends that Mr. Hayes may have been biased in his case when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos that would terrify them when they chose a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defense alleges that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly removed a jury member who was critical of the prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury was not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the trial may be of the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate campaigns.
They argued that the media had been constantly fanning the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily influx of media, cameras and reporters in front of the courthouse", wrote the lawyer, "was something that had never been seen before here in New Haven and is perhaps a national rarity".
Their focus on Twitter's impact is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports that came later and that in their view the judicial police should control the scope of further trials.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require courtroom adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' attorneys are seeking that right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 ruling in the Sheppard case, because of the breadth of the process, and they wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century".
Can politeness bridge the gap?
After a campaign that was notable for its insulting and negative nature, a small amount of civility has emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and House leaders yielded no major findings on the key issues that must be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan strife.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close cooperation over several months has built a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still divides the members.
And it's kind of hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now on trial, probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter tolerance for renewed partisan warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday's hearing and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were conducted with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles apart.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington quickly at least.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed", said Pete Wehner, Bush administration administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the party's emotions and then they went quiet.
It's good".
On a number of issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and no one is looking forward to it.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans can't watch as they support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new inaugural treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term goes back to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widespread - that courtesy would lead to real cooperation.
"I look at everything that happens between now and 2012 as a shadow box where the main events will happen in 2012", he said.
The reasons largely have to do with the building of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of overstating their promises, knowing they must keep their promises and cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supporters' lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and are, in their view, putting the pressure on the deficit agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to make their plan official and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among elected officials on the jury who suggest that when it comes to financial issues, we have, at least for today, little basis or will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first begins next year in the form of partisan conflicts, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater partisan cooperation.
What's causing the shift?
It's public opinion.
There's a lot of evidence that despite the partisan nature of the last election, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If it could lead to a stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public reaction very closely.
Anyone threatened with a vote cut is likely to change course and seek compromise.
That can be an optimistic view of things.
The partisanship and orientation is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there's a bigger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to a more important election in 2012.
Given this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is now run by a "kleptocracy" that continues a series of bribes and protection bribes that are coming their way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely maintain protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They're not just taking money from legitimate businesses, but also from organized crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy -- which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of office" -- will take its toll as money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on the sources whose names have been redacted.
The tape was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we've seen only minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations for many years, and have won several lawsuits for misrepresentation of such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's shit".
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up in the polls.
It is unusual, however, to see such details expressed in this way in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The Moscow city government and its links to criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' confirming that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", says the report.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts have identified a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world".
"Luzhkov is on top of the world".
"The Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and the militia are secondary".
"And finally, at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors".
"It's an inefficient system in which criminal gangs fill vacancies in some areas because the city doesn't provide some services".
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "Moscow business owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Interior Ministry (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so much on the agenda".
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their businesses are shut down under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted he has made little progress.
The embassy report says men are taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow-based Indom research team, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of the political class because in Russia there are no longer political classes".
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by Transparency International (the least corrupt to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm from the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue for a solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN's Larry King, Putin said that the documents WikiLeaks released may have been fakes and reacted angrily to statements that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it's about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in the domestic policy of this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical".
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to face their past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka. " He said, "I love you.
"He was a good leader and took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge regime, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge homeland in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered, long-standing loyalty is also being broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that, for the first time, explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and its former soldiers to children.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly handed down the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng gang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"It's dividing families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993, and large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer looked after them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen back into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge retained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people have had little benefit from surrendering", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were brought up with no idea of doing business".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungles around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"The Mok fed everyone".
"But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the presenter and those responsible for the crimes, but it was not said whether it would proceed with the four cases.
It was not enough to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced laborers.
One steamy evening recently, Im Chaem returned from her field work to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are any more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned of instability if the court sought more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it", he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms means putting together the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other".
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, a 75-page book called "The History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to take hold, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a weed-covered pathway lined with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black ash covered with rusty tin roofs.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many locals come here and pray to him", she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees that it appears its stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed they hit a roadblock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a couple of covert operations were conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That paved the way for a Wednesday agreement to remove the remainder of the material - about 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it's a sensitive matter.
The agreement turned out to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, which eliminated Belarus.
And it was apparently a good move to secure an invitation from the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012".
"This proves that the process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear material around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the George W. Bush administration.
During Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're just using it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and has expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The initial commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was conducted by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on supplying a Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium that is unsuitable for nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Nonproliferation estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium.
According to the Joint Declaration, Belarus will aim to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's announcement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that stronger respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the foundation for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people", he said.
The Spanish government didn't make money off of CIA flights.
The Spanish government has not made any claims about CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in his cable.
This is according to documents provided by the Wikileaks server to El País, which also states that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "showed that it had proper control over foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "takes the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights over its territory.
"They just want to be informed", so as not to be "hit by surprise", Aguirre says in one document.
Also, then-Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to keep the matter as low-key as possible, but with the matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking a judge's initiative to request declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating material or any sensitive information", the embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns more about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than the declassification of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch with the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the Ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit", he had already instructed his associates "to avoid inflammatory comments in order to reduce tensions".
The Ambassador also expressed his concerns about the behaviour of the Partido Popular (PP) political party in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the US government", he notes.
A confessed murderer mother complained online about her maternal "worries"
A young woman spoke about her child after he was dead and had a blog called "Terror in Galicia"
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She used this nickname, which she had used since she was a child, to communicate with her cousin and at least one friend, both from the village of Noia in the province of La Coruña, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know the woman's emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunes in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if the newborn was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon made a new acquaintance.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication indicates that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is kind of angry that I left for work".
"When I told him, he thought it was okay, but now he realizes that he has to be with the baby all day and can't do what he wants".
Then she talks about the text message she just got, "I want you back this month or give me the address to send the baby".
"If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll take it when I get back", she complains.
In May, he spoke of his return to his home: "I'm going this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to work, so I don't lose the job".
He explains that if all goes well, he'll take his son to stay with him.
"He'll be with whoever he wants to be with, which is me, and I'll never leave him with anyone else but my mother again", a dubious intention given her poor relationships.
There's another entry in July.
As you type this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"César is content on one side, but not on the other".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's enjoying it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day".
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to summer school there, so I'll save some money for the nanny".
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll be here".
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what kind of video e-mail, look how he wants, he'll meet me, sex is necessary".
On the 30th, another message: "The boy is doing well, going to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a message about Victor, the current partner: "He gives me money".
There are Monica's posts on anime and manga blogs on the Internet.
She even had her own MySpace, now revamped, where she was called "Muki the ex-con".
"Terror in Galician".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that this is all happening because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center on Menorca.
The defendant's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant had no memory of the incident and "did not intend to harm the child in any way".
But before that, she confessed to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a trunk.
The defense and the prosecution are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would gain 4 seats in the Chamber and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of November 28, the PP could have the main voice in the town halls of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes and experienced MPs during the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has a clear vision of a general election, whether it increases or not, and its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of those compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general elections, compared to 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, is maintained, the party's analysts have calculated that if the general elections are held, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the Chamber from the current 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, the Czech Union) party would also gain 4 seats (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis, the ERC would lose one member of parliament - now it has three - while the ICV would retain one seat, or gain another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next delivery will be in May 2011 during the municipal elections, where the populists could also have a decisive influence on ending the rule of the Socialists in the four provincial capitals and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the Socialists would not get a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona legislature - as it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its share of the vote in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the coup in Tarragona, where they ruled alongside the PP party before the current mayor, José Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP won only 500 votes over the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The populists also won in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and wants to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al-Qaeda with thousands of passports.
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were arrested in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian detained by agents of the Office of the Commissioner for General Information in Barcelona were part of a jihadist cell operated from Thailand that provided passports to various al-Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the latter of which was responsible for the 2008 bombings in Mumbai that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, with the aim of ensuring that the 'Operation Kampai' weakens the international counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaeda and 'thus limits its operational capabilities'.
Investigators estimate that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, it could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization, so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This dismantled cell was not the only one active in Europe, and therefore, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units were involved in the investigations, so it is not excluded that similar operations like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night will not take place in other European countries in the coming days.
In connection with this operation (which saw the arrest of Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another operation took place in Thailand, which captured Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these same men who ran a cell based in Bangkok, Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to be of men aged between 25 and 45, valid for several years, and without visas.
The investigation documents emphasise that no facts are known to link the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai attack, although the perpetrator of the attacks, 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', was allegedly one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination, a remittance agency sent from Catalonia about a thousand dollars, which were "invested" in mobile phone cards that were later used by members of the "komando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands that Mas stops the fiscal deal
The chairwoman of the PPC (Catalan People's Party) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Massa her conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are similar to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and abandon risky ventures such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his term.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party has arrived to meet with Artur Mas with the 18 seats she won in last Sunday's election, a number more than enough to win popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one opposition party to abstain from voting on his election.
The future alliance that the nationalists want to keep in the House until the general elections is based on a possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks that Mas is having these days with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, to win her support for the inauguration, "she will have to end all sovereign and liberationist expressions", as well as an economic agreement - similar to the Basque one - that the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to thin out the overburdened political apparatus of self-government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's appointment will be discussed within the PP party of Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquín Nadal (PSC), who has promised to fight hard, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures us that no deaths occurred because of "lack of precautions"
The Olot Center's performance doesn't rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients.
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday to explain the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Juan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least 11 seniors in his care.
The director of the home, Joan Sala, accompanied by the facility's lawyer, lawyer Joan Canady, announced that "it is the wish of La Caritat to be able to bring charges against the perpetrator" responsible for the killing, but "legitimacy and responsibility obligate us to leave this process to the appropriate authorities".
In addition to the damage to the reputation that the institution may suffer from not detecting the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the major threat to La Caritat is now the demands for material compensation that are already being calculated by the lawyers of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since then.
A judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of the nursing home, suspecting that in many cases no doctor personally examined the dead but, given the patients' age and poor health, the matter was handled by telephone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, firmly rejected this extreme, stressing that "lack of measures could not be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no evidence in the case that any third party other than the defendant himself committed a wrong".
The man now known as "The Angel of Death" admitted to 11 murders yesterday, stating that he committed his first on August 29, 2009, and killed a second elderly woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by overdosing on insulin, unlike the first case, when he used a mixture of tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control staff access to medicines.
In six of the nine cases, the caregiver probably used insulin and a sedative cocktail to kill patients in an attempt to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analysis now underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila is not lying and really sought a less cruel death for his first victims or killed them by administering lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the medical claims, nor does it rule out that the number of dead may be higher than he admitted, and justifies his behavior in various versions that Vila presented to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it was revealed that he had killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the justice system to shed light on the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatened
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to a threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal spreads closed strongly and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, while falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It's gonna take a while for the investor to lose his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to withdraw its liquidity measure today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested that the plan for the State debt buy-back for inefficiency be terminated and that all exceptional liquidity measures be eliminated within the deadline and that unrestricted access be maintained for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast the liquidity level 'at least until March' and to hold a three-month open tender until the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce that they will step up.
If they don't live up to the expectations they've created, they'll recreate the market reaction of yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to draw down liquidity levels, God be with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they said they weren't even considering buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fist announced on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot of them, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's bidding for a one-year exchange in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro has only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
The rates in Portugal therefore fell by 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment that followed Trichet's comments.
In Ireland, figures representing losses for Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated amounts are about $10 billion in short-term securities and another potential $15,000, with a chance of becoming private capital by February, or they'll be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the July stress tests did not reveal the problem, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get a new budget approved by parliament and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains uncertain.
Angela Merkel has toned down her speech to ease tensions ahead of the next EU summit on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the rest would rather play Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - to investors, it sounds like the Four Seasons of Vivaldi.
The Trichet and Zapatero double effect explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4,5%, twice as much as other European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction that will be driven by the Trichet effect, which we hope will create a strong demand that will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a bailout plan would be a sacrifice for Spain.
They'd give us cash we don't need - there's $40 billion in cash in El Tesoro, three times what it was in March - keep rates high and we'd be shut out of the markets sine die.
However, the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not just be it, but dream it" - must continue to be used.
We can do this.
The president of the Eulen Group is challenging the Vega Sicilia deal requested by his children .
The storm of open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not going to stop.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, has challenged, after calling it "completely insignificant", El Enebro's legal action scheduled for the 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, in which they should try to enforce their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia law firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are finalising a legal team for a new chapter in their dispute over control of a part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to settle his dispute over membership of the governing bodies of El Enebro.
Five of its seven descendants, who were appointed chairmen at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year, have been removed from its board of directors and whose objections are registered in the Commercial Register.
The trial of El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of this month, called by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has renewed the thunder in the womb of the Alvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy until the dispute is resolved that guarantees the convening of a committee.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez of Mezquiriz, David Álvarez considers "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial trickery and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which were completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for challenging this action as 'completely irrelevant'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the court to convene a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, the group which owns Bodegas Vega Sicilia among other activities, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the group asks for a 51% share in the company, according to the family protocols.
This is a key issue for the judge to decide when he hears the appeal, a date for which has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered Formula One in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been one of surprise and success.
At first, no one took the newcomer's potential too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the capabilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful walking simulation software that was launched by a German company in 2007 for very long-distance motorsport purposes.
So called PLM, this powerful software tool, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce the product or process faithfully before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software tool allowed the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and tests "in a matter of hours, in near real time".
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables had an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four refinements in a period.
Red Bull's team today has 180 highly skilled young professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyse and design every type of race car modification.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of Red Bull racing cars except the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical prowess is the sum of $40 million, the maximum that each Formula One team can spend each season to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 30 miles outside London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are off limits to visitors, especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great secret".
The project has 580 participants, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is undoubtedly the new Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel.
But behind the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation on the racetrack are other protagonists whose help is invaluable and yet unknown.
Chief Technology Officer Steve Nevey says that five years ago, it was safe to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% of the victory and the rest was drivers' credit.
Today, this ratio has changed, with technology contributing 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 stores within two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in partnership with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP's Spanish Vice-President Helena Herrer gave as an example the newly rebuilt store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for 30 years.
The North American company has a plan to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 in Spain.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), with Barcelona being the third.
Herrer declined to say where the other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the next locations.
Herrer, who also runs HP's HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores would remain the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company is advising on an exclusive design of retail equipment (with products that can be interactively tried out) that will be identical in Europe.
HP is also engaged in the provision of staff for the shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive retail network aims to 'improve customer service, SMEs' purchasing, servicing, after-sales and even packaging services'.
The Barcelona shop is part of a pioneering worldwide pilot programme to address any problems with warranty computer equipment.
The online service is linked to the Technical Centre in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"We can solve problems in 10 minutes that would otherwise take two days".
"This system is especially designed for SMEs and regular customers, since large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service", Helena Herrer stressed yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that he'll "steal" a million clients from his competitors in three years.
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's delegate board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a difficult year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it expects to reduce interest rates, which it will try to compensate by lowering bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 for a period of three years.
The aim is not only to survive without having to seek public assistance in FROB, but also to gain market share by attracting one million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who might leave the bank are taken into account - as the institution has hitherto primarily catered to SMEs and large enterprises rather than small clients.
The Bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 corporate clients this year.
Its market share is 3,5% for retail clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate clients.
The Bank will also be able to provide the Bank with a list of the most important assets and liabilities of the Bank.
Few banking institutions are now daring to set and publish targets, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for global banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, set up four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
The customers who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long one".
Moreover, he added that in two or three years' time, it will be 'very difficult to create jobs', which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of the risk premium that banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, thus offsetting the decline in margins.
'The liquidity and financing issue is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.'
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued orders to his network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking 'is now to reduce commissions' but there is a 'competitive framework'.
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, he assures us that in Spain "bigger sizes will be demanded".
"Next year, there will be no stone left unturned", he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are 'substantially reduced' and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will be included in the red list.
It also points out that FROB can be a substitute for fundraising before new capital is provided.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers are predicting as a new liquidity crisis continues to pose a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of mergers
The CECA's Director-General yesterday rejected the idea of another wave of mergers and insisted once again on the speed of the sector's reorganisation.
When the process of association of Spanish savings banks was launched, several institutions assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a new wave of such operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into Banca Civica cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions".
"Most of it is completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which has cooperated very well in this matter", the director noted.
Speaking at the ADEA (Aragon Executive Association), Olavarrieta said that the merger process was taking place 'at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown by the payments that have appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank in the past, not now'.
"Going from 45 savings banks with an average assets of 28 billion to 17 with assets of 75.5 billion is a process that is unprecedented in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty", he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy views about the slow pace of the process" that show a "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on schedule before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and blamed those who questioned it on a "lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation 'we can be calm' about financial institutions and the savings of the system, which has managed a 'very important' merger process and is proceeding 'at the highest possible pace'.
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red German lines
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but it has set conditions for the whole Union.
The market tensions have provoked a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for SMEs, to the regulation of private intermediation agencies, to the abolition of the €426 for unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management), the managers of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, joined in criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
Let me say in advance that Merkel's position is not a flaw in her communications policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is a collision with the idea of keeping to old traditions that is held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, including Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern countries would leave the euro area.
The second is the return to the brand - although it may now seem like scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to German proposals, a restructuring of the euro with more macroeconomic supervision, budgetary tightening, penalties for guilty states, possible deferral of payments for some of them, and the possible extension of the cost of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for twisting now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what Germany considered to be the right thing to do (fiscal austerity and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The other was shown by this Central European country, as Merkel painfully delayed the decision to rescue Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again made a clear statement when she demanded that the European Union's conventions be reformed to allow a rescue of a Member State and at the same time to oblige private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it hastened the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat moderate form, was approved and we should be following the Union reform process in the coming months, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures are now needed which he seems to disagree with, the old way of working of the euro will be over on that date.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare a moratorium on payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is suggesting that we must take a strict growth path with higher savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on debt and construction, with huge balance of payments gaps, as prevailed during Spain's boom years, they simply will not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would be making a mistake not to understand that.
It is not just a question of restoring the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we could be wrong.
I hope this current turbulence will be replaced by more calm.
And that we will seize the opportunity they're giving us in the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with big business last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that despite criticism of Merkel, the path to the idea of making things right has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And among the options to be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that they warned us.
Sports and circumvention
The finesse that Alonso and Ramos showed in the match against Ajax shows ingenuity, not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged suspension of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) from the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has caused a sea of ink to be written on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether UEFA should eventually punish both players.
It is known that, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the named players, one after the other, deliberately wasted time during the foul-playing period in order to provoke the referee, who showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil their prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing top of their group - and will be able to proceed to the next stage, stripped of their cards.
Eventually, the UEFA disciplinary committee handed coach Jose Mourinho a two-match ban and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar circumstances is not a new practice, but more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos of football, the rules that are not written, but they are followed.
Part of the debate in this case was caused by the fact that the Real Madrid team (which boasts of its nobility and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar acts) was involved, and it seems that the dramatization led by Mourinho adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocateur.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts circumvent the law; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, the meaning of which, however, seems to be being circumvented.
The type of damage such conduct causes to the sporting spirit is being addressed.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical inviolability of the opponents, which in these cases has not been violated, i.e. no violent play has taken place.
Another aspect of fair play is to avoid giving players an advantage over the opposing team by their foul - which is not the case here.
So the paradox of the Real Madrid players' actions is that there was no trick or circumvention, no hidden violation of the rules to avoid a penalty, but rather that the behavior was as obvious as possible in order to get a penalty.
They waited and were happy to be punished.
Another question, though, is what advantage will the guilty have from their willful transgression?
It must be noted that the opponent is not put at a disadvantage and that no advantage is gained in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game, either, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the next match.
However, this is an advantage in the long run and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team may be eliminated, and besides this action will get the players off the penalty and move on to the second round of cards, where one card less is needed to be eliminated than in the first round.
So as the rounds continue, it won't be entirely clear if this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations are not against the spirit of sport, which is to make strategic decisions that allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we're dealing with here, the players didn't aim to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly wit.
I think the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way the instructions were passed from the leadership to provoke them.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as much ethical as it is aesthetic.
The bidding war for the Christmas party in Barcelona
The calendar dictates that this year's avalanche of reservations be concentrated on December 16 and 17.
Employee-sponsored parties are growing rapidly, with people willing to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or the lottery, the arrival of December brings back the Christmas Eve parties, which are still an oxygen bomb for Barcelona's restaurants and leisure facilities, but which have been forced to fight for customers by the crisis by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros per meal, according to businessmen and associations in the sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar concentrated requests this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) for the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for the peak days (16 and 17), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, many companies have cancelled their collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To keep up the tradition, many employees pay for parties out of their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices that are within the limits of what is affordable, says Gaieta Farras, president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona.
A representative of the board of restaurant establishments is not at this time daring to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People think twice before making a reservation".
"They want to get out, but they're cautious about the price", he adds.
Shops will do well for those "who offer quality and good service at a good price", he says, noting that the crisis has led to customers' tendency to go down a notch and that most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various facilities shows that the largest influx of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most demands being for spending under 30 euros, which is accompanied by the menu offered, whose total prices are between 25 and 30 euros.
In addition, the number of early bookings in Andilana, another important company, which has 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar of more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to keep prices from last year, and our menu for everyone to choose from ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
The AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic and QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after recording an increase in profits since the second half of the year and has a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources at the company say December 18 will be a busy day as well, with a Christmas Eve party among friends.
The new menu, which is based on the Christmas menu, has been added to its six group menus, with a budget of €30 or more, as it has seen a 10% increase in the trend of visitors spending compared to last year in exchange for other items such as cava.
They also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees back, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Centre Association) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and says bookings have "revived" although customers are "buying to the max".
This impression has not diminished during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unease that Pakistan's nuclear program is causing in Washington.
In addition to providing illuminating and significant details about the content of the communications and thoughts of the representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is "in decline" rather than increasing, and that the unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not disassembled but are stored in pieces to make them easier to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson calculated in a report before the visit of then-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear material, and the vulnerability of transportation of nuclear material".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the guided missile program is no longer seen only by the United States but also by Russia as a growing and cause for alarm.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; the decline in education and culture has given extremist organizations more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs", said Yuri Korolev, a Russian foreign ministry expert, at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The biggest news document released by Julian Assange's server is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparency often lacks; offers of help remain unanswered or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is building nuclear weapons at a rate no other country in the world has".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "make it very clear" during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani military must end its silent support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the head of WikiLeaks
Obama is appointing a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red notice" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol issued an "emergency call", called a red notice, yesterday to "locate and track the movement" of Assange.
But this is not a classic warrant for your arrest.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leak of over a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens' lawyer assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was November 20th when the International Police Corps based in Lyon, France issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries have Interpol's instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to temporarily detain and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person who is the subject of a red notice, many Member States, the organisation explained, regard red notices as allowing for the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police - especially where States have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is presumably to be held.
This move was scandalized by Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter claiming that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who they compare to the legendary Lavrentii Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter states.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother in Australia is defending her son's innocence - Assange remains in the dark, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave a Skype interview from an unknown location to the editor of Time magazine, in which he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If she turns out to be responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage at the UN in violation of international conventions to which the US is a signatory, she should step down", he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called his demand for his resignation "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior official in charge of counterterrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop giving Assange more prominence contrasts with the views being proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider listing WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization "so that anyone who provides financial or other assistance can be targeted and prosecuted".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, declaring that Assange should "be killed", which he had to withdraw.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use a drone or something".
The one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak of information, has committed treason and any punishment other than death would be too lenient", he told Fox News.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "winking" at Caroda's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuance.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the several internal revolts within the ERC (Catalan Left Republican Party) that have failed to produce results due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader José Luis Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as his leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot make him worry as he did about other extinct currents.
That's why the leader of the Left will try to win new criticism by winking his eye to help him turn to the general election.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be allowed to speak in secret to keep him in office.
With ballots, not a raised hand.
If Carrod's supporters want to hand over the chairman's criminal vote, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
The boss really wants to avoid division and submission of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his position available - a gesture they consider of no consequence, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ at the conventions.
But since they don't have enough votes to force his resignation, they'll try to remind the executive of the plan between now and May.
To this end, they expect to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be put to a vote by the management at the National Council on the 18th of each month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercosa in exchange for his promise to move the congress to the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multi-voice" is detrimental to stability and that his goal is to make the organisation able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, the article signed by current advisor Josep Huguet on his blog seems to be a sign.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideology, this innovation advisor took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for a few goals".
And he named five, two of which were excellent.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces who are from the sector that is pro-Caroda.
Target two could be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely abandon the mechanism of meetings.
And so he fights for a reform of the charter so that congresses can be held by delegates elected by popular vote.
The end of the model of the assembly system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, which has been fighting in this direction for the last two congresses.
However, the convulsive 2008 assembly decided that the meeting must be judged at a special congress on statute reform.
The matter is still pending as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors waiting, it might be a good time to re-engage with this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico has seen a four-fold decrease in cases since 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, reports the daily MILENIO.
The murders stand out in the three women's cases and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, a body was found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, plus a blunt force trauma to the head, and had his hands and feet tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that had been stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the Naucalpan district.
Early Thursday morning, November 4, the cooperatives discovered a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshot wounds to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero section.
Next to the body was a note signed by what is believed to be the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after he left his home to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims aged 30 were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a body was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, a man shot in the forehead, and a .25 caliber bullet was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage drain in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue crews searched extensively for other parts of the body, but they found none.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported finding a body with his hands tied behind his back and his head wrapped around the Pena Colorado site.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported, who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of a car in Villas de la Hacienda, Atizapán de Zaragoza, with death threats on the victims' faces.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes County, La Paz.
The remains of a body were found in a nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead wrapped in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan, in the county of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, a man was found dead in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, who was identified as Mario Ríos, according to the report left by the murderers.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla community with no signs of life with two gunshot wounds to the back.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") was found on the woman's skin, as well as necklaces bearing her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found in his car in the village of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, with their heads wrapped in tape and a note, were found in the Puente de Piedra neighborhood of Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim was reportedly a member of a criminal organization, and the message read: "This is what happens to those who do not adapt".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found with torture marks and bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the San Agustin Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes, La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl counties.
The first was cut and found in the Colony of Cuchilla Ancón, wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape and leaving a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China keeps its greenhouse gas reduction target
The country's representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and he stressed that he was sticking to his pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public speech to the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in the past four years to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China would not change its objectives and would continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He said that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said progress had already been made on all these points, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese authorities have not yet been able to verify the verification of the verified data.
The Commission also found that the Chinese exporting producers were not able to provide the information requested by the GOC.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project, the replacement of incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient ones and the mitigation and adaptation project are also underway, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's climate change expert, assured that China's efforts were greater than is generally thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are 6 tons, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of historical emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Espin's legal disqualification is Caesar Nava.
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional) party stated that the former chairman of the party is entitled to claim his rights from the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal and that the former president of the party was entitled to appeal to the National Order Commission and claim his right.
In an interview that was conducted before the objection was raised by the state governor Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the expulsion of Espino was in any case a decision made at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonoran Order Commission".
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal his case to the National Council's Disciplinary Committee, because it is a decision made by a competent authority", he added.
He also explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that he has never been at the negotiating table for the presidency of the Alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This [the 2012 alliance] is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was a local election plan that was successful and served its purpose", he noted.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue had been behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, but on the contrary we benefit from it and it strengthens us", he added.
He said the committee could choose the best chairman or chairwoman the PAN deserved for the next three years without debate, so he would hand the relay to "whoever the committee designates".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's rise in the last election in July would be reflected in future clans, although "there is no time to think about 2012 yet".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué on this mission".
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe, would represent the flag and be the object of observation throughout the country, as 'there are many expectations and aspirations placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to these expectations'.
When asked about President Felipe Calderón's criticism of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) for his speeches during his four years in power, César Nava urged PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedilla and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Claderon governments, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shells", he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to speak as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a bill on Twitter to help undocumented students
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", the US president tweeted on a popular social networking site.
President Barack Obama today posted on his personal Twitter account to join a national rally in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students.
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", Obama tweeted.
His brief message points to an online link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on the bill approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to voice your opinion", he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block passage of any legislation unless it approved an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could influence votes on the Dream Act and other bills, such as ratification of a new nonproliferation treaty with Russia called START.
When asked about the Republican block on the Dream Act and other bills, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there is still time... "
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year"...
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we can plan the order of the other matters", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will call for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so the bill to legalize undocumented students could be put to a vote in the Senate starting next Thursday, though it's more likely next week.
Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize the approximately 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have been in the country for the past five years, and have been accepted into a higher education institution or military service.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of a few Republicans, so his advocacy organizations are campaigning hard to get the bill passed.
The Democrats, who are overwhelmingly in favor of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed support for the bill.
That's why Dream Act supporters need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators most negotiated with by supporters are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who filled the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the motion, John McCain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is similar to the Czech "to hit a nail on the head - note. translated)
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand Sex in Language, but... Finger in the wound? What do you expect from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to launch the second round of the Pleasure of Language series, a series that celebrates literature written in Spanish and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another fair, the topic of Sex in Language was discussed at a round table, she explained).
"It puts us in a tight spot", the Argentine writer said graciously to an audience of mostly young people who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and featuring Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montera and Luise García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text she had dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa played the protagonist in the first person, who, in search of knowledge of what a "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, without getting an answer, although traces of the same story do.
She leaves the infectious disease clinic convinced, "patience is not my strong suit, maybe it's my wound".
Finally, after a frustration with the trauma specialist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained that wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents what is really open and the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief, concluding that "all she had learned about the wound was that it was really open and that it did not exist", but she became convinced that pleasure and language pitfalls must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
Also, the Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez came up with a lovely story he called The Glory of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at some point it appears.
with elements of magical realism, it tells the story of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or restored the integrity lost by a virgin, a tale that then turned to speak America, a great novel that from the beginning was not without its own chroniclers who told it, and here is a quote from Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration of the stories of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, scoffed at the faked testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but no other way has ever succeeded in telling the story of America with such imagery that lacked even shame".
However, he stressed, "it is fools and liars who have more imagination", and it is precisely where reality and falsehood merge, where it is no longer known which of the stories belongs to one group and which to another, that fiction literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the Cervant tradition.
"It is his legacy that gives us what we have".
Mayra Monter then highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations made possible by the invitation to the International Book Fair with her speech Finger in the Throat.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed her finger at the great wound of social violence that runs through her country - and Latin America shares it - as a result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs make a quiet compromise that is obviously not intended", she said after stating that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that is in a hurry, with its intellectual habits and mind controls that are overwhelmed with dogmatism, people forget that "behind every nod is a small no and behind every denial is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and to bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without color, and also to bother the authorities who prefer this black and white world", he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he's had his ups and downs in his career, but he's already scored on three occasions in the deciding series.
In the final, Santos Laguna and Monterrey will face two different styles with different techniques, teams with different results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the final, he's had his ups and downs in his career, but he's scored in the deciding series three times already, but he's been out of the game so far, and that's why this opportunity is special.
The Argentine had to settle for silver, staying one step behind the winner and curiously playing the same team in the next final.
Santisti's strategic as a coach reached his first final in the Apertura 2002, when he was in the hands of Morelia, with whom he lost 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament, he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, again against the "Diablos" of Toluka, Rubén suffered another defeat, although his team played against the "Usenarios" (also nicknamed Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of play tied 2-2, after a series of penalties he got into a three-to-one advantage and had two chances to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed 11 steps and the team suffered a turnover of 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals to the Red Devils of Toluka and one to Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and thus celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important institution is the institution.
"I want to come out a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I have, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first thing is the most important", the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
He has a vivid memory of the previous final, in which, he says, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee scores the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, and so do the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned the lesson in this one, until the game is over, we can't celebrate".
He is not worried that this series could decide in the penalty shootout, he trusts his players: "You never try to get to a series of penalties, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready, but unfortunately fate has prepared us a bad move, maybe because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully something like that will not happen this time".
Romano has a chance to stop being the second best and taste the glory that titles bring for the first time.
The United States is changing its visa rules
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centre before the interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be shorter.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing process at U.S. Embassies and Consulates will change.
The new procedure will require most applicants to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centre (ASC) before the interview at the Consular Section.
ASC personnel will collect the applicant's biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of visa processing will be lower, no more fees for arranging an appointment, one for processing an application and another for the delivery of a document by a transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for business and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visas will not have to go through an interview with a consular officer, but simply go to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Since biometrics will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second interview at the Consular Section will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey, and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay an extra $26 service fee.
The visa application procedure for the United States of America is currently being implemented in the United States.
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could be a breakthrough in the search for alien life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When invited to speak, NASA assured reporters that it would make "a breakthrough discovery in the search for extraterrestrial life", which has sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that there are other creatures besides us living in inhospitable conditions that were once considered uninhabitable, and that they might one day become intelligent creatures like humans if their conditions are improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic to sustain life, and it's this ability that makes it more likely that life like this could exist on other planets that don't have an atmosphere like Earth's.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will prove that "there is another, different form of life than the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true impact of the findings at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will feature geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) with the prospect of its chemical composition being similar to Earth's.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón are giving birth to an opposition "bloc"
Constitutional reforms in the Congressional Bill of Rights are leading to the advent of "bipartisanship", they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term had not even begun when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Consensus) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing: bringing "bipartism" to the Chamber.
Before the start of the session to open the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "rhyme" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, because it eliminates them.
This reform, they repeated, would begin "bapartism", because now two people from the same number of parties would control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit from the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms constitute institutionally a political marginal at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and PAN.
He said that in the coming days he would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they do not have it, they will be subjected to these two parties again, ending the opposition coalition.
"When they [the opposition coalition] get here, I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that they were in agreement with the PRD, PT and Patrón and would therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, once monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
The goal of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, added Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at present the Congress has become the "spoil" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by one party, now it's divided between two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the member's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the table.
"To ensure that we five MEPs, who are probably nine now, but who now see us as five, are not left out because of the agreements, each in a different group, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we are out of the picture and we do not agree with this reform".
Another 200,000 pesos is being issued to the "supplier"
The city of Mazatlan is paying another check to the owner of the electrical supply company.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid to the owner of the electrical supply company in the second half of the year to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the city's transparency page, this latest check, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of this year, was for 200,144.56 pesos and stated as the subject of "settlement of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay an additional amount to this supplier, which has been monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for selling at high prices.
What's not said is the total amount the city still owes her and how many more checks will be sent to Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought now, just what we owe her, like other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques 'reappeared' in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last on 16 November.
Although the businessman has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law for companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services being used by other administrative bodies, the Treasurer has assured that he has not used the services of the City Hall's contractor again.
In the past, after July 25, the daily Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the city hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachó Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also executed transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist Sites Needed Maintenance
Tour operators are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Sanchez Taboada's bus in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist fell into the deep end of the Sanchez Taboada pier, the tourism sector in Mazatlan is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, so as not to make the port look good.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Business Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to pay attention to the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk through and see the disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the revenue they're running out of, or they wouldn't have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner Jose Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The councillor will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, she will have to do preventive maintenance, not just fix existing faults", he said.
We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because we as residents deserve clean housing, the city council should change its strategy for maintaining the city".
There are other sites that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito.
"Nowadays, to attract tourists, it is not just about promotion, it is about offering a good product, a city that is clean with its beaches and streets, where the tourist attractions are maintained", he said.
"There has been a lack of attention and these facts highlight something that is well known, maintenance is lacking.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be cleaned up in cooperation with the city council, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and tidy to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúlera Llínez, undersecretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not being used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and spaces, but we will first need to clean up the area to make them attractive and to include them in the list we have for the promotion of this destination".
IP is asking Congress for results.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like the members to take on a great responsibility by leading by example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the country.
A parliamentary term full of decent work and no agreements between the parties and the state executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is in convulsions and faces great problems.
Yesterday marks the start of the 60th parliamentary term, comprising seven political forces, 19 PRI, 13 PAN, three Partido Nueva Alianza, two PRD, one PT, one Convergencia and the last PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations for new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and to various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that they will not repeat the same partisan and paternalistic patterns.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Business Coordination Council (CCE), suggested that the 40 recently elected members of Congress take on a great responsibility and set an example on the way to better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between parties, because they usually make arrangements to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and parliamentary faction leaders".
He therefore spoke of the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary intersections to move the ruling class forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and above all be committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to join forces in an effort to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
Most importantly, they stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which in a way will support job creation.'
As regards tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it more weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the second-lowest budgeted ministry, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currency and investment, which in addition directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to providing funding for tourism startup projects, Congress should help bring the state into the fold and help with the alcohol bill that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
The Three Kings are wanted
Dolls, cars, and bicycles are among the toys on the wish list for the children in the Coronado Valenzuelas family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their expectations for the upcoming Festival of the Three Kings, since their household is exactly 12 people and one lamb.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Caspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende, in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'whites' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, a mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he has wanted a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetano would like clothes the size of a year's worth.
"He (José Alfredo) said to me 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I said 'we'll see my son' because it was very expensive", recalls Cayetano.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, wears a size 12, Isaías, 10, and Miguel, 8, wear a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old Jose Juan is missing a pair of sneakers, so he could really use a pair of a size five and a half or six.
To help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuelos come true, you can join the Three Kings in Search campaign and bring a gift or cash to the reception of the Noroeste daily.
14 alleged drug dealers who were arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday as part of the liquidation of a network for the production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in areas used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a police spokesman in Quebec.
Eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom are believed to be the heads of this entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were required to report to the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections followed a lengthy investigation which lasted for almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 officers from the Regional Investigation Department of the City of Estrie, the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships being loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand squarely on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet", said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by lawmakers after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow for the detention of up to one year of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was going to the wrong end.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", Duceppe said.
NPD critic Olivia Chow on the immigration issue has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we see as the underlying part of another bill, C-35", Ms. Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it puts the blame on refugees and imprisons children for at least a year", Ms. Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
"Canadians are collectively telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it like some kind of pathogen".
They expect Canada to take strong action, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not called a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead to a vote of no confidence.
A conservative told QMI that the government will call a vote to hold any MP who is against it accountable to their constituents.
New Unity Does Not Mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, is trying to make sure that this idea is not forgotten: Quebec plans to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on the issue as early as January next year.
The Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement took some of us by surprise.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council of Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
It took little for the public safety critic, PQ member Stéphane Bergeron, to describe the announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and "an amateur solution jammed on its knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future of unity.
"They'll be satisfied with confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it".
"We are aware of the problem".
For CSQ president, Réjan Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness interrogation in a public hearing.
"Furthermore, Mr. Charest is making a point of not wanting to form this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I do, that he's hiding something", he explains.
"The only way to get a commission of inquiry is to have Jean Charest resign", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Training of Senior Civil Servants.
To get out of this dead end, he proposed that Quebec grant a special mandate to the inspector general to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General", he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government files.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to make it more appropriate for this type of crime.
This request is allegedly based on the Operation Marteau (The Hammer) Envoy,who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some amendments to the file.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected biker groups, despite the fact that the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed amendments to the Gangster Act.
The rivers are under strict surveillance.
Several waterways have come under tight control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
There was another landslide in the evening in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's bumpy.
Several regions were hit by heavy rainfall from Tuesday to Wednesday night, with between 40 and 70 millimeters (10.5 to 17.5 inches) falling.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The northern stretches of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the hardest hit.
It could drop as much as 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitations to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be concerned about flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec emergency services issued a flood warning Wednesday night for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood warnings and continuous monitoring.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall caused the drainage of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains caused the collapse of a temporary bridge.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of some roads, notably in the commune of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency services are on alert and monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a flash flood warning for several rivers on Wednesday, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio-television Broadcasting Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for rude language during the broadcast.
The Broadcasting Board of Canada considers that Mr. Dupont and his group at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their views, but some statements included "incorrect information on welfare and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians, gross language that does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of both persons who took their own lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council has received several complaints concerning comments made during broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint from the Quebec Social Beneficiaries' Joint Front.
The group complained that the amounts reported in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The presenters must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, host Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the message conveyed was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the DuPont Noon News have touched on a sensitive topic in an impartial and appropriate manner".
No reprimand was issued against him.
The latest controversy involved a statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were involved in a media shootout that drew a lot of attention.
The CHOI host said he didn't send any donations to help Haitians because we can't know for sure that those in need will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of Haitians.
"I've already paid off my three-day delay in the matter".
"My file has been untouched for a year and a half", said the moderator.
In all its decisions, the Commission refuses to use broadcast language.
In any event, CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond its responsibilities'.
For a station which will have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, among other things, the consequences are minimal.
The king of kung fu in Montreal.
A Montreal resident, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely peculiar temperament.
An athlete who excels in sand (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing, and Thai boxing enters tatami courts and rings around the world, seeking new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", explains Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I look for matches pretty much everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game that comes with martial arts, competitions in North America are rare".
Recently, this man who works as a security guard and as a UPS assistant just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he said.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the San Sho World Cup".
"Invited were the top four finishers in the last World Championship in each category".
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third", he added.
"The interesting thing is that in every competition I have made some progress".
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or next!"
San shou or Sanda is a discipline originating in China where punching and kicking are allowed, as well as throwing on the ground.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this form of fighting is Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one career save, he boldly confirms his participation in the King of Sand Super Tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This is the highest and most prestigious competition in China", explains the nice guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The man who beat me was a real professional, analyst".
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The semi-final winners will face off in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will battle it out to crown the one champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million contracted without tendering
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any information on the amount of aid granted to the project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project totalling $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, Énergie gérance, was mandated in 2004 to entrust the management of this major hydroelectric project worth USD 5 billion to the private sector, in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium won a lucrative contract without any call for tenders.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against the consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition".
"This means that people no longer make side deals in secret, they now do them openly", PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard asked the National Assembly this question because he says he has a hard time understanding how the public interest can be sold this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, vehemently denying that this contract was a collision.
"I have my own way", she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked precision".
She said it would be the least of her problems to have PQ apologize.
The recipe for a consortium is common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more undertakings to pool their expertise to respond to a call for proposals for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scope of work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition being able to negotiate; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer the exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula for engineering consulting is the subject of a government investigation.
A quick glance at the business register of Quebec firms reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be established permanently.
Dessau thus operates in partnership with most of its main competitors, namely CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that 'the Baie James area is characterised by a particular labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s'.
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), has given an explanation that makes us shake our heads at the fact that the contract to manage the project was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public tender and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher".
"You have two choices: you take the people who are on the contract as contestants and you say, 'Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and good price.'
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that counts, but the competence of the people", Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 awarded to the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded to Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratories performing soil analysis.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, of which Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in Énergie Gérance.
All the contracts were done.
In total, they're worth $449,783,344, including a contract with the energy company, $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are 'very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec'.
Minister Normandeau leaked a report that PQ was also linked to companies that "fund" it, before clarifying that they were rather its managers.
Responsible consumption barometer - the 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in 'impartial' labels and environmental certifications to guide his product choices.
Worst of all, even as we bathe in a media universe that urges and encourages us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe is lamenting the lack of credible information, the failure to meet its obligations, which it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, says the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first article was published yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still have little confidence in them
Two-thirds of us actually say they don't trust companies' environmental promises, simply because green advertising by companies detects a measuring instrument developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates for so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that claim to be environmentally responsible, says Barometer.
Similarly, the debate of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be the first priority for stimulating this aspect of consumption, which is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second setback the Barometer has identified, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the information provided about the products or "green" services we are looking to get our hands on.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products in response to their beliefs.
As many as 61% preferred to shop at local retailers and preferred to buy food grown in their region, reports Barometre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to minimize its environmental impact by taking care of the animals.
But their social and environmental consciousness has apparently remained outside their car, says Barometer: In 2010, only 28 percent of Quebecers said they use public transportation or recommend using a car for at least two people to protect nature.
Walking and cycling also promoted this cliché in 39.1% of the participants in this large survey.
The State loan to purchase the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have asked to participate financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company 'Angus et le Parallèle', which sought a grant of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of cinematic art, did not get what it wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would be of a lower amount than was originally expected, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources from the State.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised down.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister for Culture by François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprise (SODEC), who manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the State must really be rejected.
It should be recalled that the Quebec Cinema Owners and Cinematheque Centre Association opposed direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a property project if he has not done so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion instead demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, brought the art of cinema to his theatres within a decade after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for the amendment by the state board of finance.
The shortage of independent movie theaters is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to free up funds for the private sector, in the hope of securing $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
As of spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The future buyers aim to reopen all three theatres on February 27th next year to screen the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, and he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are made to him.
The curtain is raised on Canada as a whole...
New US diplomatic sources leaked through WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as an inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but in the same blow reveal its sense of the latter's superiority to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canada-US relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including those from the U.S. embassies in Ottawa and Washington, D.C., leaked yesterday, provide additional sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets being discussed by political leaders.
Much to the surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"Canada's almost entrenched inferiority complex is making it possible for political leaders to talk about internal stakes instead of realizing that these elections involve the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
"The United States is, therefore", he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls".
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in a message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in a confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, in which Canada will publicly acknowledge its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan", writes Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone the Christmas Eve session of parliament to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties depend on the quality of the proposed reconstruction plan for their survival.
Another report from January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws attention to Washington's increasingly negative image of the United States from dramatic series on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, which contain not-so-intelligent references to Maher Arar, the No-Fly-List, or abductions for the purpose of forced interrogation by the CIA.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was prepared to accept some Guantanamo detainees.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some papers concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State".
"Secretary has accepted to review the file".
And finally, the people who WikiLeaks is about are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
It went viral and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
A Worldwide Plan to Restore Light
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun a plan to restore home, business and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reductions needed to stabilize the planet's climate between now and 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the large-scale concrete projects that the UN wants to promote in Cancun to compensate for the lack of hard-to-implement reduction commitments by industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the hot bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70 percent of the market, are replaced by fluorescent light bulbs, or better yet, LEDs, a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons of GHG emissions on the planet from lighting would be decomposed.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the entire car fleet on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GHG emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we need to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5% is the product of light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, we reduce energy consumption by 75%, and with the new LED light bulbs, we reduce energy consumption by half.
Fluorescent light bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, introduced this week by Philips - which was reportedly involved in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a light bulb, giving us an idea of the potential savings with a replacement plan that would be implemented in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection centres.
However, the report notes, the planet's main source of mercury emissions is not a fluorescent bulb but rather coal-fired power plants, which release much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would derive from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that cost 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate release of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast after the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay", the spokesman for the UN president stressed.
"It calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the Election Commission delayed the deadline - midnight Wednesday - without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round between outgoing President Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara multiplied around the world.
But Gbagbo's camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul the "fraudulent" vote in the north, which has been ruled by former New Army (N.A.) rebels since a failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivory Coast presidential campaign manager, confirmed that the FN (New Army) intimidation manoeuvres in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the Ivory Coast president from voting.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any links to former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them but not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the Electoral Commission from broadcasting the results.
Sunday's second round of presidential elections was seen as the crowning achievement of the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country that has been divided for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote, against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, in the literal sense, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas regions), according to provisional seasonal adjusted figures (SAC) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The unemployment rate has stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed for 9,3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9,7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 percentage points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market has been further exacerbated by a further increase in the unemployment rate, which has reached 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, the International Labour Office reported that 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were literally out of work.
As regards the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), i.e. 482 000 people aged 50 and over and 6.6% including overseas regions.
Only the population aged 25-49 years benefited from the stability of unemployment at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee has not published its monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, however, continues to compile monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste treatment company and brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône district council, was charged and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public contracts allegedly obtained by subterfuge.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, bribery, accepting bribes to influence the authorities and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists that the judge be clear about all the questions he wants to ask him, and not some delusions".
"It is easy to prosecute him for many criminal charges, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent the judge a brief statement before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his close associates, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but keep the landfill he was supposed to run running.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of the funds involved in their operation, Mr Simon said he had never known anything of the kind.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of services for the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, leaving the protagonists of the whole affair free, under judicial supervision and a restraining order.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that are being brought against him".
"The investigating judge will take note and release him", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, Deputy State Attorney Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, the elegant deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the authorities and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "misappropriation and misuse of company property", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealment of misuse of company assets".
Among those confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped launder money from a large-scale gangster ring.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the field of waste.
From a close investigation source, the investigation focuses in particular on the allocation and operation conditions of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from some towns in the commune of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee Palace has overstated mediation for Syria
Over a period of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", unified opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert and highlighted the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is being closely watched by US diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how senior French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by US justice for smuggling material to benefit Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they bring to sharp light the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilda Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything about it.
Diplomatic cable dated 12 August 2009 in Paris, titled: 'Iran: French comments on the way to deal with the hostage situation'.
The Elysee Palace's adviser on strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with US diplomat Allegrone.
They're teaching him the French method.
They're recommending that Americans do just as much to get their own nationals forcibly returned to their homelands.
"Make noise", they say, "keep saying" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
We need to put the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, in a difficult position.
"Do it more, the more they ask you to stop".
Since attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purpose of 'political blackmail'.
It announces that the release of Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French Embassy grants her asylum) "will require the payment of a large financial sum to the Iranians" (a bail of 230 000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians "could arrest another 1,800 or so French people living in Iran in the future", he says.
The Commission shall take a decision by means of implementing acts.
Klotilda Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she's still locked up in Iran.
Word is out: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States says was deported for illegally trafficking sensitive electronic material into Iran, is released in Paris on a judge's order.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to acquire material destined for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed to negotiate?
Freeing an Iranian for freeing a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysian Palace, he says, was not only "shocked by the judge's decision" but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the minister of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysee Palace adviser dials the phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings run by the Iranian embassy".
During the imprisonment of Clotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through a communiqué and organised 'leaks' to the media, to persuade that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing a 'significant' and 'influential' role as 'mediator'.
The Americans are not without irony in their observation of this activity and say that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media 'brilliance' of French officials".
What is the basis for such a level of "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their boastful statements, French officials privately admit they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The documentary then explores the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to prevail in this fiction.
The intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of openness with Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the role of Syria", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway".
"This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among Iranians".
Clotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our homeland".
No more midnight online games for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival" that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to games after midnight for those under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead normal lives during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the senior official in the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the law's implementation, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also make available free software to limit time spent on the Internet to people who request it.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly reports on various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world in online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: FIFA establishes the host countries.
Amid a riot over allegations of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday set the host country for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to be a politically motivated selection where the battle for influence and lobbying risks overtaking technical criteria.
The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the sport (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to either conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its debut on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be staged in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will be participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of the economic and political stakes around the world.
The backstage negotiations run the risk of dragging on until the last minute.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a candidate hierarchy.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties on the measures in question.
But those reasons won't carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the vote.
The Sunday Times at the start of the revelation leading to the suspension of two members of the European Commission for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have thus ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of a kicked-out country that has so far hosted the World Cup only once a year.
The BBC put the finishing touches on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinched the needle" on three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and get the English chief executive in trouble with David Cameron first.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new glow to its name at the EC?
Nothing less is certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in the triumphs of the stadiums already built, their good fortune (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could put those ambitions to shame.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in words that barely twisted the English press's accusations against the members of the EC.
"We will throw mud at them, try to compromise them", Mr Putin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite, with its considerable experience from 1994.
The world's highest performing economy, home to FIFA's main sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have come up with a beautiful project.
But these nominations seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which is a FIFA heavy favorite, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out the big ace in futuristic stadiums and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could be paying for the fading TV fees (due to time shifts) paid by European countries, which are a driving force for FIFA.
Second term: certainty
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand has given the impression that he is hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they.
The mandate to the Elysee Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious doesn't exactly match the secrecy that comes with the presidency.
So we have to act as if the doubts are constant.
In both senses.
In 2006, to the dismay of many, the friends of Jacques Chirac were demanding that a third term be not ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would "make a decision sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded the UMP parliamentarians on Wednesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown little fever.
Was that an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far off.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was a statement from him, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's made a humorous reminder of the presidential election at these meetings.
"At best or worst, you have seven and a half years with me", he said in July 2009.
May 2010 Rebellion: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage".
His remarks the day before yesterday do not make him a candidate any more than the day before yesterday; they do not make him a candidate any less.
If they're causing any comment, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to the sack of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want the formation of the fighting forces premature rather than intended.
Bad survey on the other side.
First, the voters of the right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this with the UMP", the immediate and cautious response came from the prime minister's inner circle.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the recovery from the crisis or, at least, to announce the termination of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is binding, and the SEC will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a worsening of the already tense situation on European securities markets.
The political price would be even higher.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in helping to resolve the debt crisis of European countries.
She didn't say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
'I reserve my reasoning for my European partners (...) '.
The European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, in his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels the night before, was no more eloquent about his intentions, content to say that the secondary market government bond purchase programme was 'going ahead' and that 'we will see what we decide' at its meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its key fixed interest rate at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the European Central Bank's treasury bond purchases have doubled in the last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the parties to the advance purchase agreement that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists are not expecting any major change in the exchange rate either.
If the operations of lending for more than three months have already disappeared from the European Central Bank's arsenal, the latter shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule in any significant way".
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of creating new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
'The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,' predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds to his plan for intervention in the sovereign debt market that 'the ECB would have to maintain its bond purchases to revive a sluggish market'.
Given the exposure of European banks to the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, they have no choice but to maintain their market presence.
"It needs to make up for the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and act in a way that prevents the bursting of paid performance by the countries that are among the most fragile", a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, countries will be more concerned about reducing their debt than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back on the
After a start to a week of worrying Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with a reversal in 10-year bond yields.
Return to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as 'irreconcilable' and that he expected an 'unpredictable' weekend, which the participants then denied.
In any case, the deviation from German long rates reached a record 210 basis points on Tuesday and the price of CDSs soared to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "the turbulent market developments" and the possible Irish-origin disease.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unambiguously, its problem is the absence of growth and the lack of significant fiscal input, which go hand in hand and put the state at risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new package of amendments to the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, worth 7 billion euros.
'If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken,' said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been saying this for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors under pressure from Italy on the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than that required of other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections he expects to be held at the end of March could begin.
This would open a period of time which is not very suitable for decision-making in a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening their anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated that all day and all night on Sunday, they are clearly very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency area".
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion in interest rates on European government bonds brought a windfall to governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target on which most speculation is focused.
'Because in May the real policy is not transparent and obvious enough, mainly in the banking system,' says Exane BNP Paribas economist.
More so, "political time runs slower than market time".
Aware of this disconnect and the danger it presents, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the crisis mechanisms already in place.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, who are most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings starting early next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
The programme is concerned with the unconventional market-oriented support measures for euro area countries (see above).
As for the European Financial Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, took a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about the developments in Europe.
If the objective of this journey is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way for that.
The first issue of EFSF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in the funds mobilized by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries in question, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are accompanied by strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are keen to avoid seeking international assistance at all costs before they have implemented their own budgetary adjustments and decided on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
The European funds' equity participants are finally talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-engage in the stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the player in the first ever European sovereign debt deal, believe that an additional €100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is subsidised to date by EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being tried in European capitals.
Especially with the market conditions getting worse.
Snow and avalanches: 24 counties are on orange alert.
The snowfall continues to cause difficulties for transport, especially on secondary roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert for snow and avalanche.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined 20 districts that have already declared an orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is causing problems in the north of Gironde and the Charentes and slight snowfall in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, with places of 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover of 1 to 3 cm, with places of up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, forecasts Météo France.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts have banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tonnes on the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Traffic on secondary roads in Brittany is very difficult, police say, and they recommend driving only if absolutely necessary, and some trucks have been cancelled for the day.
In Picardy, school parties are forbidden on Thursdays.
No special measures are foreseen to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office "urges all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the nature of the road".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their airline.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been pouring down.
At least during the discussion.
We would like to mention in particular the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this construction to start, the State announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount which would then allow SGP to use part of its dual source of funding for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the First Amendment.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which is being considered by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains mechanisms designed to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
First, as we read in the text of the bill, Article 15 reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: 'The yield on this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the restructuring of the existing office fee 'to modernise it, to increase the revenue generated by it and to benefit Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that be?
It's a vision.
It's not listed in the text.
We're a long way from 4 billion.
'It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of capital support to be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris under the project', reads the explanatory memorandum.
For us at SGP, this system is not shocking.
"Once we generate revenue, we can cover the study for three years and then dig up $4 billion", it explains.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed".
SGP estimates that EUR 4 billion will be committed only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion belong to subscribers who are not yet present, risks provoking a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on December 7th.
Vengeful hackers and disruptive spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, there is a flagrant scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future of controlled regression.
But let's go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the fact that every document compiled by any intelligence agency, any nation, is made up entirely of press cuts.
The Americans' "extraordinary revelations" about Berlusconi's sex life are announcements that have been read for months in any newspaper (all but the two Berlusconi owns), and the disgustingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of cabaret sketches.
The rule that secret documents must consist only of information already known is fundamental to the dynamics of intelligence, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore that specializes in esoteric literature, you will find that each work (on the Grail, the Rennes-le-Château mystery, the Templars or the Masons) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts is reluctant to seek out new information (or know where to look for reports of nonexistent information) but because those who practice the occult only believe what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or short-tempered) head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération) who only believes what he admits to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek published a week earlier.
So why the fuss about these documents being revealed?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, which is that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can phone or fly off to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the national team, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows perfectly well that hypocrisy is the only way to seemingly ignore it.
However, the fact that it is being repeated in public dishonors the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could gain access to the most highly classified information in the most powerful country in the world is a blow, not a minor one, to the prestige of this government department.
Scandal affects both victims and perpetrators.
But let's move on from that to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to seize all power, like some Big Brother, controlling every move of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway used, and so on, has made the citizen a total victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as we're doing now, that even the "tombs" of the most secret information of the powerful can't resist a hacker's attack, the control message stops being one-way and becomes circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power sustain itself if it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel said that the real secret is the empty secret (and the empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a secret empty secret because it is pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was empty secrets is to strip him of all power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big with Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the power so great?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - it would be like putting it on a street corner poster.
But it is also quite clear that with current technology, it is useless to hope that a telephone message can be kept secret.
There's nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state has been on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive information be kept secret in the future ?
I know that my forecast for the moment is science fiction and therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials discreetly carrying out formalities on uncontrollable routes, carrying only the reports they know by heart or rather hiding precious information in the heel of their shoes.
The information will be kept in unique copies in keyed drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, which means backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, the Internet has rehabilitated the wire-based telegraph.
Video cassettes (analogue) allowed film lovers to shoot a film step by step, moving it back and forth and revealing all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow you to jump through chapters, i.e. through macropores.
By express train, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas the flight and the transportation involved take three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, then, for politics and communications to return to horse-drawn carriages.
One last thing.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was going on inside the embassy.
Now it's the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (called fast start or early finance) made by developed countries.
And the great French hack was exposed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or €420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU took a big step to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, a distribution of brochures...
Transparency operation invaluable and valued for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to treat them equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has committed €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its €7.2 billion pledge in 2012.
But if you look at the detail, you see that things are much more complicated.
These funds are 'new and additional' under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is realised without prejudice to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, took 2009 as the reference year: international funding was maintained and it is adding 150 million over three years under the fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France considers that the funding of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words,there is no reference to expenditure in previous periods or to the overall level of ODA.
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) and must comply with its commitment to finance 'new and additional ...'
Another crucial factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, think that a euro borrowed is equal to a euro given.
Obviously, it's hard to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investment that is profitable (often emissions reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro we receive as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not understand it as a title to our liabilities but as a loan price to the creditor country (i.e. equivalent interest rate).
But France can only justify this: it 'fulfils' its commitment of €420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% is a donation (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are meeting their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, if the absolute majority of the European Union gives €1 to fulfil its promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
That's a beautiful piece of popcorn!
In conclusion, in its financing of the 'fast start', France operates with a double-track approach: on the one hand, with the development of the action over time and, on the other, with the real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it is able to convince the public that it is spending €420 million 'new and additional' in line with its promises.
Manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that Bercy was the one who made the decision) could have a double negative impact, both inside the EU (why would member states continue to donate when they can only lend?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early finance is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But she could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to draw on the lessons of this first year of early funding.
France should first notify a change in its accounting practices for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid the discussion on contributions to long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we do not avoid the question of 'additionality' or the way loans are accounted for.
France should change its attitude to become as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone's hopes are in the new environment minister, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who's coming to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans could raise the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
A warning about pesticides that children swallow.
A ten-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Future Generations Association (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no statistical significance given the small number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the subject matter", bought food normally eaten in four meals and one light snack per child of about ten years old in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical foods, which include the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sweets, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five substances are classified as clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptors of the endocrine glands (EPs), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our research clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogens, and/or PE is staggering", says the association.
Butter and milk tea for breakfast alone contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three that have been shown to be certain carcinogens, as do about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, described in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same is true for Kenyan green beans, which are included in the lunch, and in which the study found traces of potent insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steaks, canned tuna, and even goose and gum were peppered with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues found, and even the analysis of a plastic plate used to heat food in a microwave did not escape analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this 'cocktail of contaminants' is probably underestimated,' the study concludes.
The Ecological Europe-Green (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on pesticide use to halt the "rise in civilization diseases" "in the face of an urgent situation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
