Food inflation in Europe has spiked
The acceleration in inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the steady rise in food prices.
November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1% after 2.6 percent in October, the Union statistical office in Luxembourg reported.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate on the grounds that a reduction, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "discourage" inflation so that it will not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent is a 15-year high; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has spiked due to the sharp rise in food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose 88 percent, and soybeans hit their highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 there was a substantial increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products.
Oil prices on world markets have risen 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold was already worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump to 2.5% in 2008 from 2.1% this year, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect 12-month inflation to remain at around 3 percent over the next three to four months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's support circle, after a long period of stagnation, has grown significantly since early December, and it now has the largest support base since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never seen the Socialists receive such low support - 13 percent.
For certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support versus a fifth of MSMEs' support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support among the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there is a one percent increase in support for both camps.
Public opinion of the economy has also deteriorated from its previous low - the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be clearly very bad is as high as ever - 41 percent, while another 46 percent consider the situation to be quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about their changing financial situation after spring and summer.
As for next year, most people expect further deterioration and only a tenth expect improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the most ever in a Gallup poll, thought the prime minister was doing his job worse than he was doing it well.
Ferenc Gyurcsany is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The Prime Minister is not trusted at all by 54 percent, the Fidesz leader by 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While 35 percent of respondents said they wanted to keep the government and the prime minister after the October riots, the figure is now down to 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the only solution in holding new elections.
Interest in the referendum is indicated by the fact that 60 percent of respondents, when asked about their possible participation, said that the referendum would definitely take place and another 20 percent said that it would probably take place.
By comparison, "the parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly have only 55% turnout and another 15% would consider their participation likely.
School fees would be 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same percentages only among people who are definitely committed to participation, then 81, 84 and 89 percent would reject the introduction of tuition, doctor's fees and hospital fees.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more than Tesco.
Hypermarkets in the Budaöhr shopping triangle maintained last year's average price rise of 16%, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
An article in the Napi Gazdaság newspaper
The daily Napi Gazdaság's regular Christmas shopping basket in the Budaöster shopping triangle has risen by an average of 16 percent this year, but all hypermarkets have seen a rise in price of well over a thousand forints.
Since food prices in supermarkets "floated" in December last year, the percentage increase was not as drastic as the previous high base.
But it is certainly a source of distress to consumers that what they could easily buy for under $2,000 last year they cannot buy for $10,000 now.
The consumption basket of the daily economy in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of HUF 10,000 by at least HUF 91.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the cost of a basket was HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the price of raw breast, nuts and poppy seeds have risen sharply.
The prices of bread and flour were in line with the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchanan we found a kilogram of bread at 139 forints.
The competition did not go with a product price below 200 forints.
Also surprising at this store was that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the Napi Gazdaság Auchan consumer basket, Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket have risen by 15 percent compared to last year's Cora Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have risen by about 18 percent.
Comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the average increase was 1,480
The average price increase last year was HUF 1,206, with prices affected by the VAT increase last Christmas.
This process was the one that disrupted trade, the houses of commerce were obviously unable to decide how large the price differentials should be for each product, as they could not predict the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the product, the price range adjusted for the intensity of the circulation can result in significant profit being lost.)
Last year, the price of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper's shopping cart rose so sharply due to VAT that the price of the most expensive basket was HUF 1 720 higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was HUF 844 altogether.
This year, the difference is not so extreme, the most expensive basket is now 1630 forints more than last year and the cheapest one is also up by 1284 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons reveals a catastrophic rise in prices, raising the price of everyday goods in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not completely confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: it has measured price increases of more than 30 percent for several staple foods in 12 months.
Except for flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible, according to the consumption basket of the Daily Economy, since the price level of the product, already quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10 per cent in the worst case, in relation to the basis.
Flour suppliers seem to have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and the drastic price increases have also been able to be enforced in international chains.
The hypermarkets in the commercial golden triangle don't complain, they still report a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in bulk, they take durable food on wages.
On Wednesday morning, long lines formed at the checkout in all three supermarkets as the number of visitors soared.
But as we know, the turnover is lower in rural areas, and many international chains complain to research firms that their sales are falling behind their plans, not only in food but also in durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being spared
This year, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital hygiene, overcrowding, overworking of staff are not helping to stop the disease, says the director of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also being spared.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma ward of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
A patient who was seriously injured in a car accident was released home, but soon afterward he had to return with an MRSA infection and one major surgery was still not possible because of the bacteria in his system.
By December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, director of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens have been confirmed in hospitals, and so many others are unknown.
Almost two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxycillin-resistant staph.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried in the nose by one third of the population without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are given in excess or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics can develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in unsuitable hospital conditions.
In particular, in patients with weakened immune systems, low body weight or elderly patients, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's, MRSA is not unusual, and similar infections are a daily occurrence in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not only there", said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated".
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the medical staff treat them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are first screened for MRSA, but even then infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of MDR-TBs, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is most common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
Microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests also plays a role.
Most cases are detected when a patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, said the chief of the CDC.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical histories.
Efforts need to be made to target antibiotic therapy, or microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but even this is not always done by hospitals.
Microbiological samples are even rarer for primary and outpatient treatment, Karolina Böröcz said.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly transmitted between patients through healthcare professionals.
Handwashing and the use of gloves and masks are therefore very important, but serious shortcomings are also evident in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection and by touch, but in home hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, rooms are often overcrowded, beds are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz noted, hospitals in poor financial conditions may also experience a shortage of disinfectants, a shortage of nurses, and a high number of patients, thus increasing the risk of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where necessary protective measures are taken, similar infections are demonstrably less common or the disease-causing agent can be stopped from spreading further.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it's being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has a program to prevent or reduce MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, with published data showing a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has listed the prevention of the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens as one of its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert report on the case of the police captain of the XXII district who caused a fatal accident is complete.
The police captain of the XXII district who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, is not likely to have been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the spokesman for the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai said on Friday after the expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which had already found that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police department of the XXII district hit a 55-year-old man in his own car on Tuesday in Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII district, when he turned off the road, who had entered the road ahead of him when he was crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The fact that the pedestrian crossed the zebra, as mentioned later, is not, by the rules of the road, a mitigating circumstance; the car that turns must still take precedence.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of these events, the district police chief resigned and requested a transfer to retirement, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with the prosecutors from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund in 2006, with the parties having already concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract now signed covering the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also being used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which the budget will use mainly for a research and development project at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the fourth line of the metro.
The parties agreed that once Hungary had agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, they would return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990 with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year grace period and without a commitment fee shall be linked to the Euribor rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of all Europe is turning to a previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying in the still cheapest but fast-rising EU market?
The Commission notes that the Bulgarian authorities have not provided any information on the restructuring plan.
The most sought-after destination for property purchases in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski flats and seaside homes.
The most prominent mountains are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, while on the sea coast there are Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient towns of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also attract investors, and more and more people are also shopping in the vicinity of the cheaply laid out town of Ruse.
The capital, Sofia, also promises attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golfing paradises, becoming a popular destination for the summer and winter seasons as well as for the next two seasons.
The forecasting investors are already buying in large quantities, for example around Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
The majority of customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth €50,000 to €100,000 or dilapidated old houses worth €5,000 to €15,000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication facilities, and they are close to the big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the chat shoppers (Bulgaria was ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
The real estate auction in the capital is continuous, as demand is increasingly strong.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, it has been growing at an annual rate of 21 percent over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is far outpacing the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Affairs, Gabor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and after the official opening on Wednesday, the international conference on the post-2012 climate regime will continue with ministerial meetings.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries are working on the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts to postpone the Kyoto Protocol's emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not want to negotiate precise figures now, although it is committed to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another major issue at the conference is whether developed countries will not go beyond reducing emissions by providing both material and technological assistance to countries that depend on it.
The agreement also came about subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board, most likely within the UN World Environment Programme (WEP), Piac es Profit reports.
Hungarian six percent
Minister for the Environment and Water Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to up to 30% reductions if other developed regions of the world, and developed countries respectively, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments commensurate with their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves a reduction target of 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 percent.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent from 1985 to 1987, which our country will do. - A press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
Bali is a big deal, as an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy must be adopted within two years, or it would certainly not come into force until 2012, in which case the Kyoto Protocol's reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by a new emissions reduction regime, as the Nobel Peace Prize-winning UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also highlighted in its latest report.
This would delay emissions reductions and inevitably increase the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, with what scientists say would be extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British troops are posting videos from their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing site to promote themselves.
YouTube was first made popular by the RAF, which has been uploading videos of its operations against the Taliban since March 2006.
The footage, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, is monitored by the Air Force Command, which is in charge of combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent to London, where it is streamed on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have been posted online and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as a 'defenceheadquarters' and publishes recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force in Iraq (IPFMI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployed in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos as it originally intended for recruitment purposes and the Department of Defense says they are also good for informing the general public of the true purpose of the military presence abroad.
"The propaganda that is published in this form is almost inexpensive compared to traditional television recruitment ads", said Gordon Mackenzie, a BBC defence expert, "but it necessarily carries a political message, because it is a special form of validation of military action decided by the government".
The Americans have made a game
The army is concerned that amateur videos, such as those showing the deaths of soldiers, are being uploaded to the server alongside carefully edited, censored videos: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the officers only talk about casualties, but the bloody aspect of the battle is not shown.
There have been many videos of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been posted online, but the British military has only just discovered them.
The Americans do recruitment a little differently -- using a free-to-download shooter game called America's Army, where the player can get right into the soldiers' shoes through a more or less faithful simulation.
There will be a Christmas with a towel and a baguette in the ministries
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she is hosting a final working meeting for her colleagues, where she bids 2007 farewell with a cup of coffee and a bagel.
Some ministries will have a celebration with live music, while others will give officials a Christmas treat with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a coffee table - that's how the powerful have fun.
The government is preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas party in the history of the Department of Defense is being held this year, but it's not expected to attract any employees.
On Orphans' Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, on Mission Christmas, the families of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, but they also host a reception for journalists.
The resort is spending $25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of step with other departments.
The GKM party is being held in the centre of Jövő Háza, at a total cost of 4,320,000 forints and around 350 guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the ministry.
The resort will celebrate Christmas traditions, but will also host performances and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas party costing HUF 4,700,000 was held on Wednesday at the State Council of Justice (OIT) building, with concerts and dinners.
The hall cost a million forints to rent, and the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one of the NFÜ's departments is invited to another Christmas party: the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), is hosting it with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information as we could not contact the person concerned.
No need for a suit.
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held a St Lucia ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
But the ILO did not want money from him for using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with the minister's greeting, and after dinner, there was a chance to dance to live music.
According to the answer to a question from the [origo] portal, evening dresses or suits were not required at all.
The Puritan party is being organized by the Departments of Health, Labor and Local Government.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and a party for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
The Minister of Labour, Monica Lamperth, is not officially inviting her staff to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
The 180 guests are counted, and according to the press release, they will only get coffee and bagels, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai and his staff are simply toasting in the lobby of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas gathering, which is expected to attract 436 employees, in its own grand hall.
For the Christmas party, he spends 2,500 forints per guest - the total includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since the time of Minister János Veres, the PM's staff have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
The party atmosphere will be lacking, however, as the formality is enhanced not only by the ministerial speech but also by the afternoon session.
The Ministry of Agriculture is holding a New Year's reception on January 20th, and there will be no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in Městské sady and according to the ministry, there will be a fee of 1,000 forints per person for 100 guests.
According to the press office, it will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a small feast.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold any Christmas parties, the press department told the [origo] portal.
The Environment Ministry's press office was unable to announce the price of the Christmas celebration.
In any case, 400 people were invited to a party at the Museum of Fine Arts.
There's a big strike coming up.
The League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers' Councils will form their own strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A public protest rally is being held on Saturday, and a work stoppage on Monday, the final day of the vote on the health insurance bill.
The action is sure to cause serious disruption to traffic, as railway traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 1 pm.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will share details of Monday's joint strike.
There will also be a strike committee called LIGA-MOSZ to coordinate Monday's action.
A public protest rally is held on Saturday, and from Monday, the unions joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If Parliament does not finally pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the call for strike immediately.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next step.
According to the agenda of the Monday session of Parliament, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
The strike, which begins on Monday, is expected to cause major disruptions to traffic: work on the railway will be suspended indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may be stopped in the morning and more than half of Volán's companies may be shut down.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the runway will be closed.
The strike has been joined by numerous trade unions and civil society organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations have called an indefinite strike, others have announced a temporary stoppage of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not agree on even sufficient services, as more people travel by rail as the Christmas holidays begin.
According to the reports so far, there will be a strike at the BKV from the start of the operation until 1 p.m., a four-hour strike at the Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 a.m., a strike organized by the unions of workers in the energy industry LIGA, a two- and two- and eight-hour strike called for by the Union of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and put forward a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new way of calculating pensions, which will be applicable from next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, early retirement should be made available to the occupations concerned before 2010.
The fourth ground for action is that the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), which is part of the League, does not accept the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport's offer for the railway sections and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases risk to country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, established with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért in August this year, according to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital Institute, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The company's 'risk warning' states that the biggest political risk in the Hungarian Guard's activities is that 'the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population in Hungary may escalate into violent ethnic clashes in the short term'.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, this can all be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian politicians: "public debate on the Roma question was left by public figures to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, the institute said.
Furthermore, the Hungarian Guard's activities, according to the research institute, have caused a great deal of attention in the domestic and foreign media, "which has greatly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of belief in the country's stability and democratic development".
The Institute recalls that, as part of the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been receiving ever greater publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, several organisations calling themselves 'national civil defence' associations have been established in Hungary since summer 2007.
"What these groups have in common is that they define themselves as civil society organizations while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, invasion of the homeland, disruption of order), and pointing to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state", he adds.
He further notes: all this is done in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built on society's resistance to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
The emphasis on the civic and form of the association therefore not only serves to avoid the legal obstacles of judicial registration in these groups, but is also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighboring countries as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist political leaders in some neighboring countries have sought to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can have an impact on the political stability of the region", he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
According to him, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The Bulgarian Guard was formed after mass Roma riots broke out in one of Sofia's neighbourhoods (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard, with the aim of "national defense".
She says that while there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, the state has remained passive and indifferent.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
He also said that the increased risk of ethnic clashes was signaled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they would form their own guard in response to the resistance.
As the activity of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own homeland defence, according to a risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
In an interview with the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at the Institute for Political Capital, said:
As he said, they publish a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
The holidays aren't free everywhere.
In Hungary, the days off are strictly regulated by law and it has become common practice to move the working days around the holidays, which we will see less of next year.
There is no uniform holiday in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and days of rest.
Labor days are usually associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Eve: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are public holidays - for the New Year's Eve so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
We have a total of 11 holidays off during the year.
The national holiday is March 15th, the anniversary of the 1848 revolution, and October 23rd, the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st we celebrate labor, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, state, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become the practice to move the working day to a day off when we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we stay at work and school the Saturdays before.
The date on which we work on the day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated for many years by a special decree of the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to civil servants and to persons in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to firms and institutions which operate continuously or which, by reason of their function, also operate on days of rest.
This year, the change in working hours will be around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, as experience shows that most people "work" in advance or use the vacation saved between Christmas and New Year.
Next year, a few of our holidays fall in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer workdays than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be reversed around Labor Day, so that workers can stay home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd, may be a day of rest.
The next shift is due to the holiday of 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be working day instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year will be marked by a holiday, since almost everywhere will be on a nonstop holiday from December 24 even though New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can do to piss off your coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never get, innocent lies we barely notice: all of this adds to the daily grind at work.
The question is, do you get used to these little inconveniences, or do you put on gloves and deliberately avoid ambiguous situations that might upset others?
The tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you", your colleague will tell you.
That's why you missed the meeting?
At best, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message along (a less common solution).
Most of the time, an apology is the answer.
Before making an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare for unpleasant moments and deliberately try to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for some paperwork or office supplies or your phone and they're not there.
Do you remember putting the stapler on your desk yesterday, but it was gone by morning?
Or did you discover a pen on the desk of a colleague that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be rightfully angry at you for going through their things.
Do not bring envelopes or adhesive paper from the office, as it may be uncomfortable to run out of them prematurely, and you will need them immediately.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors from spreading.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don't give everyone your opinion about your colleagues' private lives!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Keep what you hear to yourself, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
You're reporting an absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report that you are absent because you are not feeling well or that you would rather rest today, remember that your work, urgent tasks, and deadlines will have to be done by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be at work the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay home, report it so that your colleagues and supervisors do not have to face your absence until the next day.
Screaming, whining, calling the phone.
You've been immersed in a job that you've been brutally ripped out of by a fellow employee?
Have you unwittingly witnessed a telephone conversation that you would rather not hear at all?
Do not disturb your coworkers by shouting, singing, shouting (over their heads), or banging, constant whining, loud complaining.
All of this can be distracting even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something is late or you forget to send an important letter or message, do not blame someone else for your forgetfulness!
Don't make any reference to the possible chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit if you have made a mistake and someone has paid the price, and repair the damage!
Ask how you can make things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Tights and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not for the office!
Don't wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming into the office in plain clothes - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When you want to fit in, you're not interesting.
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
The radio will play a strange melody: the sound of violins, with electronic effects.
I'm turning up the volume.
The music changes its tempo and the bass is added to the previous tonal coloration, then the female chorus joins in like a real gem.
On mr2 is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music life hasn't been spoiling us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
But suddenly, the traffic looks a little different because you're listening to Zagara's new album.
The Yonderboy phenomenon, a couple of exciting new productions coming out of the home digital underground is slowly changing the overall picture, and while garage rock is back in vogue with its guitar-beating, home electropop is proving that there's something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Pentatonix and he also played in the Yonderboi band, until finally - perhaps because two pipers don't fit in one row - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he only started to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film is based on the novel by Ferenc Török.
His band, initially playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their 2002 debut album among the 50 most important domestic records and declared Zagar on Yonderboy almost the only domestic act to have a development that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band are definitely on track, although of course no one asked them if they were happy with the label.
The band responded appropriately: they made a new, better album.
Now released, Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, although the title itself tries to create a continuation of their early flights in the Pentathlon.
It's a line from a song by the old band Balázs Zsójer.
The reference to the ethereal, the flying would be appropriate, but alongside the ethereal breath of this music, there is now, in keeping with the spirit, the trend of the time, a louder guitar, a rock and roll influence.
These songs featured singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, at the album's premiere in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which recently played popular music from morning to night, we started to get stuck with the lush melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is all right ?
The news portal Hvg.hu has interviewed Balas Zsiater.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question is, how much of what you're playing is still fringe music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different kinds of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and just like that it can be made just for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can spring from a sincere inner need.
This is the spirit of the attitude, as it is adopted, regardless of language or national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B.Z.: In foreign countries, especially in the West, light music has a larger tradition.
Not only do teenagers and people in their 20s go to concerts there, but older people too.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music around them, because they also see it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many people listen to your music?
B.S.: Of course, it's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more apparent in concerts where the mutual influence is already in effect, but it is only hidden in the intangible changes of the moment.
Yet I've noticed that when you try to please an audience, you're not interesting anymore.
How far are you going to follow Yonderboy's lead?
He's a solo artist and he's made his career out west.
B.Z.: We don't really go that route, despite the fact that that's how they sometimes try to explain our music.
We're more like team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
Of course, at first, we couldn't avoid being compared to Yonderboy, because a few of us had split from his band and gone our separate ways.
In the top list of mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love reached number one.
Many of you heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a more popular style, you've deliberately opened up to a wider audience?
B.Z.: We didn't plan on writing a hit record that would sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as a final album, trying to release the previous sonic orgy and more complex themes.
How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it -- what was the main principle?
BZ: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then the idea came up to put together this choir of female soloists from the local music scene with good voices.
So this six-piece choir was formed - Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed Underground Divas.
Is this what you intended the song to be, or did the girls rework it?
BZ: The song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version, and then when the material came together for the record, we thought that we needed something more for this song.
The chord sequence was tempting to be joined by a chorus.
I sang to him that night a tune that the girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course, that took Wonders.
It wouldn't work that vigorously with my voice.
WB: On the record and at the concert, it seemed like there were girls in the background.
They have no solos (except for Judy Jay), they have no roles of their own, they sing completely together, and they are not louder than the music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Did you do it on purpose?
BZ: The only reason they were standing back was because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to give out solo roles is deliberate.
Even that song is about letting go of our ego, where we come from, where we belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wish that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born could be felt by others.
Which one was the hardest to work with?
BZ: In the process of composing music, actually, with not one, the heavier pieces were more likely to come up during the mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play the concert violin, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where groove doesn't work for a long time, then everything just kind of kind of kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of
What's your favorite song from the new album?
BZ: That's always changing with the gigs and the fact that I've already released the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A rogue broker risked billions on his inferiority
A masterful swindler.
That is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the Commercial Bank of France, refers to its employee Jerome Kerviela.
It cost almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compete with his peers and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early.
"He is mentally weak", said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But according to Kerviel's testimony, which was reported by French media, such as Le Monde, he was a man who had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he says in his statement.
Last summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the American crisis.
He saw an opportunity earlier this year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, given to low-income clients or those who have had trouble paying back in the past, will have problems.
But the whole economy was not affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made the right bet.
At the end of the year, its profit amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"After I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it", admits Kerviel, adding that he had nothing to spare.
He admits to falsifying the records to avoid detection.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though his business was being floated on the Eurex.
The risk was the gain.
Was he afraid he'd be found?
I'm not sure.
"I thought the simple fact that I had made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Where did he get the will to take such a risk?
He had to work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant realtor, and in 2005, he became a freelance realtor with a salary of $90,000 a year.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
For my education and also for my professional and personal development", Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after he took office, his first big break came.
Allianz's shares made him a fortune, as he had bet half a billion euros on the decline of the title during the London bombings.
And that was the trigger -- he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew or suspected.
"While I was earning money, they turned a blind eye".
But then a blow came earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it off.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only picked four days in the past year.
A broker who does not have a licence is a broker who does not want his records to be seen", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers and the European Commission yesterday signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) over the coming years.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not provided any evidence that the measures in question are compatible with the internal market.
Around CZK 125 billion will be allocated to the regions from the seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme, accounting for up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year to an amount of CZK 90.8 billion.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and firms to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should be able to raise funds to introduce new technologies, to conduct industrial research, but also to implement more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the newly admitted countries in its use of EU funds to date.
The 20 year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua has been upheld by the court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will be back in prison is not clear at this time, according to the Associated Press.
According to the president of the court of appeals Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison authorities whether to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
A court found Alemán four years ago to have regularly moved government money into accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were actually owned by his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund Alemán set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been passed.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year was passed last year with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the no-confidence vote, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives has passed this traditionally overlooked, albeit most influential, bill.
It's a paradox of some sort.
Every administration begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether anyone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it's hidden behind a power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It's more media-grateful, and that's why it gets a lot more media attention.
Politicians' guesses are much more interesting to the public than hard numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments suffered from three ills that the 2008 one is not able to solve all at once:
The first is the high proportion of mandatory expenditure, which is not only pensions but also social benefits, which was approved by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM before the elections last year.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first's failure.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
But the ticking time bomb is the deficit in city and municipal budgets.
To obtain additional sources of investment in addition to tax, fee, and bank loans, many mayors often recklessly issue bonds that over-indebted their city halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by selling off shares in power and other distribution networks that they received from the state through privatization.
Now they don't have that resource.
If we stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting about ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her government to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan, Egypt, managed much more sensibly than our republic.
It is a huge shame, which falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
This is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately become gigantic in recent years.
Even if we can get rid of some of the nonsensical populist spending that was approved before this year's election, if we don't move the retirement age and pension reform soon, then in fact, any politics in this country will be over and no matter who governs it will be a mere bureaucracy.
It is a little exaggerated to say that politicians in power will become bureaucrats, mechanically distributing most of the taxpayers' money to pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot therefore be revolutionary, but can only suspend the printing of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if the previous governments had not managed the last ten years as well as they could.
If we do not want to see the politicians in power become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it can get on taxes and fees, time to prepare further reform legislation.
Only these will allow a balanced state budget to be achieved gradually.
The Krejci
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to work together to combat the crisis in financial markets.
This brings more than $100 billion to the stock market through auctions.
In these auctions, banks bid at the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will auction off $40 billion, and the other $24 billion will be made available to European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to preventing or mitigating the effects of a financial crisis.
"This move is designed to address the economy's biggest problem, the growing shortage of free capital for banks to lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group in a report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in bad loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more in losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what might follow if they have chosen this approach", said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, banks will lend to their customers.
That would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible repercussions for economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this decision after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will help to avert the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the US housing market.
The environmental debate is incredible.
The developing countries are expected to be the hardest hit by global climate change.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now been leveled at the concluding UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green, he said that the ecologists' debates were incredible.
Klaus said that not only is the conference's structure, which is a strange mix of government and NGO representatives, unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are substitutes for solutions to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, stressed that the subject matter is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book was also appearing in a German translation, since, as he said, "I often find only caricatures of my views".
So now the interested can read his unvarnished stances.
Klaus reminded us that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has enough qualifications to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and evaluate professional papers, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
He made the main conclusions that climate change is constant and therefore normal, that there is no universal scientific consensus on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are futile, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as someone with experience with totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license failed to change 600,000 people
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to change their old driving licences, which expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for a new ID before the authorities can issue a new one by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not worried that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the most unable to change their license are those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a sharp decline in interest in changing their licenses, the city's offices are overwhelmed with requests and interest in changing licenses has surged this week.
The Magistrate's office handles about 2,000 clients a day.
The line's been up for about a half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their license.
It takes 20 days to get a new ID.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay an extra 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to meet the mandatory license change by the end of the year and hit the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine starting January.
The guilty party will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But a cop can also settle a misdemeanor by plea bargain.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is up to 2500 crowns.
According to the earlier information, even a man who doesn't go anywhere could get a ticket from the city council.
He was said to have paid up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously urged the authorities to be moderate and impose a fine of up to 1,000 crowns.
But according to transport ministry spokesman Karl Hanzelka, the $10,000 fine is not a threat to anyone.
He says that a driver's license is a document that people can use to decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a valid ID that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their license.
It is simply to be delivered or sent by registered post to the appropriate municipal office.
The passes issued between 1964 and 1993 will expire at the end of the year.
But motorists must gradually replace other types of licenses.
People with IDs from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange them.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there's about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konyaric, who are accused of criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague High Court decided in a final decision, reducing the sentences of one by one year and the other by two years.
Initially, detectives from the Prague Organized Crime Unit were threatened with 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is still awaiting a verdict.
However, in other trials, he has already received sentences totalling over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
The District Court found 19 people guilty of participating in the robberies in January, the Supreme Court today heard appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, the police, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30% of the loot to Opava and Horseman.
The charges relate to gang activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, which often result in serious damage to the health of the victims, but also abuse of public authority and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, police found illegal handguns, steel-cores, laser sights, and machine guns.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still testifying in court in other trials, some cases have not yet gone to trial.
The main trial has so far been avoided for Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to face prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Child exchange account: 12 million
For the mistaken children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants from the Třebíč hospital 12 million crowns in compensation, plus court costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father, and one million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's lawyer Ondřej Dostál therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it's very, very high", he said after today's hearing.
'However, in order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion which the counter-party has had drawn up.
We'll see if it has any telltale value at all.
We are still of the opinion that it will be in the hundreds for everyone", Dostál stressed.
He said the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablonowo wanted a million crowns for every month they didn't raise their biological daughter.
Veleb was informed of the expert opinion prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motola.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
Men were better able to cope with stressful situations, even though they faced regrets that they had not prevented newborn confusion.
Women, on the other hand, are less likely to cope with the trauma of the past and what is happening right now, Veleb summarized.
Veronica and Nicole were switched by the nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9th last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermakov in Pribyslav and Veronika to Libor Brozh and Jaroslav Trojanov in Jablonyov.
Hejtman Miloš Vystrčil handed each of the families 100,000 crowns at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability for damage.
In case of doubt, they must call on the reserve fund, and exceptionally they can ask the founder for help.
The courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, with amounts calculated on the basis of tables in the hundreds of thousands, rarely in the millions.
Soup lost the Wallachian kingdom
Soupy lost a dispute over the mark of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the name was first used by the King of Wallachia, the project built a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor, after many years of work.
Soup didn't attend the meeting today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Soup Stink", said Soup's lawyer after the trial.
He says that when people hear the words of the Wallachian Kingdom, they remember the actor and the comedian.
Harabis is of the same opinion.
"We've been working on this for almost a decade.
"Making money and making up stories", he said.
He says the problem is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasitize on our work", he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the first time the King of Wales used Soup was on his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But back then, it had nothing to do with the idea of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary action resulted in trade and lucrative business activity, which was followed by the establishment of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts on visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used a bare idea that Soup published in a manifesto for his business plan.
"The popularity of the Bolesław Soup project of the Wallachian Kingdom certainly helped", the judge said.
But she added that the heart of the project was Harabiš and his team, who worked hard on it.
The cooperation of the now-disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Soup in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have been building up between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I. elected for life".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen mother at Harabiš's urging.
Then in 2002, the soupman filed a lawsuit against Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
It's clear that Harabis's impending bid for the throne and half a princess could bring him into dispute.
He should be the new king.
He didn't want to give details or a date yet.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It should be like a King's Ride in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period.
Mr. Soup can also sign up", added Harabiš.
The test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the disappearance of prejudices
To tell you the truth, I've never been much of a Peugeot 206.
Its performance was not great, the quality of gearbox, steering and production could be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the SUV called SW is a little further along, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I was testing a classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the backseat.
That's the end of the complaint, because the body of the station wagon means that even the six-foot tall won't suffer in this direction.
♪ Flying through the world ♪
I'm gonna go through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty good design, where I have a single outlet to the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here, given the car's look.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could have complained about the short seats or the backrest.
The lateral conductivity has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In terms of space, you can feel the increase in body size.
Then the van eliminates the aforementioned lack of space above the head.
The suitcase
So the main thing about this car is its trunk.
I have to say it's very accessible (and it's got a folding rear window) and decent folding.
Deaf areas are equipped with restraint tires, which are an ideal compromise.
It's non-invasive, stretchable, and can hold heavier objects.
But let's pause together over volume.
The basic layout of the table shows a volume of 428 litres, which is rather average compared to the competition.
But not against the best-selling car in the Czech Republic in this class - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Jugoslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging by a very noticeable 52 litres.
This value is critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a cart.
But if I were to pick the positive, I would also have to mention the perfectly flat floor after the second row of supports folded or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16 should look like driving a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low power, and most of all, it pulls.
Compared to the time of the pest, which often seems to have a rag stuffed in its exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The appraiser will advise
The price of the car is not popular.
But we must remember that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a gasoline-powered 14-wheel-drive car is still $49,000.
Our generator costs from $410 to $400, which is quite enough.
The premium equipment tested will then add an additional CZK 80,000.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatically activating the wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
It's just that the car costs everything.
It's a lot, but add up the spare parts at Fabie's and you'll come up with a very similar number.
So all we have to do is pick a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
The increase in Eastern European children in British schools has raised concerns among local settlers about the future of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even report cases where conflicts between immigrant and Native children have escalated into violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated by the case of north Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguing, bullying, and fighting among students have spread to parents.
The situation escalated to the point that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The defendant defends the boy's use of racist slurs.
Police had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"On our way home, a boy got on the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he leaned over us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass", another mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One local settler even described the conflict with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here to work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can come true if you choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or a sea as calm as a pond.
Palm and all inclusive with waiters serving pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find a more complete and rich list.
But there's only one island that has so much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and transshipment point for the treasures that the Spanish plundered in the Americas and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. He was a great man.
Havana was a city of high-rise buildings, with cars that were iconic of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio were signed by stars of show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can sign your name on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar at the expensive Hotel Nacional will serve you a cocktail of your choice.
And those iconic cars from the '50s are still driving through Havana because the once-imported gigs and Fiat cars have long since rotted in that salty, damp air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is largely dilapidated, there are no colonial monuments as beautiful as here.
Other places are also becoming beautiful, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in so much needed money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba offers another delicacy that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by train drivers.
One third of the vast plantations were tied to sugar mills by narrow-gauge steam and rail trains.
Their fleet has not been updated for many decades, and so there are machines in operation that are only found in museums elsewhere.
Where to?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
So, Varadero or Havana, there's not much to write about.
Perhaps I should remind you that Hemingway's mansion is a museum and that lovers of the writer should not miss a visit.
The Viñales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba, located in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
The mounds, limestone hills, and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and the fertile soil in their hollows is sequestered, making the weathered rock cover with dense vegetation.
The valley is home to perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco.
You can see his final form if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Some of you might find it interesting that it was the filming location for a Chilean production of Major Zeman.
Other
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and sugar brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth turned into the beauty and exhibition of a small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has remained virtually unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that even in the 1950's, there was no road that connected the area to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay out of it.
Nothing was built, and therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was happy to have a roof over their head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, the nearby attractions, such as Playa Ancón and the Valley of the Sugar Beetles, are worth seeing.
In the evening, you can visit the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and the music subsides in the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the far east of Cuba that some have called the most beautiful on the island.
Surely, the journey itself has a bearing on that view.
Both roads leading from Guantanamo must cross high, jagged mountains and pass through a landscape that has been almost untouched by human activity.
The eastern tip of Cuba has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was built about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage), and from the hill where the former castle and the present-day El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
There are many pages to describe about coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions that profess descendants of former slaves.
But as they say, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
The United States believes that the lack of troops and equipment is affecting the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, officials from countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also discussing plans and coordination with allies.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, this week called for more NATO troops, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and increasing development aid.
"The developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the people to take charge of their own economic and security development", British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is the highest in five years, according to the US military.
Violent incidents have risen by 27 percent in the past year, including 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But the United States says the Allies have reached their limits in terms of organization and equipment.
Specifically, they're requesting additional helicopters, troops and experts to train Afghan forces.
"We're going to have to think seriously about specific goals for the time ahead and ways to achieve them", Gates said.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
There have also been disputes in recent months between the countries involved over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a fairly large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the south and east of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan pilgrims exposed: Germans playing while our boys fight", Sun wrote in the footage, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and printed a picture of a British soldier at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will balloon to a trillion in 2009
The national debt of each Czech is over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion, due to better state budget management.
The Czech Republic's public debt increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, it has fallen by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its figures for the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Over the course of the past year, the state has accumulated more than 111 billion crowns in debt.
"For now, it seems that a lower deficit next year could not exceed the one trillion crowns mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, for iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora says: "We could cross the trillion mark during 2009.
Exactly when will depend on the next budget, which we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the political situation would change, that politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not expect this change", he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt is the central government's debt and is mainly the result of the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debt has so far this year increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached CZK 803,3 billion at the end of September and decreased by CZK 13,7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6,5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent year over year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform comes", Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159,2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion, due to better state budget management.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the forecast CZK 91.3 billion.
The planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13,3 billion, a pension reserve of CZK 10 billion, the financing of CZK 43 billion in government bonds and the repayment of CZK 1,8 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deported by a Khartoum court on Thursday night, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear Mohammed despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was subjected to the punishment of whipping.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for their class teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Muhammad", says school principal Robert Boulos.
After a classroom vote, 20 of the 23 children will ultimately choose the name Muhammad as their favorite.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear and the words, "My name is Muhammad".
The bear himself had no tag with that name on it, but the problem is the very portrayal of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of her fellow Muslims, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that would be offensive to any religious faith: "My only regret is that she asked children to vote for a name", he said, "it's just an innocent mistake".
Many of her students share that view, describing her as "very attentive to her students" and adding that "she never talks about religion in class".
Recall that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given first name in the United Kingdom, with fourteen different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can you give them to a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
The last round of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
It's a failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, unable to resolve their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the status", European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His US counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to peace and remain ready for dialogue after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence anytime soon, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense".
Negotiations will end on December 10th.
The troika of negotiators, made up of representatives from the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population speaks Albanian, could be in a clearer light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to present their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN authorized the Troika to conduct new negotiations in August this year.
The Americans and Europeans expect the talks to be concluded on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence at the UN Security Council, insist that talks continue beyond that deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated, compromise solution", Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community administration, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement", Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the "last-chance talks" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel leader of Kosovo Albanians and future premier of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Dominus effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that compromise is still possible and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about a "dominance effect" in a region still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia", he said, "that does not mean that compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be made exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say"
'The only solution acceptable to Serbia is one that comes from the Security Council,' declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"This negotiation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the floor of the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be with the Kosovo parliament", adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin talks immediately to resolve the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations of both sides under the "road map" to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues".
The declaration covers three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the 1948 conflict in what is now the State of Israel.
Abbas followed the US president and stressed that the follow-up talks should be "comprehensive and thorough" and should cover all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Olmert then took the stand and expressed the view that the follow-up negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "we should strive to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for his "vision of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has indicated that it accepted a commitment from Bush to this effect even before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories captured in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis stands as "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is fighting the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with an Arabic-language newspaper sponsored by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., the cops are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such petty reports from the Black Chronicle, the official version does not match what is being said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car passed by Louise-Michel Street in the commune of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5pm on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in emergency mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights on", a police source explained.
A Kawasaki green motorcycle, "not registered, and therefore not authorized to drive on public roads" (see below), driven by two young men without helmets, was travelling "at very high speed".
"The motorcycle slammed into the police car from the left after failing to turn to the right", said one officer.
The blood alcohol test for the crew member's blood alcohol was negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had been entrusted with the investigation of "acts of accidental killing and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which is also being handled by the direction départementale de la sécurité publique du Val-d'Oise (Departmental Police Directorate of the Val d'Oise).
At the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation excludes, at this stage, police responsibility for the accident.
Three witnesses who were questioned on Sunday night confirmed "the police's version that the minivan approached them from the left rather quickly", the official said.
Some kind of tear, no doubt caused by the clips rubbing against the ground, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained locked until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will be subjected to a technical expertise.
Both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people quickly began to talk about the fact that the police should have left the scene quickly without giving first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN was also to rule out, with all caution, 'any serious misconduct' in this respect.
"It's a more difficult aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and needs to be handled with great care", a police source said.
The daily "Libération" met with an eyewitness in the moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to the accident site.
"Immediately, my cousin, a nurse at the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resuscitate them", the Witness relates.
There was nothing we could do".
Then he saw "a limping, terrified police officer.
Two others tried to resuscitate one of the young men, and the fourth was talking on the phone".
Faced with rapidly rising tensions and the assurance of those present that the situation of the young men was hopeless, the officers were driven away by a car of their colleagues, who had meanwhile arrived on the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the officers left".
They also gave him a heart massage, but to no avail.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not come to the aid of the youngsters.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters came immediately.
Everything was done to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades, which witnesses said were used by law enforcement.
The last of the designated responded with stones, injuring several officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi where police attacked and injured lawyers.
A few of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement won the support of religious parties in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "has urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and trash to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
"Musharaf's promise is not valid"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the target of a state of emergency declared Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election held on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court rulings", the official told The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to step down as army chief and become a civilian president is "not valid" after the imposition of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed that the January election could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy army chief should have ordered President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected
This calculation includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected, according to a study by France's Institut national d'études démographiques (INED), the National Institute for Demographic Studies, 40 years after the Neuwirth law legalized contraception in France.
This calculation includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still have a 5% to 6% failure rate, estimates Ined.
The legalization of contraception has only made it possible to improve "fertility control", says the institute, noting that the use of hormonal contraception among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 percent in 1970 to 60 percent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
In fact, one in five couples have their births scheduled for exactly one month, preferably in the spring, which is considered the most favorable time of year for having a baby.
Remarkable Repair of the Space Station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to remarkably repair a torn solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific work.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records for duration, distance from the living modules, speed at which it was planned, and the amount of "cornering" the astronauts put in to repair.
The problems arose on Tuesday as the astronauts of the spacecraft Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit intended for installation by a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing moles for the lab modules.
But you have to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17-and-a-half-ton solar module already on the ISS to anchor at its final location.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the module's 600-foot solar array.
And in this one, one of the panels, which was disintegrating like a pull accordion, was damaged by a crack in the cable, almost three feet.
The decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally scheduled to make a controlled ascent on the spacecraft Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel that had a malfunctioning rotation system were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly on the end of the ship's robotic arm, attached to the station arm, and do the repairs.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, stout, very agile, with a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this former medical professional was commissioned to "operate" on a "wounded" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut the faulty cable and attached a "rafter" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the stabilization chamber, and also from inside by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, crew chief.
The device he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electric shock to solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and "sliced" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely dismantled, then inventoried his tools and returned to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts will return to the spacecraft Discovery, to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defence company announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1,4 billion to deal with the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its projected production results for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the maiden flight.
The price for mitigating the delay in the delivery of the military cargo plane, announced in October, was set at '€1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which over €1 billion for Airbus', the parent company of European manufacturer EADS said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Belgian authorities on the measures in question.
The Group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS's production results in 2006 fell by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
The group had originally envisaged delivering the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's election will be held without any tension: Russians will vote overwhelmingly for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming, after a very few free election campaigns, their tendency towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public television stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that is supposed to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president kept his mouth shut and settled for another attack on the West accused of meddling, his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want the fairest, most transparent and open elections possible, elections without the slightest flaw in the beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's far from that.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never before have there been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting the country, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovietica"
The background to this tense election is two far more open questions:
- "Who will be Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
But no successor appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
He's going to be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the parliamentary elections as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel they are masters of their own destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant context: civil society has become backward in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin continued a paternalistic model of state that was well accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror but by a certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Russians today "voluntarily renounce personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor, concludes: "Why think?
The people in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored in a 27-kilometre-long archive in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were until then accessible only for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or her beneficiaries.
Eleven countries in charge of archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scholars and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is now complete, the opening took effect yesterday.
The information shall be provided in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to study "in particular the movements of prisoners, the camp population and the health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were against making these named documents public because of the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities of some of the deportation victims?
The logs of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labored civilians, to provide them with proof of their internment in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some in the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach free trade agreements by 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India now amounts to almost EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (AFTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its number one foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
"The free trade agreement will be a tremendous boost for both economies" and "India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for every one of India's top 10 exports, the European Commissioner said. 'The Asian and European giant together exchange €47 billion in goods and €10 billion in services' a year, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, lamenting that bilateral trade 'has not yet reached its full potential'.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
The Bank of England has taken note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction.
The Bank of England on Thursday indicated it intended to allay current concerns about credit market conditions deteriorating again by announcing a £10 billion offer in a five-week auction at a 5.75% prime rate, an unusually long-term offer.
The Bank's capital base is EUR [100-100] million, of which EUR [100-100] million is for the Bank's operations in the banking sector.
The Bank specifies that the 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market from 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the base interest rate.
It appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE adds in its statement that it 'remains prepared to take further measures to maintain interbank interest rates' on interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates which discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation, reinforced by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many preferred the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and greater discretion.
The UMP (Union for a Popular Movement) and the NC (New Centre) refuse to deal with the Socialists' proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused on Thursday to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text of the bill was put on the agenda as part of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by a single parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the variable TIPP, the transport check or the regulation of rent.
As the UMP and NC voted against the individual paragraphs (180 to 115), the session was closed after a general debate which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club will re-submit the proposals in their entirety as additions to the Finance Bill, which will be debated by the Chamber next week.
A new festival is born
Due to much speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in association with British host Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"Our company is honored to work with a man who has unquestionably inspired the modern festival movement in America", said Charlie Jones of C3 at Billboard.com.
C3 is producing the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festivals.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to run from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as the Mean Fiddler, made him one of the world's most acclaimed festival promoters.
In 1989 he took over the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for production, licensing and organising the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of 177,500.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever experienced and says his firm and Melvin Benn's firm are working in tandem to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as the market, and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, the current administration has gotten us into politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we've had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're going to establish a great festival in a special place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after having emerged on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross revenues for both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn's festival is rural, whereas our festivals are more urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two concepts in a way that creates both a European and an American rural festival".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The town of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims 'that they are sufficiently favourable to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival which will hopefully last a long time'.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed as the program is still being printed.
"While Vineland will have a rock feel to it, the music will be varied to appeal to as wide an audience as possible", says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to attract Hollywood studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself is up against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegates' tasks.
But his mandate is "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall into the Governor's clutches?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer what they consider the best", he said.
The Hunt for the Festivals
For now, though, Denise Turcotte's priority is promoting local film.
The Oscars have already started.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about showcasing Quebec films, bringing them to the public's attention and making sure that the directors give interviews.
Dark Ages had a good run at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's being presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on sale in Santa Monica and will premiere in November at the 30th annual Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is there going to be a marathon at the end of the year?
With less than five weeks left until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already clutching at straws in anticipation of the traditional year-end marathon.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif considers that 'statistically December is a positive month on the stock exchange'.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially as, in the current context, markets are raising doubts, at least in the short term.'
The experts do not expect the stock market to move in the final weeks of the year and state that 'the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest given the lack of alternatives to collateral, especially solid income influenced by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in the long and short run'.
They therefore believe that the stock market will be rather quiet, not without volatility, "mainly because the impact of a likely fall in Fed (Federal Reserve) rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that now is not the time to make the bold statement that a marathon will take place.
"There is little reason to rejoice", he assures.
The Ibex lost almost 4% of its highs on 8 November, when it closed at 15 945.7.
Yet, not all experts are so negative.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year at just under 16 000 points, thanks to the re-grouping of portfolios and the traditional pension contributions that occur every year at this time.
However, this year, the expert suggests, things will be a little different, as he believes the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December, after an extended Constitution Day weekend.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "we could therefore see a reflection of the index, triggered by the US news about the consequences of the credit crisis".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts are in agreement on the securities that will ensure that the Ibex is brought up to the new maximum quotas.
Solana at Intermoney confirms that "this year is a big year for the headlines".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, 'because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.'
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
The construction companies will also be able to make a fortune on this marathon if it happens.
'ACS has been recovering its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit,' explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main focus in the latter part of the year, thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, even if it is not well represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
December has been a month of declines in only two cases in the last seven years.
The real end-of-year marathon was in 2003, the fiscal year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, where the Ibex 35 has recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (the Ibex has now risen by 8,36% since January) and whether it will manage to run its marathon at the end of the year.
200 Popular Bank branches will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
The same applies to other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to make the leap and to bet on continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and on Saturdays from 10.00 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group which has also repeatedly stated its intention to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it plans to strike a deal with the unions to cancel 75 percent of its Saturday opening hours in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for whether or not other entities join this initiative to promote opening hours.
This is precisely the aim of the project proposed by Popular Bank.
To attract individual customers who go to these places for their shopping, small and medium-sized businesses, tradesmen and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank intends to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as this is not a new branch opening but only a modification of the existing one.
The Bank will therefore modernise the branches it already has in the business areas by adapting them to the profile of its customers in the individual streets.
This is complemented by a new concept of the branch space and a new, more modern design in lighter colours.
The Bank's commercial director, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not involve a large investment but rather a greater recruitment of staff, as it will go from six to eight to nine employees per branch.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for SMEs and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banco Popular has already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
The branches were chosen in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
The Bank currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 specialised immigrant centres, which are run under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
The PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, whereby a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says Rivera.
They just made a deal with Telephonica to sell cell phones through outside staff.
Telecinco has doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock market.
We did it.
This was the statement made yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's CEO, expressing his satisfaction at the conclusion of the transaction, when he stated that the television he controlled had doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it was not because we were growing more, but because we were falling less,' he said.
He stressed that the weak market had 'reduced our decline'.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This profit carried their loss for the previous part of the year to 15,66%.
The market value of this company, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and Vozent (another 13%), thus amounts to EUR 4 488,88 million according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and 40.5% overall since January, has a half-price of $2,193.46 million.
The other telecommunications companies valued are Sogecable at 3,571 billion, Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) at 2,518,53 billion and Vocento at 1,779 billion.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is worthwhile, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do in the same market, at what cost and how we measure it in terms of viewership.'
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel to exceed one billion gross advertising revenues this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the forecast figures were indeed met, the channel would have recorded a 3.6% increase in advertising turnover this year, compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antenna 3's net turnover increased by 1,6 % (to 734,4 million), while its net income increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts have focused on for Telecinco's best relative performance on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to decide, this ratio could change following the acquisition of 33 per cent of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50 percent, 'though we have always claimed much more.
This year, I hope we can satisfy our shareholders, who have already increased Endemol's value by 33%.
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit forecasts for Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0,5 to 8,4 per cent in 2008 and from 5,5 to 5,1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3's projected profit by 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities primarily on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainability potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenna 3 (keep) because of its 'numerous advantages' and business growth.
3 and 4.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not overvaluing them as they face 'similar threats' (overcrowded market and deteriorating economic environment).
Congress has approved the transposition of MiFID effective November 1st.
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the novelties incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted a public hearing on the regulations that develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFI) that join securities firms, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments will be expanded by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges investment firms to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations carried out to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Moreover, the transposition of the Directive has been used to legally define the functions that may be held by bachelors in economics and business administration 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 defining the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate also included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as a broker who will work externally, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for different investment firms simultaneously.
The harmonised CPI increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides a preliminary indication of price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's (CEB) policy to provide data of a timeliness and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore may not necessarily coincide with the final figure to be published on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
The second deputy prime minister and minister for the economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1 % was a 'temporary figure', but predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively 'high level' in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes made clear in congressional speeches that "even if it is not a good figure", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
'We expected a value of around 4 %,' the Minister for Economic Affairs said of the figures presented today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros from Northern Rock in three years.
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (EUR 16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits of over £25 billion, which gradually fell over a period of two and a half months due to client distrust, even though the government offered a 100% guarantee on the money and would extend it until the crisis was over.
Virgin, which will replace the entity name with its Virgin Money trading name, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenues deposited in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion and reach the £30 billion target.
The group of Richard Branson, a tycoon known in the United Kingdom for his flashy advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about $70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week flagged the Virgin Consortium, which includes three other companies, as the preferred bid to save it from bankruptcy.
Totany Mayor arrested for alleged corruption in construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of Murcia Totana (of the People's Party) early this morning for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices that were exposed this week.
A city clerk and the local police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Deputy and mayor of the municipality, who according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police are still monitoring the city hall and the building committee and there are no signs of any more arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the indictment was filed against lawyer Juan Morales, the prime suspect in construction bribery practices uncovered earlier this week.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "people's" deputy Juan Morales, who was investigated, was arrested when he left Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales' alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction contract with a Galician construction company that had overclaimed 200 hectares of land is also under investigation.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono has accepted the offer to lead the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, if they win, to preside over the Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted an offer from Prime Minister and Socialist General Secretary José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to run for the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election and, if the Socialists win the general election, become President of the Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE's secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place today at noon at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and that Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marin as Congressman, who announced on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his active political career to focus on combating climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had repeatedly urged him to return to top politics, which he left two years ago.
He added that just as citizens know who will be the deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent way" who will chair the Congress.
If elected, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect, not of swearing or shouting", and to "become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak in peace and quiet is the Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate, on one occasion interrupted 26 times".
He also praised the current president, Manuel Marin, and "his good work", and did not want to put himself in his place so as not to reduce himself to what he said his opponents might consider "greatness".
The climate campaign
As the climate movement faces relentless persecution, both those skeptical of its predictions and those who favor other political and social struggles must show firm cohesion.
And to have a movement leader who is a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal requires him to explain why the actions or inactions of his government have contributed significantly to Spain's leading position in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the treaty government, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spanish people what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be hurt, what habits of the population will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective, will have to be made, and what will be the economic consequences.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But that's not the explanation we've been waiting for, and we're not waiting for it.
Precisely because it requires sacrifice and payment.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and compromising business and personal accounts.
Even a penny off the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), seemed so risky for the election to Zapatero that he quickly rejected it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet at no cost, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And treaties with the planet; this gentleman so useful to the campaign, who doesn't even speak, doesn't accuse, doesn't demand anything, but is a garnish for the meetings and a tender one.
As long as it's just a virtual contracting party and doesn't ask us to ride our bikes and cool off with a fan.
The mayor and the head of the Totana police are arrested on suspicion of corruption in the construction industry.
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of Totana, the "people's man" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the city council and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing construction crimes.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now located along with a number of police officers who have also appeared at the Construction Commission and the Municipal Industrial Land and Apartment Management Company.
These three arrests are in addition to six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid in an operation to reclaim more than 2 million hectares of farmland on land suitable for construction so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last election, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are being charged in a summary trial at the Totana City Court of First Instance.
The first six arrested were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
The other accused is his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate office registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as was Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a company belonging to that group through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is being conducted by the Crime Unit of the Civil Guard Central Operational Unit, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out 11 searches, mostly at firms related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area who could have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia town of Totana, which would consist of more than 5 000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a spa.
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of reclaimed land in Totana, and its project was to double the population of the town of 25,000.
Nuaria consists of Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is engaged in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
It happens
The first.
If you don't mind, we'll just skip the Book of the Month and maybe think of other awards and contests in the meantime.
I've got something in my head.
Guys, life is change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of Finland's leading newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book review also appeared:
"The content of the philosophy course has entered the public discourse in the wake of the tragedy at the Jokela school.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the education councillor responsible for philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in high schools".

A colleague reports on the criminalization of downloading from the Internet in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a single song would be a felony punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal a record in a shop for less than EUR 400, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1 000 in a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for withdrawal (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to get into a fight than to change compacts.
The rate for taking part in riots is from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for exchanging compacts would be from six months to two years
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of Article 107 (3) (c) TFEU.
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by the same penalty as the provision of pornographic material to minors (§186).
So unless my colleague is wrong, someone's got a hand out, and a real hand out.
4th
My attending puts me one of his articles on weird research called "Money causes brain activation, especially when others get less".
Or the feelings that a monthly salary evokes in employees depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph, and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernad Weber, study author and head of the Neurocognosy Display Group at the Life& Brain Institute in Germany, "The greatest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly".
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but when one was given twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don't really know if that conclusion required that much science.
The applicant from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Hague Court of Justice.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Karlin List' (2006, not shown in Spain), takes its title. It follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, in the style of a detective thriller, in pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressuring the relevant states to close the net.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, is a considerable expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a model car.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurer and the policyholder.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract which stipulates that the insurer will receive an agreed sum of insurance for taking responsibility for the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies base their rates on statistics, so the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
Similarly, insurance companies have concluded from their audits that married people have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the trips, the more likely they are.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the premium.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the insurance that best suits his policyholder profile.
We'll show you the most important variables for choosing a type of insurance that not only suits the type of policyholder but is also reasonably priced.
People under 25 face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and short driving licenses, when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
While all-risk insurance is ideal for good coverage, there are cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with a discounted premium to get all-risk coverage at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the client's participation in the payment of the insurance event.
'The part of the insurance premium that the client will pay will be fixed in advance in the price of the insurance, which will be the higher the lower the participation,' explains Luis Noguera, CEO of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Alternatively, the insurance is extended to other road users, so that the customer is insured against damage caused to other persons but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire, and loss of the vehicle.
I have a recommendation.
If you are under 25, try to be alert and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, a malus is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonus and the malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance because the client's risk index decreases with experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to take out an insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot use their previous experience at the time of an accident, even when driving", says the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "fear of the newbie" has been overcome.
If the client is married but has no children, it is better to take out an insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the customers with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a premium discount (which could be EUR 300) or, with a high bonus, an insurance extended to other road users, starting in the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"They drive more quietly and have a higher purchasing power, so they can afford the luxury of getting the best discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to take out an all-risk insurance with a discount on the premium (of EUR 150) or an insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is true that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident but also because it is a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly consider the insurance options that would best suit our personal circumstances.
Celtic are trying to get a point against AC Milan, which means the quarter-finals.
AC Milan and Celtic will face off at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday in a bid to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as for Italy it would mean being first and for Scotland it would decide the place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured their fifth game's lead with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points but need one more to ensure they don't get ahead of six-pointed Shakhtar, who will play Benfica, who have four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will be making their first appearance on the 13th in the semi-final, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be drawn before the others and a draw at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems the most likely, even if both teams try to fight for the win, because the Italians won't want to play at home and Celtic know that if they win they will be first and secure a better place in the last eight.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Shakhtar doesn't win, but they can't count on that because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1) but won the first match (2:0).
And so AC Milan's players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots who believe they can reach the semi-finals of the reorganized Champions League for the second time just as they beat them in the same match in the last competition with Kaká's goal in extra time (1:0) after a 0-0 draw in the first half.
The only hope for the Rossoneri is Shakhtar, who only cares if Celtic lose, both to advance to the last eight and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and without the possibility of continuing in Europe's top competition, could reach third place with one win and thus play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, to 20,000 people for their first tour since their break-up in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that their group's reunion was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video that tells the story of the band, which made a splash in the late 1990s.
The comeback and world tour coincide with the release of their new album, released in Spain by EMI, which features a selection of their main hits, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The Spice Girls 5 appeared on stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the crowd that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria had forbidden him to do so a few days earlier.
Before the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the five-piece band to disband two years later, also expressed her nervousness in a press conference two hours before the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that world opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I did", Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So, at first, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines.
They were waiting at the airport for the army to bring them in.
The fifth has seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He's playing in Madrid on December 23.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
The ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
'Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.'
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused Gazprom to cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which led to a sharp rise in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
"the NHS must check foreign workers"
The auditor said the Scottish NHS Chambers needed to improve criminal records checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from the head of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the Glasgow airport attacks in June.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have a clear picture of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were all fine on a sample of five health authorities.
The head of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel recruited from outside the European Economic Area immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the main terminal building door.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court via video link accused of being linked to the attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to screen foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK before they are hired.
Although Disclosure Scotland is used by the Scottish Health Commission to check criminal records, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the committees should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with audits in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly", the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS was in many ways in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the numbers of foreign staff is available".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value these reminders will bring", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority has announced that it currently has 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the head of the Supreme Control Office warned that the figures were likely to be higher also because the commissions had trouble identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely being implemented.
They included passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidelines on pre-employment checks for foreign NHS workers.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
She also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the health boards, would consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment control guidelines for all staff - including foreigners - which she plans to issue next month.
Joy Division has taken over the movie awards.
Control, a biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
Also receiving awards were star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and Toby Kebell in a supporting role.
Lady Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for bringing British film to the world stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division up until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - the soundtrack of which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for best direction and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London thriller The Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British cinema.
This 50-something, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming his next Indiana Jones film, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the Camelot and Harry Potter films, Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors for people like me", he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored".
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are given by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for membership in a cell preparing an imminent attack on an oil facility as well as on clerics and security forces.
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter said one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been waging a campaign against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Television reports said that a cell of eight militants led by a foreign national was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction unit to defend facilities from an unsuccessful al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal ministry statement: 18 of the arrested were from a cell led by a "missile launching expert" who had slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 of the detainees were accused of plotting the murder of clerics and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis view as heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family, which controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls from Saudi al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces over the past... five months", an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested for promoting "takfiri thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that encourages violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
The arrest also included 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the orbiting European space station show that the planet is even more like Earth's wayward twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus was in conditions similar to Earth's and could have been habitable.
But the frightening greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and the lower rotation rate sent Venus down a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it's being ravaged by hurricane-force storms and winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sober view of how the earth might evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus began like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago".
Police have seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still up to date
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and passed them on to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28th were as funny as Snow White asking Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time around reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's election.
It's unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the debate's sponsors, selected the clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time spent on a single topic, was on immigration.
This is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard something pleasant: the anchorman recorded peaks of approval when candidates spoke of a tough approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views was between Rudy Giuliani, the leading statewide candidate, and Mr. Romney, who has pushed ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to discredit a man who, like the mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two fought particularly fiercely when the interviewer asked if either candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Second-place candidates like Duncan Hunter, Congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, have been able to throw their weight behind the issue.
Neither of these two has a chance at the nomination, but both of them are staying in the game, perhaps because they started raising the alarm about immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates are pretty much on the same page: more border controls, no tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with concerns about poisoned toys from China and other concerns about the world around us, helps Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate got very awkward when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun ownership in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani went on to say that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn't believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another inquirer asked if Jesus would support capital punishment.
Mike Huckabee - who is now, against all odds, number one in a recent Iowa poll because of his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is uncomfortable but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would accept, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, which earned him ridicule.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa is overshadowed by his recent success in fundraising and Ron Paul's loud cheering at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back from the bottom as both wings of the party still cannot agree on more prominent and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with a victory message of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has found another trap he might fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it's a common practice in British political scandals, this one isn't particularly spicy.
There doesn't appear to be any orders sold, no bills mysteriously paid at a Paris hotel, no extramarital fingers sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown could get away with it without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman had been masking contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under other people's names for four years, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being phrased as the increasingly witty Liberal Democrat deputy chairman, the once feared Mr. Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the troubled Northern Rock Bank showed weakness in management and poor judgment under fire.
The poorly thought-out tax code amendments have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data on 25 million people exposed unimaginable administrative malpractice.
Three retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending, claiming that being a commander in the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now, here are the multifaceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably headed for his end.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point where they find it difficult to govern.
People don't trust and dislike politicians, but they usually shake their suspicions when a new gang takes over.
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office for long, this disengagement is gone: the administration becomes a hole, ministers start doing briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes distracted and defensive.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot be the new broomstick to other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the Treasury Department's records are linked to decisions that Mr. Brown made as Treasury Secretary.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in the Blair trouble, like the long investigation into political party funding caused by "value for money", voters can safely assume he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
These rags aren't as horrible as the conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was misled.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, stable and mildly brutal government.
The recent political gifts scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't his.
The laws against anonymity of large political donors are clear and they exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might be buying access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of Mr Abrahams's actions but did not know they were illegal, will certainly be questioned thoroughly; as will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour fundraiser who learned of the sleazy donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these frauds, even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He was quick to condemn the violation of the law by his own party, but he softened his resolve by resorting to a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, like find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one in six months, and move forward with a real reform of party funding.
It would require Labour, who are in distress, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a committed party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is through unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally start to move around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is in decline, predators have turned their attention to the credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses if secondary mortgages were to infect other forms of consumer credit could reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
Increasing cases of insolvency (with more than 30 days' delay in payment) and write-offs (accounts deemed unenforceable by the provider).
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer lending market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it's too early to panic.
The number of accounts written off and insolvencies is still low.
According to Moody's, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3,89% was almost a full percentage point below average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in US personal bankruptcy laws led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders have worsened.
The sector also has a good repayment rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And confidence in securities backed by credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways for the spread of infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when mortgages on real estate dry up, consumers are more likely to go into debt with credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than the value of collateral, so falling house prices may not necessarily mean a change in the creditworthiness of lenders.
They may even be advantageous to the lender.
Consumers' incentives to pay down mortgages decrease when their assets fall below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the list of priority repayments.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more volatile conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or borrowing limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid price changes in the underlying items.
"We don't have to reevaluate all our loans one fine morning", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime mortgage-style explosion is low, the risk of a gradual impairment is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt relief push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their roles in a fraud linked to former Enron financial executive Andrew Fastow changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, allegedly involving Fastow in a financial fraud in 2000 -- enrichment at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was front page news for two years, during which the issuance proceedings were ongoing.
In the United States, their case is one of the unresolved parts of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who have earned the nickname "The NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud along with Fastow and his former chief deputy, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a series of Enron scams that pushed Enron into a spiral toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three British people knew it was actually worth a lot.
The company Kopper controlled bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The bankers accused paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its interest in this Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and the others.
The bankers were awarded $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others were awarded approximately $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three British nationals were free on $1 million bail ordering them to remain in the United States for the forthcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, over $60 billion in market value and over $2 billion in retirement benefits.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's helplessness
The price of a Gulfstream G550 jet, powered by a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But for some of the richest Russians, it's a small change.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many seats because it's for a close family member or a corporate president".
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Show, a four-day orgy of lavish consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury vendors set up stalls hoping to lure newly rich Russians to everything from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-encrusted car doors that would make 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was carefully looking for a bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
"It's a nice car, but we're up against fifths and tens", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private jets after the United States".
Oil waves are pouring money into Russia's capital just like they did in Dallas's heyday.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980's when some Americans got very rich and went to Europe, where they were looked at as materialists", said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spendthrift of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spendthrift.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference drew Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion, according to Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people.
In addition, the local headquarters of the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union, which found that there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, with a combined net worth of $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing manager at London jeweller David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All the women are flawlessly dressed and the men are each worth a fortune".
While walking through the halls on Sunday evening in evening gowns, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and Svetlana Turovtsova, five years her senior, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes or Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who was clad in designer clothes like a red-carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home run.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the freshly rich, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit for hours in traffic to walk around a warehouse that is a screaming mix of Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables, Dubai suites, Gund plushes and showers.
Members of the general public could purchase tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a reproduction of Rembrandt's life-size, hand-painted blue tile painting.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the gold".
Indeed, local vendors say that Russians with old money (about 10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Yet, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries, or ordinary tourists, flooded the fairgrounds every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local general manager of King Koil Bed, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere and cotton mattresses, interwoven with gold threads, for $70,000.
On the very first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, a company that provides high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car customizer, said he sold three car grilles in the style of chain-link bracelets for a Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner, which had a knitting needle coated in Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich skin wheels or a cubic zirconia portrait of his wife doesn't have to ride them yet", Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll store them in his garage 30 to 40 cars away".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" doesn't mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the huge increase in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company set up four British-style red phone booths filled with a column of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passersby stopped to toss around piles of cash, or to let friends take pictures of them on their cell phones, relaxing in the midst of the surplus wealth, or just to pocket a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire", Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a botched surgery .
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the local restaurant A Little Healthier and watched the ambulance arrive at a white New England house two blocks down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon a patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the coroner's van arrive", said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant inspector.
"In that moment, I knew someone was dead".
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died as a result of an operation performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity police declined to release, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of Miss Arroy's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a wave of mourning through the Newark police department.
Ms. Arroy had been assistant to the Chief of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September of 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and hardworking", Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me".
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroy, a former Newark police officer who works for the Commission on Alcoholic Beverage Control, and that she leaves behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroy died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the possibilities", said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
Authorities said they arrived at the house at approximately 3:00 p.m. on the 21st.
They found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still have little to say about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had interviewed Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in the front yard and a dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door leading to the basement, in an open garage, there was a blue barrel with the words "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hoods on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Miss Arroy provided invaluable assistance in dealing with the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or that one,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
The hope of the Fed cutting interest rates is driving global stock markets to strengthen
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Fed will try to ease borrowing conditions by further cutting interest rates were bolstered by reassuring statements from the Fed's vice chairman.
Stocks jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman, said regulators must be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to continued pressure on financial markets.
In an apparent attempt to calm the agitated markets amid signs of a revival in lending efforts, Mr Kohn said that recent excitement had 'partially reversed some improvements in market performance towards the end of September and October'.
It further stated that if increased volatility persists, the possibility of further deterioration of financial conditions for households and firms will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver fresh capital injections into U.S. markets and perhaps further interest rate cuts to stabilize lending conditions.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy as home sales hit record lows in October.
The impact of the financial whirlpool was underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost-cutting effort to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bid to provide substandard housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be eliminated in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index strengthened 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 Index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips up more than £39 billion.
The German Dax rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Recently, credit tensions on the markets were at their peak after the European Central Bank auctioned three-monthly banknotes to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB in releasing surplus money to London's money markets has increased as Libor, the UK's three-month interbank lending rate, rose to its highest since late September after rising steadily since 12 November, at 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be England's number six batsman this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the broader context of no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make that decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who is holding down the job on loan at best, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to help with decision-making and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the England manager, is starting to fill with applications for the national selector's job, albeit not necessarily full-time.
He who is not placed sixth on the batting order will be unhappy, but life is often unfair, let alone sport.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession while someone else never gets past the bottom, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket that selection is difficult and requires judgment, which ultimately must always be subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to the Shah if he is?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and industry background, should be promoted to the board -- there's only one spot.
Who's to say what level is right for a cricketer when he can't get a chance to go down or swim to the next one?
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decision making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer needs to catch the captain's eye at the right moment to take a wicket, and a batsman needs regular chances in the starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
It's more complicated to capture the gaze of the collector.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like a marksman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first-class cricket at 33 runs apiece.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on the same low average, but both had their moments at the top level and hope for more.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara may be a matter of opinion.
The choice may or may not have a big impact on both of your careers.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and had a good first-class performance, five wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was fighting for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer who, moreover, although he scored two hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underrated.
It's more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today's practice at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
Speaking for Shah, his sparkling and valuable Test debuts at 88 in Mumbai and 32 first-class centuries against six Bopar, who, at 22, is seven years his junior and has an excellent record against spin bowls.
However, Shah made just ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in a Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and this, coupled with the immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan tried to replace him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken away from the momentum that was so evident in Mumbai.
But Essex University has a joie de vivre in the bones.
He is fearless on the cricket field and his off-field behaviour is symbolized by the recent overturned four-wheel drive car on the show day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and apparently shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching from a distance, to exclaim, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better on the field, his medium-fast slip throws on the home court seem to suit him, he delivers effectively and he fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm leaning towards Bopara getting his chance now, which is not to say Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets suggest, he's the one who's playing here next weekend.
Buses are bringing refugees back to work and fighting al-Qaeda.
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, unloading refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some even returned to fight the armed groups that had driven them from their homes.
The Mansoura bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who were returning by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to cease fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amarya district, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariah called him to say that local civil defense, backed by the US military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who was driven from his home in Sleikhah, north of Baghdad, by a shell attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that they were running a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleek and that they needed me and my boys to support them.
That's why I came back today", said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of calm in the capital after the increased US military presence and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who defend their neighborhood with arms in hand alongside the US military.
But more than that, it said they were being driven back by visa bottlenecks and a lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced a suspicion shared by the refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraq's sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis so they would have to go back to Iraq", said a Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left".
Part of the reason for the decrease in violence is that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which has eased tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland, good education
Germany's smallest state is a leader in vocational education, even excelling in the internationalisation of its universities.
In only one area of education, Saarland is as concerned about the deficit as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French", this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland to mark the 50th anniversary of this smallest state.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) education monitoring.
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can graduate with a double or even triple degree.
This is corresponding to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saracens are admitted to university - many without a high school diploma.
"Saarland uses a vocational education system", says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
With more than one in five young people eligible for vocational education, Saarland is over 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, Saarland offers ample opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities for studying two subjects are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practical education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore now ordered universities to launch a promotion campaign for engineering courses.
"After the first Pisa study, we have implemented several reforms in the general education schools", says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
To help children start learning as early as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model adopted by other federal states.
If the students' performance improves significantly, it will be revealed in future comparative studies.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of at-risk pupils fell from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not improve as much as other Länder.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of Saarland, the Pisa studies do not compare foreign language skills - otherwise, Saarland could score in this area.
The neighbours' language is compulsory in high schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez moves the clock
Soon, the clocks in Venezuela will be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will move the clock in this South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chavez is becoming a laughing stock.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the new law will move clocks minus four and a half hours ahead of world time.
The South American country will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, explained his decision by saying that the United States had imposed a time zone on the world.
On Wednesday, Chavez announced he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage situation.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't anymore because of my self-respect", said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reforms that the citizens of the oil-rich nation must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
This reform would significantly strengthen Chavez's power in the country.
The controversy was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages.
Uribe, by his decision, "spit in the face" of Venezuela, he criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile phone ringing has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas?" - a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
It was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so angered by the left-wing populist's loud remarks at a recent Ibero-American summit that he silenced him.
German workers face lower wages in 2007
German workers are forecast to face a decline in real wages this year despite a strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 people in employment can realistically expect to receive less than last year.
"The blame lies with small wage increases, higher value-added taxes and higher food and energy prices", said Bild newspaper editor Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3,3% for the new year is right and reasonable in this situation.
But the Federal Employment Agency should not fall into such a predicament again, to have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, the newspaper quoted the social democratic politician as saying.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices has pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3% year on year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought, and the European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is glowing.
Now, the European probe Venus Express has provided evidence - electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere have been detected, and lightning strikes on Venus fly from cloud to cloud at a height of about 35 miles [56 km], wrote Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the theory of primordial matter, lightning could have created life on Earth, and storms were said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
This was not the case on Venus: "If life ever existed, it must have been a long time ago", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, the surface of Venus would be barely habitable, with an atmosphere about 100 times denser than Earth's and temperatures sometimes reaching over 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it is a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve so differently is the fundamental question of ESA's mission.
Since no probe has been launched solely to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, summarized in several articles in the journal Nature, highlighted more than the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earthlike than previously thought", Esa said.
In addition to the winds already known at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that is spinning much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost as massive as Earth and is almost as big, at 12,000 miles [12,100 km] in diameter.
This planet, called the Morning or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates much more slowly on its own axis, and one day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus is not as hot as Earth at 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit [460°C] and 92 bar [90°C] below the surface, scientists believe that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, but on Earth it remained in the oceans while on Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Kohler demands an end to party disputes in view of the Dalai Lama's acceptance into the chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after their meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls for a grand coalition to end the feud over the Dalai Lama's accession.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue", Köhler told the business newspaper Handelsblatt.
He also expressed his understanding for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to host the Dalai Lama in September.
"While I respect cultural differences, for me human rights are universal", Köhler said.
While the German president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not stop him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's acceptance and has been attacked by the coalition for this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the "pre-emptive" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the Dalai Lama took office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is trying to secede from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that broke out in France
Street fights with police, gun battles, cars on fire, Wolfgang Schaeuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France.
We must do everything to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
Barricades are burning, rioters are shooting at police with shotguns, and after serious youth riots in France, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) is worried about a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful not to let the same social tension erupt into violence.
We have to take it seriously", he told the Hanoverian newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapidly changing realities of society.
The federal government, the Länder and the municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
And that doesn't just mean integrating immigrants.
"Since the integration summit, we have seen the first progress after the conference on Islam".
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, youths and police have been engaged in violent street fights in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were burning in Toulouse.
The German government's greater integration efforts were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against "the imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
In particular, it is necessary to provide more study opportunities.
"We must give young people hope", stressed Mr. Kolat.
The mayor of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is more social control over families.
In addition, many youths from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we must be careful", he urged.
We must "early enable young people to enter the workforce and to get an education".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were on duty and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and several burned garbage cans and cars.
As of yesterday, there are approximately 1,000 law enforcement personnel on duty.
Police will continue to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after visiting the suburbs.
In the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, riots swept through Toulouse.
The disorder was sparked by a car accident on Sunday that killed two teenagers.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the teenagers.
In the Kingdom of the Clouded Angels
The Chancellor's outreach to the real world documents that the coalition is at its programmatic end and that we can expect nothing more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her dismal, indifferent-sounding and poorly-contact speech at the General Debate of the Bundestag, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she is supposed to govern.
When Angela Merkel was criticized for focusing too much on foreign policy, she once responded with a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
She has shown in the House of Commons how much she deserves to be blamed.
Merkel was not even feeling any real interest, let alone a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "The Cloud" was introduced: a politician who stands out, who flees into foreign policy and even there, she speaks only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And, in fact, such a flattery - such an immodesty the CDU chairman would have forgiven two years ago.
Now she's limited to empty phrases that might increase her popularity with people.
This approach damages her image as a pragmatist who doesn't need flattery because she solves problems.
But in the realm of the Cloud Angels, internal political issues are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
She has a few more lines to say on these topics.
It's remarkable how often Merkel overstates her words when it comes to child support.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times to get at least part of the sentence right.
Once things get too concrete, he trips into completely foreign territory.
The attack department.
The Republican presidential debate on YouTube has turned into a heated debate for the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident on the first issue.
Mitt Romney is presenting his opponent Rudy Giuliani with a claim that he has turned New York into a "refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with a sharp rebuke: "I think his own house was one of those sanctuaries", he replies, and he presents to the former governor of Massachusetts that he had privately employed undocumented immigrants.
With the Republican base still without a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
A half-minute video, recorded by Internet users and uploaded to YouTube, is only used as such a clue to a key topic.
"It was precisely this policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to seize power", John McCain puts to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one to advocate an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain is not sparing his regrets, nor is Romney for refusing to condemn a torturous interrogation method called "waterboarding", which involves simulated heating.
Reactions from the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the campaign's major themes are neither the war in Iraq nor torture.
The audience erupts in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
It'll show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong then", Romney explains bitterly, asking the party base and television audience for forgiveness for supporting abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian
The day after he stepped down as army chief, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parvez Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday, keeping him in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and work for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post of Supreme Commander of the Army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting him to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, a former general is reigning as civilian head of state for the first time.
By resigning as commander in chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's highest court, which appointed Musharraf's lawyers after the state of emergency was declared in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area.
The army spokesman said the bomb went off on a road near the Afghan border.
Father Krautrock is back
The famous German band from the 70s is playing again, three members of Harmonia have taken up their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already much better known abroad.
The sensation is then announced by the performance of three seated gentlemen who at first appear to be merely enjoying their dinner.
Everyone has a box in front of them, cables and, most importantly, buttons.
63-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt is sitting in the middle.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, leaning focused over the synthesizers, is seen from the audience on the right.
Everybody contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by accident, they become a traditional piece.
It doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen musicians too much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of Harmonia has caused considerable excitement.
One thing to note here is that the repeated questions showed that while the name is part of the collective pop consciousness, it is definitely not familiar enough for someone to miss this band for 23 years.
But why can't the German celebrate his still-living legends from the '70s?
And especially when the music style, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Cologne-based Can band's last members the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, the room was filled with curious eyes from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their performances, the audience's amazement was unbounded.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
It's hard to remember Harmonia, a trio that only existed for two years and even then was far from the influence that others later credited them with.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They first played in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly assisted Kraftwerk, but he did not become famous until he was the guitarist for Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forest, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was more like living in some kind of Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the artwork is said to derive from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a trash can.
Harmony kept a lot of it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the next one was called "De Luxe".
Despite their quiet and humble sound, the band was struggling financially.
Gathering hay wasn't just about self-knowledge.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly cut from a concert in Griessen in front of a record-setting small audience of barely 50 people.
Rothera expressed the wish that the members of Harmony would get together and practice occasionally.
To Roedl and Moebius, that was a totally rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their split.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster came back to life in the '80s and since then, they've been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can thank Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label, Grönland, set out to promote krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Neu! was considered Roedeley's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in Berlin's House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
We're going to have a Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also attending.
This is a picture of the overall breadth of krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's line, accompanied by the strangest sounds, hovers in the room: "The only true music, it belongs to the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in a peasant's sitting room.
The legend is also helped along by the projection of other black-and-white photographs of a set of devices with wildly interconnected cables.
Until then, the three veterans are back to improvising.
No more gluing microphones to organs and drums to eliminate the never-before-heard, homemade tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the immersion technique, punchers.
The choir of the House of World Cultures doesn't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, he whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place he sings emphatically "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Rather than blues, we would have found roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "'68!" at this point is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be disturbed even now.
Even the most obvious thing on the stage is thought through.
Where does the music start and end?
This question either makes a person nervous or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
The release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden saw the release of two films about the war in the Balkans.
But none of them are convincing.
The movie's templates either place too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too emotional.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop that from happening in The Hunting Party.
Good news first: war criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the grim background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
We've lost sight of this most beautiful man of the '80s recently, not only because he played a lot of nice, light-hearted parts in all the cool women's movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences perpetually on the subject of Buddhism, you're gonna want to see another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party.
Gere's magical performance, his war correspondent Simon Hunt, is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful: a man whose best years are long gone, but who as a ruined monument still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits theaters this week, is just another in a never-ending string of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that the Serbs are not portrayed as the cause of all evil, this TV shallow movie turns too soon into a shootout and action.
The movie will be very similar to Cobra 11, with no highway, but with war.
The Hunting Party provides a vivid exploration of why no really good film has been made about the Balkan wars.
The story of three American war reporters posing as a "fox", a Serbian war criminal, could perhaps become the next "Apocalypse" in another era, under the direction of a different director and writer (both Richard Shepard here).
The two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that the military can't, but their journey turns into a madness.
One of the reasons The Hunting Party failed is that Simon Hunt is not the sullen, sentimental cynic portrayed at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft would prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be written off once and for all after the reporters in the last five fast-paced minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA and all the world's crime hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminals and leave them to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking, it's worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
But this film has a deeply human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are exceptionally united here) of not pursuing the persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of Brecht's famous poem.
It is about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion on the leaky veins on my forehead, noting: how tiring it is to be evil".
Movies like The Hunting Party have these exact same puffy heads, but they do suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of the war in the Balkans.
It was in this paper recently that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were huge flops.
To that I can add only one thing: There has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always true: when a star wanders through a crisis zone or walks through a minefield, it creates a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Frontier of the Break with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it would be decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film - Schindler's List.
Many films must be mature - films now considered Vietnamese classics - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now", or "The Tin Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces back then.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder in our home is instantly on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
And the writers don't have the skill to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To Be or Not to Be" and "The Great Dictator" were so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to develop a sarcastically measured artistic outlook like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel Lemprièr's Dictionary and The Balkan Wars, he said: "The only similarity is that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is getting criticism for canceling the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has drawn sharp criticism from politics and economics.
Many want to continue the fight to organize water games.
But von Beust encourages realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently inspired the city as much as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this high level of political enthusiasm".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project but to create a new long-term concept for it "based on a revised timetable".
Mayor Ole von Beust stuck to his earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association that will decide on the Olympic candidacy", von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference for us means that with a timeline of 2028 we have no realistic chance".
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's comments deplorable.
It seems that Hamburg is not going to bid to host the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to ruin our chances by calling plans buried at this early stage", HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To withdraw the application would be contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Olympics as a replacement for hosting the Olympics.
The university athletic association only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD group in the Hamburg Senate has blamed the government for wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was held back by the Senate for years because it was committed to hosting the Olympics and excluding housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook still planned the Olympics with the whole area later to be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg were a source of great excitement.
But the hamburger was wrecked in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol boxes.
When you associate Sweden with a wooden box, you're not thinking of Andy Warhol, you're thinking of Ike.
Or is it?
The wooden boxes currently being made in Sweden cast a dark shadow over Warhol's list of works.
Most of the 94 Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" on his list are fakes.
After Swedish newspaper Expressen expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes" a few months ago, an internal research at Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a disappointing result; the six "Brillo boxes" donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most other Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" in circulation on the international art market.
The events leading up to it are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-blue design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet in 1968 featured - with Warhol's permission - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes, which did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
They weren't artworks, they were models, just exhibits.
Warhol also apparently gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo cases to be made in Sweden, but these are not on display at Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now speak of 15 boxes that rightly went down in art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" labeled Stockholm Type.
Some of them have been auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 about 100 cases were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol was three years old.
Lars Byström, chief curator of Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after their plywood panels were painted with the base paint and polished, were painted with an oil white paint brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that the paint was applied directly to the plywood by a painter's roll without any prior base paint - and that it was acrylic, not oil.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list", said Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies"."
Back in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address the "key allegations" made in the case of the soapbox.
But the organization has remained relentlessly silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, entrenched in a Manila hotel, demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denies responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government attacked the hotel earlier with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had entrenched themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Government troops have sealed off the area around the hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales has condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough", said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers, said other military units would soon join the march.
Critics of the government have called for a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
The Manila financial district was the main scene of a rebellion by some 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the uprising collapsed in less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatile
United Internet has secured more than a 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now holds 20,05% of the share capital.
There was previous speculation about a takeover.
The company still considers the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versailles.
United Internet announced that it was taking this step to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%, speculation about entry emerged on Wednesday.
The financial market says that this money institution only holds shares for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold a further 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to acquire the competitor Freenet, the companies have jointly set up an SME joint venture.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies are currently satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet and will not exercise their right to acquire the remaining 18.49% of the business.
It is considered that the companies are keeping all options open for the time being, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and opaque Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile network customers and 1,27 million full or DSL customers at the end of the third quarter.
Holding United Internet and Drillische had previously held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it's been agreed that Drillisch will get another 4%.
The right to buy 18,49% of Vatas was agreed in August.
