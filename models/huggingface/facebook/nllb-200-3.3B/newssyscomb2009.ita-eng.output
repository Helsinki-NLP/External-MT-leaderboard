The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: 29% of the total
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the grand coalition and the marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to preliminary results, to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the elected leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärnten sub-prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country is still the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but it lost 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the postwar Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the Volks, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the Volkspartei had a considerable advantage in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters have obviously punished them for bringing down the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary party leadership meeting.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
The Social Democrats, however, were concerned about the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the FPÖ gained 18% and the BZÖ 11% of the vote - but the Social Democrats also expressed concern about another year, 1999, when the populists joined the popular parties in the collective government (the FPÖ was still united, but in 2005 it split from the BZÖ), which was even the reason for sanctions by the European Union.
This is clearly the case for Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens also entered Parliament, but fell slightly, dropping from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly passed the 4% threshold and not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal beetle harvesting in India is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that this will lead to a cooling of relations between the two countries.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it was not resolved, then there would be a certain cooling off", he said after the meeting, which was convened on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive branch can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved", said the Minister.
Mukherjee believes that Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, should appeal to a higher court.
Then you can apply for bail and wait for the verdict in the open.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Magistrate Court then it will be possible to obtain a pardon", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support was already being provided by the Indian side.
"It is in our best interests to maintain the best relations that have been handed down for many years to India.
The Indians admit it too", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The Minister avoided answering the question whether he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
"I have obtained relatively many promises", he simply stated.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
Approach the electronic map on the wall that shows Australia and adjacent marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent but in a small dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The zone is as big as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the UNO's Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the Czech lawyer and director of the division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
The will to work and enthusiasm prevail.
The seabed still conceals a little-known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal ores and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The deepest part of the land
The coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
According to the UN convention, they are using the laws they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is particularly the case for the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the State in question.
The convention gives him exclusive rights to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a nutshell, the term continental shelf refers to that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparation.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful", Mikulka adds.
Australia's recent success in expanding its marine possessions has had a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also gained -- the area of seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, is about 1.6 square kilometres, so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profits from the seabed, as they promise, will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years from the moment the Montego Bay Convention was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends is where the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention has declared to be the common heritage of mankind.'
No state has a unique position here.
The right to extract in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike", says Director Mikulka, "because its individual parts are legally defined and their regimes are contractually established".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc in the framework of the common organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991, the company, like investors from a few other countries, acquired the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" under the convention.
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is frayed, it's a near-submarine replica of the Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on a total area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in polymetallic aggregates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", explains another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division, Rober Sandev, is bringing a relic to show.
It looks like a small potato or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the hostage release .
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to free the hostages  experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more details are being released about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages who were kidnapped.
The rescue operation, as reported by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, involved German special units.
In addition to army specialists, GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Bureau and the technical institution's logistics experts were present on the spot.
As the ministry spokesman reported on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, seeing the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the German offer of help, to join in as aid directly on the spot.
"We were lucky to not get there", says a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September, a group of travellers were kidnapped in southern Egypt by attackers: five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions.
After being kidnapped in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained a secret until the end, as did the details of the release or the possible ransom payments.
The freedmen have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't elaborate on the details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and special forces are to fly on an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the US Congress just failed to pass a $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones has fallen.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial-market bailout.
Despite appeals from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties there had been no majority for the program, which would have contained the chaos of the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the deputies to the consensus, even though the plan was unpopular.
It's hard to have gratitude to avoid something that hasn't happened yet.
During the voting period, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state bailout could fail.
It was restored before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the bankruptcy, it collapsed again.
Experts now expect more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to come into effect, it needs to have the approval of both the House and the Senate.
Promoters are seeing increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it's going to be a good winter for German tour operators:
One study shows that the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire to travel among Germans remains strong, according to a survey.
The German tourism association DRV reported on Monday that bookings for the winter season had seen a 31% increase in turnover compared with the same period last year.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
The surplus of travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would therefore amount to approximately 11%, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results are the figures from GfK, which analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and produces statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakening of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly in demand, DRV reported.
The increase in bookings would be about one third.
The German people would also be particularly interested in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in Germany.
The price of all-inclusive travel is particularly high, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs of energy and foodstuffs, the costs would be better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday.
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also reported to have been very good, with a surplus of bookings again compared to the previous year - although according to a further study the number of Germans who had travelled was down on the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, a pint of beer from the mouths and VIPs in dirndl drawers.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde TV hostess and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But we have one thing in common: three minutes into the Wiesn, the photographers are already shooting at us and taking pictures until the cameras are full of pictures. Very flattering, and this was my first visit to the Wiesn.
That 's how you make friends .
The dirndl of two dollars seems to be getting its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the equator of the white sausage, the sense of well-being in the costume/suit to this day still remains in the limits.
And once you get to Theresienwiese, it's not that serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed  everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's apron is getting weird looks at the banana-chocolate stand.
A nun pointed out that I had tied the apron wrong: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow".
I'm gonna sneak up on you from the back left.
All right", he says and laughs.
Others make little waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, bearing the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretching their bare buttocks against an uninvited one.
The boy with the exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
She finds it "gorgeous", with a strung "ooooo".
This one tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter earlier.
Right next to one of these fire hydrants, which everyone thinks is a dumpster.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbiesler" guys.
Others are not so fortunate as to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m., the health workers, who have to take care of the poor beggars, swarm on the party square.
The nurses always appear in groups - always 4 at a time, dragging a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like most visitors to Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever's lying under the curtain in this blood alcohol coffin, you can't tell.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the paramedics shouted at me and disappeared into the crowd.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died soon after.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving after the crash.
He's been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands astride the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking out over the world like some German provincial town halls.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling to the vault, there is no doubt as to the grandeur of the undertaking of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of this railway that ran from Damascus, to Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions were dashed by World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The isolation of the region from the surrounding region, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has been overcome by the
British and Dominion forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for the Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly falling into disrepair, largely overtaken by history.
But today, this railway junction to Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the ever-larger diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the ice-boundary of the Cold War, is over.
There's a new engagement policy now.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy run down the slopes that produced the old-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has suggested some suspects in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art stone and steel facility - built on purpose - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping malls and power bakeries, where business suit managers - both men and women - meet to do deals early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Full suit, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its nearest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one or the other.
It has to be both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey", he says, "does not want to face that choice".
He then makes a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited from memory: that the links of the Middle East, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically ride those rail lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions may now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called the "sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating land.
Remembered lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21s, but by the time Proteus sang its final song in 1979, many of us were in our 20s - we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to tackle whatever the music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to be knighted, a conductor would be Vernon Handley.
I got to know him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have seen more than 100 of his concerts and can honestly say that I have never disagreed with a single one of them - and many times been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "rid around the world on one or two well-known war horses".
So many of us will miss him.
I 'm not sure .
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed his study of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a bachelor of science, a bachelor of letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I'm supporting the exhibition of José Vicente Resino's 'Flamenco y vida' because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have caught my attention for their simplicity and power, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resin is able to capture magical moments".
Second round of the Honda supermarket .
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
While the previous model was already highly habitable, this new minivan has even more interior space.
Added to this is a refined mechanical design that increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution. This is the way it is.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically very similar to the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is worth noting that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation entered the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model in 2007, the estimates for 2009 are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8000 Jazz since 2002, corresponding to 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell about 2,000 Jazz units over the course of a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will enable Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain to a considerable extent.
In fact, the company's executives expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decline of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
Moreover, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do that, Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
The company's Insight is a five-door hybrid compact car - 14 feet long - that the Japanese company hopes to sell some 200,000 a year worldwide.
In terms of markets, and according to the Japanese producer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, with the remainder being divided between the European Community and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 12 feet [3.90 m] (an additional two inches [5.1 cm]), its width is 6 feet 9 inches [1.69 m] (an additional two inches [2.6 cm]) and its circumference is 8 feet [2.50 m], an increase of two inches [5 cm].
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living space inside is also enlarged.
This advantage is due to the new platform and the central position of the fuel tank, which was also introduced in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage compartment with a double backrest increases to 399 litres, or 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the dimensions of the 1.4 engine version, and that the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Moreover, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with a 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engine.
Both engines incorporate i-VTEC technology, which reduces fuel consumption, reduces carbon dioxide emissions, optimises mechanics and at the same time maintains high torque throughout the engine.
The 1.2-litre model allows for a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The  engine - which in the earlier Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now there are 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
In developing technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has drawn inspiration from nature, and in particular from bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees as an example, can avoid accidents.
It's the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision-avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technology Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the four-area Safety Shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer's vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the safety shield of the Nissan.
But the most important thing is the bees' compound eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly uninterruptedly into its own space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they call a laser range finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C within a radius of two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent the collision.
"Once it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning its wheels at a right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it were not so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and chief engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction its wheels can turn and not by exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the memorization of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can run without interruption and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes".
It's the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision avoidance, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination by avoiding obstacles along the way.
Trembling before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, besides having a lot of capital to intervene, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to keep Americans from engaging in junk mortgages in banks that are in doubt of default, they created a fun and educational game for net users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel" or the "trouble".
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to make you think not once, but twice or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
The information provided by the game is certainly useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more a teenage site than a mainstream site.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a room to sing in the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house isn't even a...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it had signed an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, to invest nine billion dollars in a 21% stake in the company, following a sharp fall in its shares on the stock market.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at a cost of $25.25 each, or a sum equivalent to $3 billion.
The price set is 19% below the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds at a conversion price of USD 31,25 with a 10% yield.
Morgan Stanley said that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of USD 29 per share, or 28% below its current price.
However, by 5 p.m., the Morgan Stanley stock was down 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a bank holding company", explained John Mack, the American group's managing director.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its stock while still coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious stance than they have taken previously.
The details of the deal, which were revealed on Monday, also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: 'We thought our share would be made up of ordinary shares only.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain the Morgan Stanley shares at a price 7% below their book value.
The transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.'
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares within one year if, over a given period, the latter are traded at more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "significantly" eased its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a test for the group, which has seen its stock price fall by half while the cost of its risk insurance has skyrocketed.
The price of oil rose on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito, the other day.
To found the republic on a socialism appropriate to the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who voiced the draft of a new constitution.
This is because, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% voted 'no' and 0.7% voted 'no'.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, he would need to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a landslide victory for the "yes" vote, with between 63% and 70% of the vote.
Rafael Correa had claimed victory for his draft constitution on the night between Sunday and Monday.
"The Constitution has triumphed gloriously", he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As usual, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was conducted calmly by the Organization of American States (OAS) election observation mission, was based on a 444-point text that consolidated the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently from their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants greater power to the head of state, who will be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and will have the ability to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and re-nominate himself for a new term in February 2009.
The constitution also states that health and education services are free, which the president has started to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who had been held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, at around 15:30 on board a special plane.
They were immediately taken by helicopter, without any press interviews, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for further tests.
They are in "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the hijackers", said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was tossed from hiding place to hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists  five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian  and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organising agency.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were shootings, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled", said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "lampo" were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
The European Union is also calling for the immediate release of the hostages and for the immediate release of the hostages.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, the special forces", he said, without adding further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army patrol claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two of them.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim that was immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture, which is the focus of the current election campaign.
That's good.
But some aspects of our cultural life are always in the shadows.
Who will speak out against the meager sums given to the starving little museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting heritage monuments and buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have any real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
Among our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that heritage itself must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies for the safeguarding of historical heritage, genealogy, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of desperation when real estate developers and decision-makers attack our forgotten ruins and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will history and heritage be given their due space?
Benelux governments to nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries have helped the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to fall into difficulties as a result of the crisis in the American credit market, by partially nationalising it. The three countries will provide 11.2 billion euro to the financial and insurance institution, with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands reached an agreement at the highest level over the weekend, involving the president of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for competition.
The first major crisis in the eurozone in the context of the difficulties which have been affecting the international financial market for more than a year was the one affecting Fortis Bank, and in a certain sense the decisions taken in this regard can be seen as setting a precedent.
The decision taken on Sunday night means that all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's shares in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' shares started with a vertical collapse, and the second half of the week saw the institution's serious signs of crisis.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to fail.
The bank's stock fell nearly 12 percent on Friday, the lowest in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
The total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion at current share prices, but according to the bank's management this is not real.
The summit blamed the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the headline slowly began to rise again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy bid.
The Belgian Government had previously assured investors that they should not fear losing their money.
The bank's customers were not panicked, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches and has also acquired leasing companies.
The Fox in the Chicken House
Life and health insurers in America, based on people's purchase of medication data, often refuse to take out an insurance policy.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become unmanageable.
'There is a privacy programme under which the use of prescription data for medicines is in any case subject to the consent of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like handing the chicken to the fox", writes the Washington Post, quoting Richard Dick, author of the program to follow prescriptions.
Insurance companies base the insurance premium and the amount of compensation due in the event of an accident on the state of health of the potential customer and do not insure if they consider the risk too high.
In the past, the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the result of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper process 10 years ago: based on the customer's ID code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines you have bought in the last year and a half and from this the program can tell you what diseases you suffer from and what health conditions you are in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, this means that the level of fat in your blood is practically unhealthily high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are various versions of the programme on the market, some of which also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not have much left over, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the contraindications is that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are used against migraine or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance and commercial policy, is a risk-increasing factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have not yet imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies are also now processing lab test results and linking them to medication consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate privacy law but it only applies to health care and insurance.
There's a bill before Congress that gives the authorities the power to regulate data-driven companies.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links the forwarding of data with the consent expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot deny the approval because otherwise the insurers do not stipulate the contract.
So in the end the hens are left to the mercy of the fox.
French, French, Italian, Italian
EU and India double trade
As the EU and India are partners trading mainly with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this issue, along with all the other global issues.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power that should be given a greater voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
The European Union has to be able to take action to combat the spread of this disease.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the EU's President-in-Office, and Commission President Barroso and Javier Solana, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade to €100 billion over five years.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a result, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements have been legally unified, so that air traffic can also be started in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to strike a balance because while the EU is India's largest trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth amongst EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The European Council also called for the establishment of a European Union-wide dialogue with the countries of the region, and for the establishment of a European Union-wide dialogue with the countries of the region.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round trade talks, even though both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it is committed to its energy and climate agenda, which aims to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees with this, and that a global pact should be drawn up at the climate conference scheduled for next year and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French firms will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros to build the Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our news agency, the deal is for 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
The Italian publishers were very present at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to occupy the 171,790 square metres of the fair, with more than 403,000 titles on display and Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion. Italy will be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
The data show that the share of books by foreign authors in total Italian production, and in particular of books for adults and children, is decreasing.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the desert of Nevada.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high hill in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said in a press conference that the plane had been located, a team had been sent, and now it was confirmed that it was the one that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.
The sheriff's office has confirmed that no human remains have been found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the wreckage was discovered and identified the aircraft as the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search was called off a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had made his mark on history by a long line of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a solo circumnavigation of the world in a balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he was flying around the world nonstop.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
An SUV that's off the charts with an original design and well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, the GLC is the latest of the compact off-road vehicles of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
The launch of the new GLC SUV, which will be available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
The hype surrounding the new car's debut will be a new form of communication, including a futuristic 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posters, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture, you'd think the car was off the billboard.
Later, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLC will be illuminated in all its details at different times, before being combined into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will this formula be able to pique the interest of future buyers?
That 's what Italian hooligans are .
The Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that the whole of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the National Blue Team for years and that, to be honest, had never created too many problems.
He'd never been in a fight with the other fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have been added grouplets (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the militants' home towns appear: Saturday night they were removed so they can't be identified.
They're inspired by the English typhus.
In Bulgaria they found a Nazi fan club, Levski's.
Figc had made 144 tickets for the match available to Italian fans: all in the name of the player, so they could be easily checked.
And the Viminale had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four supporters of the Blues, who had a record of stadium offences, had been refused their tickets and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the files that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international crime that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all of Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not going to set foot in a stadium again.
Thankfully.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, that those who are just over 150 will be joined by others.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way", they argue from Viminale.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the National team game on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory is meeting, on Tuesday the Casms, which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce chorus and the stretched arm during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the Trieste's Quaestor where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to sing to the Duce, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatory's number one, "crimes must be attributed to the country in which they occur.
This group has been in line until now, but we will now look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling in the hymn of Mameli: that's not a crime either, but if you'll excuse me, it's not polite... "
