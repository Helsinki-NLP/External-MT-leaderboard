Between 1 January and 15 March 2020, the rate of the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom increased rapidly.
The Index of Increased Infections of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/Trans-European Trade Border Countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 epidemic is increasing rapidly in all countries, with varying degrees of severity depending on the country.
Based on the experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 infected patients requiring healthcare, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in a mass outbreak of the disease.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus pathogen, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are associated with pneumonia, either as a symptom of pneumonia or as a mild respiratory infection, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed to a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases experienced severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we will examine and evaluate the potential COVID-19 outbreak situations in the European Union/Trans-European Trade Border (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) by country and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current cases of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom with the number of current cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other sub-regions, and the rest of the world has seen a surge in COVID-19 outbreaks.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first case of COVID-19 in Europeans was confirmed in the WHO definition of outbreaks, according to the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. medical journal.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were detected in France on 24 January 2020, and they were all returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in 30 countries in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the same date, and 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
Obtaining the recidivism index of COVID-19 cases and the number of outbreaks
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the COVID-19 case count collections from official sources such as the country's health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO daily at 8:00 a.m.
This information was used to assess the prospective COVID-19 situation in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare the situation in their respective countries with the situation in Italy.
As a sample of the current cases of COVID-19, we calculated the prevalence index of COVID-19 cases in the seven EU/EEA countries and the UK for a total of 14 days or more between 1 January and 15 March 2020, which we will consider as the standard case of COVID-19.
We also show the number of reported cases by country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 compared to the number of reported cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day surge rates of COVID-19 cases in countries in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom are generally similar to those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Covering all of the EU/EEA and the UK, the COVID-19 recidivism rate began to rise around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (in a supplementary note).
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, which showed a similar increase in the rate of COVID-19 cases in all countries in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (follow-up data).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The report highlighted that in less than three weeks, 15 other countries in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom had reported a total number of cases at 8:00 am on 15 March, comparable to the number of cases in Italy.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is rising rapidly.
The observed COVID-19 prevalence trends suggest that the epidemic is increasing at the same rate in all countries.
National public health responses in countries are at different levels, under different circumstances, and continue despite differences from country to country in the procedures for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including outbreak definitions and combination testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum patient capacity.
Data are available for only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 population in hospitals and/or intensive care units at the EU/EEA level (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to strengthen existing data surveillance that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that the number of beds for intensive care and intermittent care in Europe varied significantly from country to country, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that they may have both more and less resources than Italy (which had 12.5 ICU and Medium ICU beds per 100,000 in 2010-11).
The modelled outlook conditions associated with overcrowding of healthcare facilities are included in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment, with the predictions of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 infections associated with a risk of over 90% of the number of intensive care beds in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Since the disease is concentrated within certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are normally only able to treat a specific local population, information on outbreaks and number of ICU beds should be made available through the Nomenclature Level 2 (NUTS-2) of the Local Unit Names System for statistical data.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to manage local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to respond to increased healthcare needs, especially in the case of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care, such as the outbreaks in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in a recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, predictive and comprehensive approach to disease prevention is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, as well as a shift from a containment to mitigation approach.A sharp, expected increase in patient numbers may result in insufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand and respond appropriately to the disease situation if no prior preparation is made.
Rapid risk assessments also describe public health measures that can help reduce the impact of the outbreak.
There is a short-term opportunity for countries to further scale up their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this is not successful, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, creating a human pandemic.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted by bats and may have caused similar symptoms through a similar organ pool.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less lethal than SARS, but it spreads more rapidly, infecting more men than young people, older people and women than men.
In response to the rapid increase in literature on the emerging disease, this article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive review of rapidly evolving research topics.
We will work to cover all aspects of epidemiology, causation, virus studies, diagnosis, treatment, diagnosis and prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this review will increase awareness and understanding of this threatening disease and help eradicate it.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, was an unforgettable experience for all Chinese citizens who were told to stay indoors during the holiday season and for weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection.
The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its strong similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the related disease CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 discharges from hospitals, and more than 3,000 deaths.
COVID-19 is the WHO's public enemy number one and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), the first report investigating the chain of transmission of the virus was published on 7 January 2020, after isolating several patients, and in the two months since, more than 200 papers related to COVID-19 have been published on the study of the virus, epidemiology, causation, diagnosis and treatment.
This review attempts to summarize the research that is being done on this rapidly evolving new field of content.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, including Middle East respiratory illness (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss everything we know so far about prevention and disease prediction, as well as some of the remaining pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally harmless pathogens to humans, primarily causing an estimated 15% of the common cold stage 4.
However, this century, we have seen two cases of high pathogenicity CoVs in humans: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originated in (China) in 2003 and (Saudi Arabia) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and soon spread to other countries with alarming infection and mortality rates.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is thus the third outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a mass outbreak of cold pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported to the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV's follow-up status was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the outbreak has spread rapidly to cities, states and countries bordering the border.
On January 20, health workers were reported to have been infected, and it was concluded that the infection could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the government of Wuhan suspended all public transportation and locked down the city.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease found that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases (21 of which were confirmed) had been from contact with a Wuhan seafood market, the origin of the disease, which is thought to have originated from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
The situation is changing and the extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
The most recent full information on the outbreak is available at the following link, from a multi-center study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of February 11, 2020. (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA)
SARS-CoV-2 is infectious at any age, but is most commonly found in people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half of the infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, with very few cases among those under 20 years old, and only 14 cases among those under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more common in males (0.27/100,000) than females (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in large numbers mainly in and around Hubei province.
The average duration of COVID-19 from onset to diagnosis is 5 days (2-9 days).
The average duration of labor was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset of symptoms to death is 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The basic reproducibility number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI, 3.51-4.05) and the conditionally modified R0 is 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, the number of cases had increased several times, coinciding with the rush of mass transit vehicles ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the correspondingly adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk groups for COVID-19 are men, people aged 60 and older, and those with severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large single strand RNA-bound viruses that enclose DNA.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs can reproduce in humans.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the envelope spike (S) glycine protein is produced by the membrane fusion of its cell receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm: after viral RNA replacement, genetic RNA containing a membrane-bound glycoprotein and nucleoproteins is released into an infectious form containing plasma, which binds to the plasma membrane and releases the virus.
On 10 January 2020, the first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was discovered.
In 10 genome samples collected from the Hunan Seafood Market in Huanan, Wuhan, where the outbreak began, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new strain of beta-CoV with over 99.98% genetic compatibility.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV is genetically.
When viewed through an electron microscope, small particles of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in extremely thin sections of the surface membrane of a human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a host site for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 that binds to human ACE2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a short novel protein produced by orf3b and a cell-secreted form of the protein produced by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may be a viral pathogen and may inhibit IFNβ expression, but orf8 lacks a known domain or structure of action.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. presented the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 mixed with B0AT1, an amino acid transporter, at a resolution of 2.9 Å.
The closed-open structure of the complex is formed as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which can be considered evidence of CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may become a potential therapeutic target in drug trials to slow SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are known to have originated in bats and have been transmitted to humans through caterpillars and camels.
A comparison of the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs showed that the new virus was 96% identical to SARS-like CoVs found in bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, and that bats were assumed to be the source of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier and transmit to humans is still unknown, and the transmission pathway remains unclear.
Ji and others have suggested that snakes may be the carriers of the virus from bats to humans, since all mutations in the S protein have the same type.
A basic study found a 99% viral genome match between coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 in snail slides, suggesting that long-beaked, ant-eating mammal snails, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, may be potential intermediate hosts for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers in Guangzhou, China, said.
However, the 1% variation in prevalence in both bioreproductions is still a significant difference. Therefore, final analysis results for strong evidence are awaited (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a test tube in a dry environment for up to 48 hours at a temperature below 20 °C and a humidity of 40% to 50% for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heating at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, and is killed by antibiotics containing ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine, paracic acid, chlorophorin and other fatty solvents, whereas colloidal acids are not.
Generally, all humans lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore are not immune to the novel virus.
At this time, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been published.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Typically, after a virus has invaded a host, the host's primary immune system first recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus causes inflammation, which in turn limits the spread of the virus, while inducing the development of dendritic (immune) cells and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that accelerate the absorption of viral antibodies by phagocytic cells.
However, the N protein of the SARS-CoV virus can help the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, an adaptive immune response began to play a role in fighting the virus.
T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the immune response to MERS.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that fight the virus, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells that are infected with the virus.
T helper cells produce an inflammatory cytokine to help protect the cells.
However, CoVs can interfere with T cell functions by causing T cell death.
The body's immune system, which is also resistant to infections in the blood, including C3a, C5a and nutrients such as antibodies, is also essential in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovering patients have been shown to destroy MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system releases a free radical byproduct that can severely damage the lungs and internal organs, and in the most severe cases, can lead to multiple organ damage and even death.
In the form of a mass outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect pregnant women and older people with co-morbidities.
Typically, people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or have a weakened immune system are more likely to become infected than others.
(Wuhan) A study of 425 infected people in Wuhan estimates that the average onset of SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, with most cases between 3 and 7 days.
However, one study of 1,099 patients found that the average onset time was 3 days, with a potential onset time of 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the outbreak of 8,866 people showed that the recovery time was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is critical for health authorities to balance effective quarantine periods based on the most specific outbreak period, so as to prevent the spread of the virus from asymptomatic to infected individuals.
A protocol requires that people who have been in contact with or have been exposed to the virus be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the travel restrictions and quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main symptom often shown in the early stages of COVID-19 is illness, but it can also occur when accompanied by other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, sneezing, chest pain, nausea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or oxygen deprivation in the lungs and blood within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly develop severe respiratory symptoms, including hypertension, hyperacidosis of the digestive tract, and bleeding.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and patients with severe illness should be screened for viral infection early, even if no pulmonary abnormalities are detected.
A local epidemiological study conducted around the end of December 2019 reported that the percentage of symptomatic cases was 98% sickness, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea, and 8% of patients required a respirator.
Two recent studies have found similar conditions in a group of people who were infected by a family member and a non-asymptomatic person.
In comparison, a population study in 2012 also found that MERS-CoV patients had nausea (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them require a respirator, which is much more than COVID-19 patients, and is about the same as MERS, which is a higher life-threatening disease than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, nausea (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), shortness of breath (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20 to 25%) and sore throat (13 to 25%) were the main symptoms, and respirators were required for nearly 14% to 20% of patients.
The death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, compared to 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide on 14 February.
In comparison, in November 2002, deaths from SARS were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 found that 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases had a mortality rate.
An early study showed that the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95% certainty in the precision range (CI) 5.71-7.23, while the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality and R0 (average infection rate) is shown in Table 1.1.
According to the above figures, SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a lower mortality rate than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Mass transmission is usually within the same family, or from the same social gathering or from vehicles such as cruise ships.
Patients were those who had a history of travel within the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms or were residents of Wuhan or other outbreak areas, or had contact with infected or infected people.
However, people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who have been cured and discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, and the travel restrictions will be extended.
In the early stages, patients' white blood cell counts (especially reticulocytes) are normal or decreased.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte counts below 1×109/L, including white blood cell counts below 4×109/L, a subnormal low lymphocyte count and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase enzyme and the presence of the virus in the blood were found.
Some patients had elevated levels of myoglobin and liver and muscle enzymes, while most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell counts.
In severely infected patients, the blood levels of D-dimer, a metabolite of fibrin, are elevated and the number of reticulocytes in the white blood cells gradually decreases.
The most common features of chest X-rays of COVID-19 patients are abnormalities, which are characterized by shadows or bright areas like lumps on both sides of the lungs.
Patients often suffer from abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid buildup, and connective tissue growth can greatly impair the metabolic process.
Type-I and type-II lymphocytes malfunction, which can reduce the level of surface tension and increase surface tension, which can reduce lung dilation and cause rapid lung damage.
The worst chest X-ray results are therefore often the same as the most severe stage of the disease.
In a first-time diagnostic study of a patient who died of COVID-19 infection on February 18, 2020, pneumocytes in the lungs, hyaline membrane rupture, leukocytosis between blood vessel tissues, and lymphocytic tumors in the lungs were found to be consistent with viral infection pathology, ARDS, and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection process using a complementary DNA-forming enzyme and polymerase enzyme chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined reaction from RNA sample form is used as the main standard for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, the high rate of false positives may have accelerated the spread of the disease, and the use of medical technologies for diagnosis (no longer relying on a single RT-PCR) began in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has occurred in the detection of SARS.
Therefore, a combined study that includes a history, clinical findings, radiographic tests, and radiographic findings is essential and critical to effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group published a methodology for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR technology-based SHERLOCK method, which uses a dipstick submerged in a liquid for less than an hour without extensive use of measuring instruments and detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with concentrations ranging from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input).
Hopefully, if confirmed in clinical trials, the new technique will significantly improve responsiveness and comfort.
Because no novel coronavirus has been reported, doctors can provide targeted care to COVID-19 patients while simultaneously testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed to treat other coronavirus diseases, such as SARS-CoV virus, MERS-CoV virus, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2.2).
Treatments include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine treatments, and psychological support.
The study was conducted in the United States and Canada.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing with antibiotics and vaccines to produce the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs, but may also attack other internal organs that express ACE2 enzyme, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, to a lesser extent.
However, respiratory disorders and collapse are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important for alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and depending on the severity of the disease, it may include general oxygen therapy, high upper oxygen circulation, non-inert inhaler/exhaust, and inert mechanical assisted inhaler/exhaust.
Patients with severe respiratory syndrome are often given pulmonary auxiliary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique used to treat life-threatening heart disease and respiratory failure that involves temporarily interrupting the function of the modified heart and lungs and allowing the blood to circulate and receive oxygen with the help of an external machine.
In addition, maintaining electron balance is important for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and hypertension, as well as protecting the function of vital internal organs in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to be a result of immune system overreaction in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytoplasmic hyperplasia of a cell is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is caused by cytoplasmic breakdown events including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
The cytoplasmic breakdowns in these cells encourage immune cells to produce large amounts of free radical byproducts, which are a major cause of ARDS and other organ failure.
Suppression of immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids, tucilisumab and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat a disease called cytokine hypertrophy.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm (hyperproduction of cytokines) include modulation of T cell direct immune response, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF, inhibition of the JAK enzyme gene, suppression of cytokine cell signaling phase 4, and HDAC inhibitor drugs.
Steroids are widely used as an immunosuppressant in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high doses of steroids did not work for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially bone tissue death, which significantly affects prognosis.
However, for patients with severe COVID-19 illness, corticosteroid use is recommended in small doses and over a reasonable period of time.
So far, no effective antibiotic therapy has been approved.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir was shown to inhibit other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these findings, Gilead has provided the compound to China for combined testing of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and is very excited about the results.
In addition, baricetinb, interferon-alpha, lupinova/ritonavar, and ribavirin have been studied as potential therapies for patients with recent respiratory syndrome.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other severe reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between these treatments and other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
The study also found that the amount of plasma in the blood is about the same as the amount of antibodies in the blood.
The treatment has long been used to collect plasma from patients recovering from infection to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent infection from someone who has not yet been infected.
In fact, recovering patients often have extremely high levels of disease-fighting antibodies in their blood.
Immunosurgical antibodies are immune proteins produced by bi-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, to fight pathogens and other foreign invaders, and they recognize and directly break down different molecules from pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms eased, with a reduction in inflammation, a decrease in viral counts, and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific treatments are developed, the application for widespread use of the method requires testing and clarification to make it understandable.
In addition, the reporting of clinical outcomes should carefully consider some of the side effects associated with plasma.
For example, antibodies over-stimulate the immune response and therefore cause cytokine release syndrome, which can be toxic to the point of being life-threatening.
Blood levels of antibodies are usually low, and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat patients with severe illness.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibiotics fast enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is even more important and practical to isolate basal cells from recovering patients and test for effective antibodies to fight off the virus' essential proteins, or to identify the genetic code that makes effective antibodies.
This way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects depend on the combination of different ingredients that will be included in a formula, which will vary depending on the diagnosis of a disease, based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the most effective ingredients are still unknown, or there is uncertainty that makes it difficult to isolate and confirm such ingredients or their optimal combinations.
Recently, with no effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe cases.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), where 87% of their patients were treated with TCM, while the lowest recovery rate (13%) was observed in Hubei (Hubei), where TCM was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is only a rough comparison, as the assessment needs to take into account many other factors that influence the number of patients and the severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) monotherapy with combined WM and TCM treatments.
It was found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom recovery, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM + TCM combination group than in the WM monotherapy group.
Most encouragingly, the rate of symptom severity (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM monogroups (7.4% and 46.2% respectively), and the mortality rate was also lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM monogroups (8.8% and 39%).
However, larger, systematically controlled clinical trials of the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still pending on a large scale and in many centers.
It would also be interesting to uncover the unique nature of the mechanism of action and to clearly identify the effective components of TCM treatments or, if possible, co-use with it.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are often in a state of extreme panic over the highly contagious and potentially life-threatening disease, while those with travel restrictions may also experience feelings of frustration, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as sickness, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can increase anxiety and stress.
A variety of psychiatric disorders have been reported in the early stages of SARS infection, often including depression, anxiety, extreme panic attacks, hyperactivity, autism symptoms, hallucinations, and suicide attempts.
The procedures of contact tracing and travel restrictions and quarantines that are routinely implemented as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can increase public anxiety and make people feel guilty for infecting their families and friends, and for isolating and humiliating them as well.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, and those who have been exposed to them, as well as the general public who need help.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multi-stakeholder mental health teams, regular and clear communication of accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of high-tech electronics and applications to avoid close contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are essential to cutting the transmission pathway from animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts where pathogens thrive, and are as important as antiviral therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on S-protein to produce long-acting antibiotics and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines that have been modified from a live virus have been evaluated for SARS using animals.
However, until clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the life-threatening effects of these vaccines in older animals, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether these vaccines are effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission of the virus.
This is also possible, as SARS has been missing for more than 17 years and no new cases have been identified since then.
In contrast, sporadic outbreaks of measles and mass outbreaks of MERS have continued in the Middle East, and continuing outbreaks of the animal-to-human disease in the affected regions have spread the disease to other regions.
The MERS vaccination strategy was implemented using vaccines that contained inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits (a vaccine made using specific protein antibodies) and some vaccines that have been tested in animals.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for immunocompromised populations is an urgent and critical business task in controlling the current outbreak.
However, the time required for the development of a vaccine and the time required for the different mutations of CoVs (average 18 months) are long and there are challenges to overcome.
As a new disease, COVID-19 only begins to show its full path of transmission after infecting thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without developing any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with both severe morbidity and mortality in severely infected patients.
Therefore, healthcare agencies need to build a predictive model of disease status to prioritize treatment, especially in areas with limited resources.
Medical studies to date have shown that the following factors have an impact or correlation with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age has been the most important factor in assessing SARS status, and is valid for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, a study of 8,866 patients found that COVID-19 mainly infected people aged 30-65 years, with 47.7% of those patients over 50 years of age.
Patients requiring intensive care are generally in poor health, and complications are significantly more common in older adults (average age 66 compared to 51 years).It is recommended that age be considered as a factor in predicting outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more commonly transmitted in men than women (0.31/100,000 and 0.27/100,000, respectively), as noted above.
Outbreak conditions and subsequent complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to experience severe heart attack and arrhythmia.
Heart disease is also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-like cholangiectasis, which may cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and immunity are not mutually exclusive and can interact.
Abnormal radiological findings: CRP in blood indicates inflammation or severity of tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictor for disease status, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A link between COVID-19 severity, clinical diagnosis and CRP levels has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely distributed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
They are therefore a common symptom of liver or kidney failure.
Key symptoms: Chest X-rays and the progression of symptoms over time should be considered, among other factors, to predict the effects of COVID-19 and the potential for further new cases.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressant medications that are often used as a concomitant therapy to relieve severe inflammatory pain for infections.
Due to the high doses of corticosteroids widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which left them with lifelong disabilities and poor health.
Therefore, if necessary, low doses of steroids should be given to COVID-19 patients for a short period of time.
Emotional stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most patients experience extreme stress due to prolonged travel restrictions, as well as witnessing the death of close family members and friends and uncertainty about survival.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are crucial to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
To date, studies of populations in different regions and regions suggest that COVID-19 has different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.
In addition to penetrating the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also effectively penetrate the upper respiratory tract, causing infection in the same way as other common cold-causing CoVs, with mild or no symptoms in the early stages.
As a result, infected patients can spread large amounts of the virus during their early stages or during the mild phase of the disease, making it very difficult to control the disease.
However, SARS-CoV infection is thought to occur when patients are severely ill and are not contagious in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
In an effort to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, China is currently implementing best efforts, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and ongoing restrictions on movement involving virtually all residents.
These actions have significantly affected the country's economy and other sectors, but the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end in March, and the phase of relapse will last for 3-4 months.
The report also highlights the need for a global approach to climate change.
Paul Hunter and others predict that COVID-19, which is more contagious than SARS, may not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model that predicted the outcome of the pandemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways and throat cavities of patients who had been hospitalized more than two weeks prior to their recovery, suggesting that the newly discovered virus has a similar seasonal pattern to influenza.
However, there are signs of good prospects in China, with the number of new infections decreasing, and the current strategic actions are proving effective.
The number of Ebola cases was initially estimated to be up to one million, with half of those dying.
However, the disease can be controlled gradually by implementing strict travel restrictions and quarantine.
SARS-CoV-2 may become less infectious, as SARS-CoV, and eventually disappear, or it may evolve into a less co-existing viral disease in humans.
The following is a comparison of the prevalence of COVID-19 and the prevalence of SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with materials to which the virus has attached itself.
The virus has also been found in feces, creating a new possibility of fecal and hand-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 infections, including 17 co-infected individuals and 40 health care providers, found that 41% of infections were likely hospital-acquired.
Therefore, especially good preventive measures should be used to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and patients or even those who have been in contact with infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is masks.The use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series #1860) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks can prevent particles from a potentially infected person from spreading to the air and from adhering to surfaces and objects, which are ways in which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860) masks can protect against viral particles that are as small as 10 nanometers to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viral particles are infectious. SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with both viruses being about 85 nanometers in size.
The particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are bonded together, so healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should not use surgical masks but wear N95 (series #1860) masks.
Healthcare providers should wear appropriate protective clothing in addition to face masks to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask.The virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear face masks or glasses when treating patients.
Residents in infected or potentially infected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands frequently with disinfectant, stay indoors, try to limit movement and self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
In humans, a distance of three feet from a patient is considered an appropriate distance.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a novel virus for the human world, but a report dated January 7, 2020, found it to be highly compatible with SARS-CoV, alerting China to a state of emergency in the wake of a deep-seated reminder of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (Wuhan) reassured the public that the novel virus was not highly contagious and that restrictions on human-to-human transmission made it difficult to prevent and control the disease.
The message has significantly diluted public awareness, especially as the country prepares for the Spring Festival, and has missed this crucial moment in keeping the disease at a minimum in Wuhan.
The CDC in China will learn from this difficult lesson and make important advances in the future.
For example, these agencies should be more careful when making public statements, as (1) every word matters to the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) they should be more careful when receiving unusual and unique information from clinics rather than waiting for official statements from doctors or officials; (3) they should be more restrictive in controlling a potential outbreak from an early stage rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) they should publish more frequently and effectively practices aimed at increasing public awareness of outbreaks and regularly test the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months of writing, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the similarities between COVID-19 and SARS in symptoms make an outbreak of COVID-19 feel like a SARS resurgence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential in controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 is more common in older adults and in men than women, and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older people than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% and 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus from one another even if they do not show symptoms. In SARS, patients are usually infected when they have a severe fever. Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 influenza is more difficult to control than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A standard RNA test may show no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can be reinfected with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
The rapid growth in COVID-19 research has led to the following critical issues that need to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS CoVs from bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
The virus is transmitted from bats to humans, which is the so-called original host.
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the disease, and an outbreak can reoccur at any time.
Although many molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how specifically did the virus enter cells in the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not have access to fast, accurate diagnostics and effective treatment.
The epidemic is still raging, and the number of people who are infected with the virus is growing.
The virus is transmitted from person to person, but how does it mutate?
Could it become a pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur regularly like influenza?
While it is essential, it may take some time to get answers to the above question and many others.
But we have no choice if we want to stop the pandemic at any cost and get back to our normal lives as soon as possible.
The zoonotic origins of the human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have driven the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for many years.
It was not until 2003 that two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The widespread outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been a turning point in the explanation of how HCoV infection can be devastating and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China in late 2019 seems to have given a new boost to CoVs, surprising us with its high transmissibility but lower pathogenicity compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart.
HCoV infection is transmitted from animal to human, and understanding the animal origins of HCoVs will allow us to do a good job.
Most HCoVs originally transmitted from bat milk originally came from uninfected bats.
Intermediate receptors for some HCoVs are also known.
The detection of host animals is directly linked to the prevention of human disease.
Investigating CoV-receptor interactions in animals may also yield important insights into the cause of CoV outbreaks in humans.
In this review, we present a comprehensive knowledge review of seven existing HCoVs, with an emphasis on their research record as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and recombination of genetic material.
This article discusses the current COVID-19 pandemic.
It also highlights the requirements for successful host-to-host transmissions and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of coronaviruses that comprise a group of single-stranded RNA viruses with a protective co-reactive membrane.
These viruses are called CoVs because they have a crown-shaped appearance under the microscope and have the largest species of RNA viruses, between 26 and 32 kilobases.
Structurally, CoVs have unbranched genomes that share a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the biomaterial content consists of two large, overlapping, readable frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into duplicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are responsible for producing 16 structurally unrelated proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the structure of organically-containing ORFs consists of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A large number of gene-specific paralleter proteins are also encoded by different CoVs genes.
Based on their different protein sequence effects, CoVs are divided into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genus contains many HCoVs, and further divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Genetically analytical evidence shows that birds are major concentrations of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, while bats and rodents act as the genetic sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been subject to a series of species restrictions, and in some cases have emerged as a major cause of human outbreaks.
To date, there are seven known human-infected HCoVs (HCoVs).
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs pathogens.
Five other viral diseases have been included: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Infection with HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 causes mild symptoms such as a mild cold and/or diarrhea.
Compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, the virus is highly pathogenic and causes severe respiratory tract infections with a high incidence of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute pulmonary disease in many patients.
The first HCoV-229E strain B814 was isolated from the nasal mucus of a cold patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more has been learned through extensive studies on both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which can cause limited symptoms.
Indeed, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infections associated with HCoVs were generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that emerged in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing an estimated 10% deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak has resulted in a series of outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the rest of the world in isolation.
The HCoV (2019-nCoV) that emerged in 2019, later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the primary cause of the ongoing infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
As it turns out, the world is preparing for the coming SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Both of the seven HCoVs that can transmit from animals to humans were originally transmitted by bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Various evidence factors support the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from rabies, where viruses are well-compatible and show good genetic diversity but no pathogenicity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many huge medical, scientific, social and psychological challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs adds a framework for understanding natural history, including the dynamics and limitations of the evolution of the species.
It may also serve to identify hosts, guide or support hosts with moderate-to-advanced infection of SARS-CoV-2, and to provide critical engagement to prevent future infections.
In this review, we present the results of the animal-to-human transmission, interventions and infection of HCoVs.
Separately, we highlighted and discussed the common pattern of HCoVs with parent viruses that may cause disease after they are transmitted within species to a new host, but are not pathogenic to their natural hosts.
We also re-evaluated the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs, which is characterized by decreased outbreaks and increased transmission.
The consequences of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also discussed in this context.
The animal-transmitted CoVs pathogen has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E gene B814, due to nasal secretions from patients with a common cold, different CoVs were isolated in infected animals including chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection is presented in bi-periodic order (Table 1) to provide a comprehensive and knowledgeable overview.
The first HCoV-229E gene was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was later localized to live within WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibit symptoms of the common cold, including headache, runny nose, nausea and throat, and fever and cough, which occur in 10 to 20% of cases of infection.
HCoV-OC43 was isolated after 1967 from developing organ tissue and subsequent evolution in the brain of a mouse.
Test symptoms for HCoV-OC43 infection with HCoV-229E are similar and do not distinguish the symptoms of infection from other respiratory illnesses such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and transmitted mainly in winter during warm temperate climates.
The virus is usually active for less than a week and then becomes ill for about two weeks.
A test on human volunteers found mild mild cold symptoms in healthy people infected with HCoV-229E.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems developed severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as SARS pneumoniae, was the first well-documented outbreak of HCoV in human history, and the infectious agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS outbreak was in the Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002.
The SARS virus spread to countries and continents around the world, causing 774 deaths and 8,096 cases.
Except for those with extremely high rates of infection, an estimated two outbreaks per patient are expected within 4 to 7 days of the onset of the disease, with a peak viral infection estimated to occur on the 10th day after the illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV develop muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath and cough, and then develop symptoms of respiratory disease.
Hypoglycemia, liver function tests complications, and elevated enzymatic metabolism are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Widespread damage to small air sacs, the proliferation of epithelial cells on the lungs, and the proliferation of macrophages have also been observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require inpatient care and mechanical ventilation as follow-up.
It can infect a wide range of organs, including the lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, and is often accompanied by a severe cell mutation known as a cytokine storm, which can be fatal in people with severe disease, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a pulmonary biopsy of a patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been remarkable advances in HCoV detection.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in the Netherlands at the age of 7 months in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread in young children, the elderly and in immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 include diarrhea, eye spots, fever, and pneumonia.
Another independent study reported similar virus isolation from the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
The virus was first identified in the Netherlands, but has spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of all respiratory illnesses, with its peak incidence periods occurring during summer, spring, and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a severe case of throat disease known as a gray throat.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old patient hospitalized with pneumonia and respiratory pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma episiotomy exacerbations.
HCoV-HKU1, which is similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and causes mild respiratory illness, has been identified worldwide.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have become human-compatible and have low genetic susceptibility to causing more viral diseases in general, but a highly contagious variant of HCoV-NL63 has recently been identified in China, with a rare case involving an accidental infection, but the cause is unknown.
Generally, these HCoVs become less severe or pathogenic as they become more effective infectious and continuously present in humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old man with pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
In fact, most of the laboratory-confirmed infections originated in the Middle East, and cases of other sources of transmission, sometimes through close contact, have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another evolving outbreak of the virus occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The actual description of MERS, which is similar to SARS, is a severe pneumonia with a progressive symptomatic pattern.
Unlike SARS, many patients infected with MERS also developed severe renal impairment, which isolated MERS from diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of infected patients show symptoms of gastrointestinal inflammation such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed infections with a high mortality rate of 34.4% have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses known to humans.
A review of pneumonia cases linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, between mid-December and late 2019.
The World Health Organization has declared the recent outbreak of a respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern, also known as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a gross mortality rate of 3.4%.
In particular, in Hubei, China, the death rate is 4.2%, compared to 1.2% elsewhere.
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are a severe respiratory infection, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients have been found to have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly progress to a severe respiratory disease.
However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in terms of 82% of the genetic sequence of living cells, and they are grouped into different sub-branches of the tree of life.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been identified, which may contribute to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
The similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six other emerging HCoVs are very interesting.
First, the pathogenicity of the HCoV is very similar to that of the infection during the infection period.
According to this, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the symptomatic severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four most common human HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to exhibit symptoms common to human HCoVs infections, including asymptomatic or mild or asymptomatic outbreaks.
In other words, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen in SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs that are socially transmitted.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is high, at least as high as that of HCoVs in humans.
In other words, it remains to be seen whether the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased after infection in humans, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples.
Future clinical studies are needed to clarify whether or not oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in SARS-CoV transmission.
It is particularly interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in climatically-dependent conditions, such as HCoVs in social-mobility infections.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and containment after infection in humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs that are community-acquired cause mild symptoms and are well adapted to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be remnants of HCoVs from previous pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe human infection and people who have been severely infected with HCoVs have been rarely excluded.
To do this, HCoVs replicate in humans to allow for sufficient delay in the integration of adaptive mutants against the host-containing pathogen.
In this context, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 infection lasts, the more people it infects and the greater the chance of full adaptation to living humans.
Once it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop infections in living humans through isolation or other infection control measures.
For many years, community-acquired CoVs have been circulating among humans, causing colds in people with moderate immunity.
These viruses do not require host animals.
In comparison, the high incidence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well-compatible in humans and cannot control their transmission to humans.
They need to be contained and spread within the host animals, and they seek opportunities to infect vulnerable populations through one or more intermediates and host propagators.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human HCoVs.
It is currently as transmissible as the four human HCoVs in humans.
However, it is more transmissible than HCoVs that are acquired through social contact and less contagious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The virus is fully adapted to humans and continues to be transmitted from person to person without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it is recommended that HCoVs be discussed for their pathogenic evolution, nature, pathogenicity, intermediate and advanced stage interpretation and specific characteristics.
When an animal inherits a closely related ancestor with a high degree of shared similarity at the genetic sequencing level, it acts as a genetic evolution of a particular HCoV.
The ancient virus usually adapts well and is not contagious in this host.
Similarly, a host that has stored pathogens can carry HCoV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts were naturally infected and were either the natural host source of HCoVs or their original source viruses.
The difference is that if the HCoV starts as an intermediate host before it is transmitted to humans, it is generally infectious and does not adapt well to the new host.
This intermediate receptor can not only serve as a zoonotic source of human-to-human transmission, but also as a highly transmissible host that can temporarily multiply the virus and increase the rate of human-to-human transmission, thus causing infection to humans.
HCoVs can cause unexpected infection if they cannot contain their spread in the host medium.
On the other hand, HCoVs can survive even in the intermediate host, causing long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the average patient has a normal disease history.
Data on the spread and prevention of SARS show that historical records show that the first outbreak of SARS involved contact with game.
Follow-up diagnostics of outbreaks by blood tests suggest that animal traders have the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV antigen (SARS-CoV IgG) in comparison to the general population.
Paguma larvata and raccoon bears in the pet trade were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses, which are identical to SARS-CoV.
The incident is implicitly supported by the fact that no further news of the SARS outbreak emerged after all the caterpillars in the markets were killed.
However, it has been suggested that cat flies from the wild or on farms cannot be infected with SARS-CoV without exposure to live animal matter, and cat flies may function as a moderate-level pathogenic amplifier host rather than a natural co-host of SARS-CoV.
It cannot be ruled out that different animals, especially in markets in Guangzhou, have 80% antibodies against SARS-CoV, and that different small mammal species are likely to be direct hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up investigations for the natural zoonotic resistance of SARS-CoV revealed a close relationship between the bat CoV and the SARS-associated Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) in Chinese horse collar milk.
These larvae have antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV infection and share a similar genetic sequence to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of the same sequence of genetic basal cells as SARS-CoV.
These studies provided the basis for a new hypothesis that bats are hosts of pathogens that can cause disease in humans.
Various SARS infections, such as CoVs (SL-CoVs), have also been identified as being caused by bats, but have not been isolated as living viruses except for a specific WIV1.
Human hormone-containing structural transcription enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the pathogenic host for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is derived from bat samples and has been shown to be useful for cell-mediated immunity to bats, cat squid, and human ACE2.
Interestingly, SARS was also found to have a low degradation of WIV1 in the plasma of patients with Nalanta.
So far, WIV1 has been shown to be the closest relative to SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% genetic-based cell sequence similarity.
Despite the high genetic similarity between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that bats are not the direct hosts of SARS-CoV, just as WIV1 is not the parent virus of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic biology suggests that MERS-CoVs share the same genome as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Co-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are transmitted via the same receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme effects of MERS-CoV are closely related in terms of genomic analysis to those of the rabies beta-CoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of the genetic-based cell sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats are not likely to be direct hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, observations in the Middle East suggest that the camel strains of the strain are potentially infectious due to a deficiency of MERS-CoV-targeted antibodies, similar to the camel strains of Middle Eastern origin in various African countries.
MERS-CoV, which is identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nostrils of a single camel tick and further demonstrated that the ticks act as the actual disease-storing host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels that are generally infected with MERS-CoV in the test are generally asymptomatic, but have a high potential to transmit the virus through it.
Infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is the main route of virus release from bats.
However, MERS infections do not have a history of exposure to camel eggs prior to a severe outbreak, and questions remain about whether there is a plausible human-to-human transmission or an anonymous outbreak involving an unknown animal species that is infected with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% biochemical similarity to the CoV RaTG13 isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the consequential differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very good for determining how closely related the original source is.
Unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future, bats may not be related dependent hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
It is thought that the moderate animal susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 may lie between the slaughter of wildlife species in the Hunan seafood wholesale market and the early infections associated with COVID-19 and the occurrence of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on genetic research findings suggest that a small group of mammals known as potentially harmful maniscapers (Manis javanica) may also host the source beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This novel disc CoV genome shares 85-92% of the genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the living cell sequence.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 in the gene-based cell cycle and have about 90% of the characteristics.
They are grouped into two subfamilies of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the evolutionary tree, one of which is more similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence specificity.
Significantly, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differed more, but had a high degree of similarity in genomic sequence.
A preliminary study on infected plaques suggested that removal of viral overlap from lung samples translates into a similar relationship to SARS-CoV-2.
This study is a method of combining different data sources and attempts to make the human wound heal by producing a biochemical effect in approximately 86.3% of the viral genome.
The discovery also did not rule out the possibility of an intermediate animal host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, the difference in follow-up results between SARS-CoV-2 and platelet-derived SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs does not prove that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from platelet-derived parent virus.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 which are related to beta-CoVs.
Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in bats, squirrels and other mammals is needed.
The highest sequence genetic similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the S-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, share the highest sequence genetic similarity in terms of genome.
There is growing speculation that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the plaque SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs and the association of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective-resolution multiplexing.
A counter-argument favours a mutation between the beta-CoV associated with the SARS-CoV-2 scab and RaTG13 in the third wild species.
Mutation as a driving force in evolution is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The deciding factor remains the direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoVs with high viral transmission rates, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Genetic evidence suggests that the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodent animals, while HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E both may have been derived from bat CoVs.
A CoV, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), has been reported to be found in North American Trichinella, which has been shown to be close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was investigated in Ghana and is thought to have its intermediate host in camel colonies.
For clarity, current knowledge of animal origins of HCoVs, known as HCoVs, is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Bioevolutionary analyses have revealed evidence of historical interspecies transmission of HCoVs.
Around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory infection was documented when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and transmitted to humans from domestic animals.
The history of HCoV-229E's species-to-species transmission is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs, which are most closely related to HCoV-229E, have been identified.
Among them is alpha-CoV, a pathogen found in a type of camel-like hairy animal.
There is a variety of evidence of direct transmission from bats to humans.
In the shared ecosystem, humans may have been the first to come into contact with bats, not alpine bats.
Instead, humans have been in close contact with alpaca camels.
Second, the HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha-CoVs are distinct and pathogenic in bats, whereas the alpaca bat alpha-CoV causes respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV, a pathogen found in a type of hairy camel, is not found in wild animals.
For this reason, it cannot be ruled out that a camel-like furry animal could have transmitted the related HCoV-229E alpha-CoV to humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic viruses that can infect humans, including canine poliovirus, Ebola virus, near-virus, and the cankerworm virus.
It is therefore not very surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In other words, alpha-CoVs actually act as a genome of HCoV-229E, while camel coats and camel herds act as intermediate hosts for transmission from viruses to humans, specifically during MERS-CoV infections.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of cross-species transmission from bats to bats to humans, not just from bats to camels.
MERS-CoV, which evolved from bats, was identified as an early isolator and subsequent studies have shown it to be robust.
Bats apparently carry a wide variety of viruses that are highly susceptible to inter-species exchange of genetic fragments and inter-species transmission.
Longevity, close colonies, close predatory relationships, and strong flight are all conditions that make bats the preferred vector for the virus.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in the camel's back for decades.
The situation is well suited to camel stalls, which have been transformed from a direct disease storage site into a stable and naturally occurring disease storage site.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease in these animals and is controlled for low mutation rates.
Its rare transmission to humans is by accident, and the virus' transmission is uncontrollable, so humans remain the host that cannot spread to other hosts of MERS-CoV.
If anything, a comparison is made between the role of camel eggs in the transmission of MERS-CoV and the role of scab in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the plaque beta-CoVs pathogen causes high incidence of disease in plaques.
They may be endogenous hosts for SARS-CoV-associated cat-to-cat-ceds and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
Various potential causes of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered in future trials to determine whether to list or exclude them.
First, bats may be a potential host of SARS-CoV-2, a virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Living humans may share space with bats through killing bees or mining coal.
Second, the plaques may be the intermediate amplifier receptor that gave rise to the SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
People are infected with the virus through the sale and consumption of meat from their victims.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study of immunity among domestic and wild animals reinforced this.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from recombination and adaptation in a third species, which has been exposed to both bats and bats.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different animal hosts, three major roles on the viral side are also important in facilitating the crossing of species-specific barriers by CoVs.
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation during RNA replication.
Compared to single strand RNA viruses, the predicted mutation rate of CoVs can be defined as a moderate to high average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year, depending on the form of the CoV that is compatible with the novel receptors.
CoVs contain an enzyme called exoribonuclease, which can be read and modified, and its inhibition can cause a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, leading to a loss of weight or even a loss of life.
Interestingly, remdesivir has been shown to suppress the same strain of CoV through the restriction of this isotopy and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes.
Remdesivir is an experimentally developed drug that is the most promising candidate to fight SARS-CoV-2.
However, the mutation rate of the measles CoVs is about a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs do not adapt well to the carrier.
Compared to the highly mutated SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower and suggests a higher level of human compatibility.
The theory is that it could have been transmitted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also associated with MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to camel eggs.
Theoretically, mutations cannot cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to become ineffective so quickly.
Second, the RNA genome within CoVs makes them more susceptible to mutations and recombinations during genetic modification, thereby increasing the possibility of co-evolution between species, which in turn allows novel CoVs to emerge at a given time.
It is supported by a number of different open reading frames and protein processes that encode at the 3' end of the chromosome.
Third, CoVs change shape as and often as needed during RNA replication through a distinct copy-selectant component.
Fiber bias occurs during the copying of CoV RNA within a host that acts as a mixing vehicle.
The combination of high availability of end-to-end homology and recombination of genomic RNAs can lead to the emergence of new CoVs pathogens.
Evolutionary evidence of naturally occurring mutation synthesis has been found not only in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, but also in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The virus is also known to cause a number of diseases, including malaria.
In addition to the above three viral factors, the host's pathogenic location and viral interaction are other key factors that influence interspecies transmission.
In this context, the recombination of SARS-CoV is identified as a common example of evidence of selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on separate comparative analysis of human and cat SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoVs may be caused by mutations in the RBD of a specific S protein, with rapid homologation between different hosts.
In general, RBD interacts strongly selectively within the S protein of the CoV with the pathogenic receptor and the antibody receptor that protects against the disease, which are made up of cells.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present on the 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 subunit, which is the co-pathogenic site for human ACE2 as well as virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize a variety of ACE2 susceptible animals, including bats, caterpillars, rats and raccoons, which cause viral infection.
In fact, only six different amino acid residues from the virus, isolated in RBD from human and cat pepper, were investigated, four of which were located in the receptor that is closely related to the ACE2 receptor for interaction.
Cat's-eye SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T within its RBD, which may increase the ability of human ACE2 receptors to interact with the spike-containing (spike) protein.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial for disease adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares a cellular receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that its S protein may have mutated in its affinity for human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have shown a 10 to 20 times higher affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins than the combined affinity.
Other key sites are also of interest to determine whether or not they are needed for SARS-CoV-2 to spread.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but with a different S-component.
There are also several other HCoV pathogens, such as N-amino peptides for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be considered for the successful compatibility of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to the host cell, other factors and limitations that depend on the host also govern the outcome of interspecies infection of HCoVs.
Differences in protein receptivity between humans and natural HCoVs hosts such as bats, camels, and rats may play a role as a barrier to infection.
HCoVs need to take over host sites and break into restricted areas to successfully infect.
In this context, it is still necessary to selectively identify the molecular composition and characterization of the important virus in the host-interaction region.
Using the latest version of CRISPR to address host dependence and limitation issues for SARS-CoV-2 in unbiased genome-wide screening may be beneficial.
Emerging as new HCoVs: Going back to the roots
The variation in bat CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this view, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and mutation fusion also enable HCoV evolution, and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the storage or loss of genes that code for novel proteins has the potential to dramatically alter the appearance of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV sub-proteins, SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses have been isolated but have been found to encode different ORF8 proteins, suggesting that ORF8 is important in adaptation in humans.
29-gene-based cell-deleting features of SARS-CoVs have been found in variants isolated early in the human infection.
This deletion can be interpreted as a grouping of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and an adaptive mutation to a disease-storage transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages with a large number of smaller recombinant domains isolated within RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes.
The recombination sites can also be distinguished within components of nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak in a group of camels in Saudi Arabia shows that there have been cases of reincorporation among different lineages.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases have been identified in other HCoVs, and it has been found that HCoVs recombinate with other animal CoVs in their genes, which is not related to their structural structure.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause undesirable changes within the viral genomes, which may be caused by the relieving of the coercive selections that affect viruses such as the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype gene, which causes damage to two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 was found in bat and camel virus associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV showed a single-gene-based cell insert that caused the shift.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure within their host sites.
When CoVs were found in bats, only mild or no symptoms were identified, suggesting a possible interaction between CoVs and bats.
It showed that bats were well adapted to CoVs both physically and physically.
For example, in bats, defects in the stimulation of the inflammatory response effectively reduce the incidence of viral infections caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the increase in the receptor NKG2/CD94 against killer cells and by low levels of expression of the primary cellular adaptation group level I molecules.
In addition, highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the active metabolism of bats, which inhibits both CoV replication and exoribonuclease enzyme repair, and therefore selectively induce the production of highly pathogenic virus variants when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV variants can also evolve by recombination, leading to the storage of novel proteins or protein biomes for adaptation to the host.
So it's no accident that new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms in their host host host, such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly, without extracting the immune response of a strong host.
The mystery remains as to why the carriers of the disease show no symptoms and how the infection causes severe infections in infected humans.
Severe symptoms are caused by overactivation of the immune response and severe respiratory symptoms, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, there is a different immune response to the replication of CoVs during the absence of symptoms of disease transmission.
Immunoreceptor cutting, a common strategy that has been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 immunotherapy, may also be beneficial.
The immune response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, feeding type I interferon may be beneficial, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Also, the NLRP3 response in bats is imperfect.
For this reason, MCC950 and NLRP3 inhibitors may be useful during COVID-19 treatment.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been accompanied by a similar general pattern to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In fact, bat-beta-CoV has been found to have 95% biochemical similarity to SARS-CoV, and bat-beta-CoV has 96% biochemical similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, caterpillars and other animals on the market have been found to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, and no direct mediator hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Platelet beta-CoVs have been found to have significant genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that platelets may act as a medium-stage pathogen or that platelet beta-CoVs may contribute a part of the genome to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have re-emerged in the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal-borne infections and animal-borne HCoVs during human transmission.
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat-derived origin and are transmitted to humans through intermediate-level pathogens.
Closing markets for live fish and killing catfish could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak if it was assumed that SARS-CoV infection was caused by contact between humans and catfish in markets.
For the same reason, beta-CoVs, a family of coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-like coccus-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-
However, further studies remain to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through snails and other mammals and how it is transmitted.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in the body of a camel for a long time.
These camels are a major source of tourism and a major source of meat, milk, meat and spices for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is not possible to throw away all the camels in the fight to contain MERS, as was done during wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A broad approach to the effective development and development of MERS-CoV vaccines for camels should be taken in combination with other infection control measures to halt the frequent MERS infection.
These viruses are not yet eradicated and new genes can emerge that can spread the disease.
CoVs from different animals are circulating in the wild.
The potential for transmitting bat CoVs to humans, especially from animals, varies.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and mutate to produce new CoVs that are more infectious and/or lethal in humans in the future.
Some areas in China with a culture of wildlife eating should be closed to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the difficult tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on Earth.
They live in their natural habitat until they are allowed to leave their bodies.
However, although bats have many features that encourage the spread of the virus, humans can reduce exposure to bats and other wildlife species if they are aware of the need to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of living organisms is essential to better understand the ecological link between CoVs and their natural hosts, which may prove useful in preventing animal-to-human infection and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the spread of animal-borne viruses is for humans to stay away from the natural habitat of animal-borne viruses.
The origin of the animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains a mystery.
First, it is interesting to see if bats can transmit the source virus of SARS-CoV-2 to bats, under which conditions bats and bats share the same biological viability conditions.
The second is that if bats play a direct role in human transmission, we should investigate how humans transmit from bats.
The third is that if the third mammal is really a medium-sized host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and bats.
In conclusion, many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and should be monitored and tested for infection.
It is expected that in the future, SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus, whether it is a bat, squirrel or other mammal, will be isolated in its natural host.
Subsequent investigations will provide a clearer picture of the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for COVID-19 prevention and control in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be upgraded.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a strategic recommendation guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which contains our experience and provides a good reference for the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease and our awareness and understanding have gradually improved based on current research findings and experience in treatment practices. However, the methods for diagnosis and treatment are also continuously being updated.
This letter is in response to a comment about our guidelines and outlines the new diagnostic standard for suspected and confirmed cases according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 disease (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was discovered and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Our team wrote a guide to easy-to-understand recommendations for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection and published it online on February 6, 2020 in Army Medical Research.
The video has received a lot of attention since its release.
It is important to note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and understanding of the disease is continuously increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical industry experience, thus continuously improving diagnostic and treatment strategies.
The Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have been issued with a total of seven revisions, with some changes as of now.
The following is a summary of the guidelines for the use of the term "simple score" in the current guidelines:
Their efforts will add new evidence to our direction and will be a valuable reference in the fight against this global epidemic.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh review version) and guidelines studies.
According to the Seventh Amendment (March 3, 2020), in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, a broad diagnostic analysis to confirm a suspected case requires that either of the two clinical indications be combined or that one of the three clinical indications be consistent:
Outbreak history: (1) history of travel or residence to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of exposure to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days, or to people with illness or respiratory symptoms; (4) history of exposure to respiratory illness (such as exposure to a home, school, office, or other area) in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; and (2) history of exposure to respiratory illness in the last 2 days or less, such as exposure to a home, school, office, or other area where COVID-19 has been reported; (4) history of exposure to respiratory illness in the last 14 days, such as exposure to a school, school, or other area where respiratory illness has been reported; and (4) history of exposure to respiratory illness in the last 2 days.
Symptoms: (1) symptoms of illness and/or respiratory disease, (2) symptoms in the X-ray image of COVID-19 infection, (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of onset.
Confirmed cases should be based on the pathogen or suspected cause as described in the diagnostic test or on any evidence from plasma studies: (1) real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, (2) the entire viral reproductive sequence showed high similarity to the known novel coronavirus, (3) serum testing showed positive IgM for specific antibodies to IgG for specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, or negative for specific IgG for SARS-CoV-2, or a positive IgG mutation or elevation in recovery level above the critical stage of ≥4.
It appears that the real-time PCR test for the presence of nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) edits.
A blood sample for pathogen detection was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and evidence from plasma studies was added in the seventh edition.
These modifications contribute to the continued work of researchers to identify the most suitable nucleic acid detector for rapid diagnosis, as well as to the development of specific antibody results based on samples from the respiratory tract, which increase the availability of different samples, including blood samples.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that warns us to be cautious about patients with unique symptoms and those without.
Therefore, they should have edited the flow chart of Zhou et al. as they categorized people without clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The scoring system must also be validated by clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we would like to receive more direct evidence and comments from our readers.
We recommend that all suspected and confirmed cases be screened and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries.
We will update our guidelines in real time to help you.
Bangladesh has reported a daily high of five new COVID-19 deaths.
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the number of confirmed cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh included 114 patients undergoing treatment and 33 recovered and living at home.
The death toll was 17 in total.
In an online summary, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two patients were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital, where a hospital official told the local news agency Anadolu Agency that he was among the dead.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, said public transport would be closed until Saturday, longer than originally planned.
The lockdown on public transportation began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of basic items, medicine, fuel and food is still allowed.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were two people who returned from Italy on 8 March and the wife of one of them.
The three have been in good health since March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 has already passed one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection had exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The first confirmed case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia occurred on the same day, setting a new record.
On Thursday, North Korea said it was one of the few countries free of the coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours as of 4 April at 10 am (08:00 UTC) Central European Time.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 reported cases of coronavirus, which have been linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus infection in the United States reached more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday, CBS reports.
Around the world, countries have announced strict restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
On a national scale, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian citizens will be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the rest of the day, after previously only being in place between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand was planning to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the stay-at-home order in the state has been extended until May 1.
The Australian government has lowered the limit on the amount of toilet paper a person can buy in a store.
On Saturday and Sunday evening, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles restricted their supply of toilet paper to two packs and one pack per purchase at all stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a restriction on selling one pack per person.
The restrictions are posted on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of supply chains in the form of messages.
The company also said that it is now in the process of selling its products to the public, and that it is in the process of selling them to the public.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited its toilet paper purchases to one package per order for home delivery.
The change follows restrictions that Woolworths and Coles introduced on March 4 and 5 to sell only four packs of the fruit per purchase.
Coles reported in its March 8 news release that many stores selling only four items per person were still selling out within an hour of the arrival of the items, a demand it described as "unprecedented", but in a Facebook post, ALDI called the demand "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales have increased sharply in the past week.
The Cosco store in Canberra last week limited the allowable quantity to two.
To reduce inventory shortages, Coles ordered more from manufacturer suppliers and increased shipments several times. Woolworths took over ordering and ALDI also made early availability of goods for the Wednesday special schedule.
Russell Zinman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers wanted to increase their stock but local authorities were making it difficult to do so because of restrictions on the hours trucks can travel.
He said suppliers are struggling to keep up with demand and in rare cases, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday's special sale after the initial sales.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said grocery stores were filling up every night.
He noted that the shortage of toilet paper is a discomfort because it is a disposable item and only a small amount can be stored and when it is sold out, there is a huge amount of space left on the stage.
"We believe that if there is an abundance of items on the shelves at Coles and Woolworths, if products like toilet paper and detergent are available, and if there is a lot of them, you can minimize the threat", said Russell Zinman, ABC News's anchor.
Who Gives a Crap, a company that sells recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that it was running out of supplies.
Kimball Cork, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorben, are working hard 24 hours a day to keep supplies running, News.com.au reports.
The real estate website Domain.com has launched a new auction in Melbourne, where real estate agents are the first to offer free toilet paper to buyers for the long weekends of Labor Day.
The Thursday editions of the NT daily newspaper in Darwin include eight pages of paper intended to be cut into pieces for use as toilet paper.
ABC Australia reported on March 3 that stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on shoppers.
The demand for other products, including masks, detergents, dryers, hand sanitizers and flour, also increased, Zimmerman added.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Okado on Sunday limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 12 packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
The WHO has warned governments that the following urgent measures are needed:
Every country is still trying to change the course of this epidemic.
"If countries respond by detecting, testing, treating, isolating, tracking and mobilizing people", said WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are taking special care to both alert levels for the spread and the level of urgency and alert levels for inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in a CNN commentary in February that no other respiratory virus has been found to have a global outbreak of the virus except the smallpox.
Gabriela Szijjártó also shares the same view: "We have never seen an outbreak caused by coronavirus before".
He added: "We have never seen an epidemic where it is possible to control it".
Following the emergence of a new global pandemic, the WHO decided in January to declare a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said that the situation could get worse by the "baseline" of infectious diseases.
As of Thursday, AP News reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a sudden acute respiratory infection caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and declared an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in approximately 210 countries and territories, with an estimated 97,000 deaths.
The report also highlights the need for a global response to the pandemic.
The confirmed death rate is estimated to be around 4% in China, and globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
The following symptoms may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or cure that can eradicate the virus.
The main treatment approaches are symptom-based and adjunctive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth if coughing, keeping a distance from others, and self-isolation if suspected infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk management and closures.
The pandemic has caused a global socio-economic collapse, leading to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events.
Schools and universities have been closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
The spread of misinformation about the virus on the Internet has led to fears and discrimination against people of East and Southeast Asian descent and ethnicity, and Chinese, who live in the region where the virus has been most prevalent.
The report also highlights the importance of climate change in the global economy, and the importance of climate change in the global economy.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, reported a mass outbreak of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and began investigating in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to a Hunan Peninsula retail market, suggesting that the virus originated from an animal source.
The virus that causes the infection is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered strain of virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the squirrel coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The patient who was first diagnosed with symptoms was later reported to have developed a fever on 1 December 2019.He had no significant association with the raw material market that later led to the mass outbreak.
In December 2019, two-thirds of the first mass infections reported were market-related.
An unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 said that tracing an outbreak back to 17 November 2019, suggested that a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province may have been the first to be infected.While new cases in China have been declining significantly, Italy, Iran and South Korea have seen a sharp spike, with the number of new infections outside China surpassing the number of new infections in China for the first time, WHO announced on 26 February 2020.
The number of cases with mild symptoms may be significantly reduced from the case lists.
On 26 February, a small number of cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for less than 2.4% of the global cases.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population could be infected and herd immunity restored.
People who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed positive according to official procedures are referred to as infected.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have official policies against testing people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of January 23 remained undetected, and that those undetected infections were the source of infection for 79% of those infected.
A statistical analysis released on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The original estimate of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is 5.7 percent more likely.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with a typical onset of symptoms of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, there have been around 97,000 deaths from COVID-19.
As of 5 February, 80% of the deaths in China were over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official death lists from the COVID-19 epidemic generally refer to deaths that were tested positive for COVID-19 according to official procedures.
This does not include deaths that were not diagnosed, such as those in homes, nursing homes, etc. The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher.
Partial data from Italy showed that the number of deaths during the outbreak was four to five times higher than the actual deaths from COVID.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know the death toll is an overestimate". Overestimates are being made in the US and vague reporting also supports this claim. Such overestimations are common during pandemic times, such as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
Outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy had reported more than a dozen deaths by February 28.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica have reported deaths.
These figures vary over time by region and are influenced by a number of demographic factors, such as the number of tests, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, duration of infection, and age, gender, and overall condition. The death-to-case ratio is the number of deaths in a given time period divided by the number of confirmed cases.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-infection ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
Estimates of the outbreak-to-death ratio in China have declined from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1 January and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other estimates include the maximum case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of cases that have been tested positive and deaths from the disease, and the infection-to-death rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of cases that have been tested positive and deaths (whether diagnosed or not).
The figures are not data for a specific time period, but are based on fieldwork of a group of people who have been infected through a series of events that are identified as infectious.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for individual populations.
The estimates by the Centre for Reference-Based Medicine at Oxford University suggest that the overall mortality rate for the outbreak is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate for this range is consistent with the findings of the first randomized selective testing for COVID-19 in Germany and statistical analysis of the test's effect on mortality estimates.
The WHO claims that the epidemic is under control.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are unknown and can vary by location.
"If you let it go unchecked, the outbreaks will continue to spread normally and the infection may start to slow down as the infectious agents run out", said Massiboni of Penn State University.
The report, which was published in the journal Nature, says that the number of people who are affected by the pandemic is increasing.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said the epidemic could end by June if all countries follow WHO recommendations on measures to contain the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could spread for up to one or two years.
A study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson suggests that social distancing and other measures are needed until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schnapfer of the University of Vanderbilt said that "we don't see a complete disappearance of the coronavirus because it's spreading so fast", and that it "is likely to turn into a seasonal disease that seems to be coming back every year".
The likelihood of reinfection depends on the immunity and mutation levels of the population.
COVID-19 has no specific symptoms and people who are infected may not have any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high body temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, mucus-filled airways, loss of smell, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, trembling, vomiting, blockage of blood vessels, diarrhea, and ashes. WHO reports that one in six cases of the disease become seriously ill and shortness of breath.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends urgent symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking up, and a smudge of the face or lips. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended. Progression of further disease can lead to severe pneumonia, sudden breathlessness syndrome, asphyxiation and death from vomiting and blood poisoning.
Some infected individuals are found to be confirmed infected when tested without showing symptoms. Therefore, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and tested to rule out infection.
China estimates the number of asymptomatic cases to be between a few and 44%.
The typical onset period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days, with symptoms usually appearing within five days.In an uncertain example, the estimated number of patients with COVID-19 who experience loss of smell and taste was initially 30% and then decreased to 15%.
The virus is spread by a number of different organisms, including the human genome, including the human genome, and is also known as the "sympathetic virus".
The disease is believed to be transmitted primarily by close contact and small fluid particles emitted by coughing, sneezing or talking. Close contact is defined as being within 1 to 2 meters (3 feet to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without a cover can cause particles of liquid to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus may also be transmitted through particles from speech that can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory particles produced when breathing out while talking may also be transmitted, but the virus is not generally airborne.
The droplets can get into the mouths or nostrils of people nearby or they can be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause fluid to leak into the respiratory tract, allowing particles to reach the air and spread through the air.
It can also be spread when someone touches a contact surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus is transmitted by the feces, but the chances of it spreading are low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection from one person's feces to another's food.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can be transmitted before and during the later stages of the disease.
The diagnosis is made three days before the onset of symptoms, and the diagnosis is made before any obvious symptoms are present.
There have been few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infections, but asymptomatic infections have been detected in some countries during follow-up testing of suspected infections.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, it is common for one person to infect two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive on plastic (polymer propylene) and 304 steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
Humidity and temperature vary depending on the species.Pets and other animals have been tested for COVID-19.
Although there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, and that they do the same after contact with areas where an infected person may have been exposed.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first isolated in three people associated with a mass outbreak of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are in naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies in a household vacuum that dissolves its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin and can be transmitted from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that coronaviruses are genetically identical to two species of bats, with the most common being the serbicovirus (genus B) and the bettorona virus (genus B).
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the two strains of the plaque virus and the human strain.
So far, comparisons of the entire reproductive material of a living organism have found over 92% genetic similarity between the African ant-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the African ant-eater is a transmitter.
Although the presence of the virus can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, confirmation can only be done by replicating the DNA of an infected person and reversing the response (rRT-PCR) or CT scanning.
In a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR but had poor accuracy, with many imaging characteristics overlapping with other pneumonia and pathological events.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a diagnostic tool or as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The WHO has published a number of RNA testing procedures for SARS-CoV-2, with the first publication on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reverse transcription chemistry (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed with a breathing tube or blood sample.
The results of the tests are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed with a mouth scan or a throat scan, as is the case with oral scans. Laboratories and companies are expanding the use of plasma tests to test for antibiotics.
As of 6 April 2020, they have not been proven to be accurate enough to be widely available.
The US plasma test conducted by Cellex confirmed that only accredited laboratories had permission for emergency use.
X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are used to look for specific characteristics in people who are showing symptoms, including the appearance of asymmetrical, non-translucent areas within the primary lung and intra-pulmonary diarrhea.
The Italian Association of Radiologists is compiling image findings from confirmed patients and building an international online database.
Because of its similarity to other infectious symptoms, such as respiratory viruses, it is impossible to make a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 without PCR confirmation.
A large study in China compared the results of a chest CT scan with those of a PCR scan, demonstrating that imaging can be faster and easier to perform, although not as accurately as it is specifically for infection, and suggested that it should be used as a pre-exposure test tool in epidemic areas.
Complex neural networks based on artificial intelligence are being developed to image and diagnose the appearance of the virus using both X-ray and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing and sneezing into tissues and throwing the tissues directly into garbage cans.
Infected people are already advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Social distancing practices are also recommended to prevent infection.Many governments have banned and recommended that all non-essential travel to or from affected countries and regions be banned.
However, the virus has already reached a point of spread in communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and individuals within those communities may not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, such as pre-exposure protection and eye protection.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns for the security of personal information, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been proposed for implementation or voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using a user's Bluetooth to access another mobile phone as closely as possible.
Users will receive a notification if they have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Widespread misconceptions about infection prevention methods, such as rinsing the nose and rinsing the mouth with a mouthwash, are ineffective.
Despite the efforts of many organizations to develop and develop a cure for COVID-19, there is still no cure.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are significantly dirty, before eating, and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is outside the human body and causes the virus to burst into a bubble protected by household soap, killing it.
The CDC further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if you are not prepared to wash with soap and water.
The WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands.
Surfaces can remove a wide range of solvents, including 6271% alcohol, 50100% isoprosnol alcohol, 0.1% sodium hydrochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% porvidum-iodine (by exposure to disinfectant water within one minute for a single extreme stainless surface).
Other antibiotics, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are not very effective.
CDC recommends that all areas of contact with patients, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, tablets, touch screens, publicly used electronic devices such as keyboards, earphones, and ATMs, be disinfected if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in buildings such as offices or daycare.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with elbows, cover with tissue and discard tissue immediately if they cough or sneeze.
People at risk of infection are advised to wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask reduces the number and distance of fluid particles that can be spread by speech, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing face masks can reduce exposure to people without proper hand hygiene, their faces being a major source of infection.
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, but says that wearing masks can help people avoid contact with their face.
In many countries, campaigns have been launched to encourage people to wear face and nose masks in public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing masks made of non-medical cloth.In China, it is specifically recommended that people in good health use disposable medical masks if they have to be in close contact with people more than 1 meter (3 feet).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
Chernobyl and Slovenia have a ban on public travel without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged people to wear face masks to protect themselves and others when they travel to public places.
The Austrian government has issued a mandatory mask requirement for all people entering shopping malls.
In Israel, all people who visit public and public places are advised to wear masks.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, announced on April 1 that passengers on trains and intercity buses will be required to wear masks.
Panama has made wearing a mask compulsory whenever you go out and has also recommended making home-made masks for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (physical distancing) includes activities to control transmission of infection with the aim of slowing the spread of infection by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, indoor sports stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals can practice non-contact social lifestyle measures such as staying at home, traveling in limited numbers, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact speech and avoiding physical contact with others.
Many governments are now enforcing social distancing or encouraging social distancing in the affected areas.
The maximum number of people allowed to gather recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there is no local spread of COVID-19) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. The CDC recommended that older adults from areas with mass outbreaks and people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and those at high risk of serious illness from compromised immune systems stay at home as much as possible. By the end of March 2020, as WHO and other health organizations continue to have close or long-distance contact with people, social distancing was replaced by social distancing to help understand the goal of reducing physical contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been interpreted to imply that people should live in complete isolation from their environment rather than being encouraged to interact with others in informal ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
These include encouraging sex only with people who are not infected with the virus or who do not show symptoms.
Home isolation is recommended for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and for those who suspect they may have been infected.
Healthcare providers have issued detailed guidelines to follow when conducting appropriate self-quarantine.Many governments have also encouraged or legislated against self-quarantine for all residents of affected areas.
The most severe self-isolation and surveillance guidelines have been issued for members of the most at-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a person who is infected with COVID-19 or who have visited a region or country with a high prevalence of the disease are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of last contact.
The strategies used to control the spread of the disease are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The aim is to control the early stages of the outbreak, trace and isolate infected individuals, and implement alternative disease control measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the remaining population.
If the spread is no longer contained, a transition to mitigation is needed: measures to slow the spread and minimize its impact on healthcare systems and communities.
Both the prevention and mitigation functions can be performed simultaneously.
Reversing the global spread of the disease requires more rigorous measures to suppress the disease, such as reducing the number of primary infections to less than one.Peak infections are also being reduced as part of the effort to control the spread of infectious diseases.
This will reduce the risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed and allow more time for the process of finding a cure and treatment options.
Medical and non-medical interventions to control the spread of the disease include personal preventive measures such as hand sanitization, wearing face masks and self-isolation, organizational measures to reduce physical contact such as closing schools and avoiding public gatherings, community involvement to encourage adoption and participation, and environmental cleanup such as face sanitization.In China, outbreaks have been reported and many cities have been placed under city-wide lockdown and quarantine, with the strict lockdown and curfew imposed immediately.
Other countries have also used different measures to try to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and site quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to those who are infected and self-quarantine, and fines those who fail to do so with large sums of money.
Taiwan has increased production of face and nose masks and has imposed sanctions on the storage of medical supplies.Similar trials for the UK and the US have found great challenges in both mitigating (slowing down but not stopping the spread) and slowing (reversing the rate of epidemic growth).
The best mitigation policies can reduce health care needs by up to two-thirds and deaths by half, but hundreds of thousands of deaths occur, and health systems are still struggling.
However, if measures are relaxed during the entire time the virus is in the community (if a cure is available in the first place), infection can quickly resume and require containment.
The pandemic requires long-term action to contain and can have social and economic consequences.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop a vaccine, including testing existing drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the infection, oxygen therapy, anesthesia, and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several drugs that have been approved for use in the treatment of other viral diseases are also being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also said that traditional and home treatments can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO has identified capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a fundamental disease outbreak response strategy.
WHO's Regional Office for Europe and ECDC issued guidelines for hospitals and other resilient healthcare services to focus on laboratory testing for COVID-19 testing, eliminate voting procedures if possible, quarantine and isolate COVID-19-confirmed patients, increase capacity for intensive care by training staff, and replenish resources at multiple levels, including increasing availability of emergency respirators and beds.
There are various theories about what happens when the first patient (called the patient zero) is diagnosed.
The coronavirus outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019, and can be traced back to the beginning of the outbreak.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily rising.
They are mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals are also sold, and one theory is that the virus originated from the animal in question, or in other words, the virus has an animal-to-human origin. The outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to Wuhan Zhanghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues that they had a coronavirus similar to SARS.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was severely warned by her superiors for escalating panic attacks.
The Wuhan Health Commission later issued a statement to the public on December 31, informing the WHO.
After receiving sufficient reports of an outbreak of pneumonia, Wuhan health authorities began testing in early January.During the early stages of the infection, the number of infections doubled every seven and a half days.
The virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020, as Wuhan became a transportation hub and a major railway junction with travel for the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shaanxi.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the world's largest number of confirmed cases.On 9 April 2020, it was announced that there were 1.61 million confirmed cases worldwide, with 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case of the virus.
In Europe, the outbreak has led many countries in the Schengen area to restrict free movement and introduce border controls.
National-level measures include restrictive measures such as travel restrictions (also known as house arrest, house arrest, or lockdown) and curfews.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people - 90% of the population in the United States, more than 50 million in the Philippines, more than 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India - were under lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion (one-third of the world's population) two days later.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, and an unconfirmed report said the earliest outbreak was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a large group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, and reported the diagnosis to the Wuhan Jainghan CDC from her hospital on December 27, simultaneously with the diagnosis.
On 27 December 2019, a preliminary genetic test of a patient's genetic samples found the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
The Wuhan Administrative Health Commission issued a warning to the public on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Even as these warnings are being issued, doctors in Wuhan are being warned by police about spreading rumors about the infection.
The National Health Commission of China initially said there was no conclusive evidence of human-to-human transmission.

The city has banned the use of private vehicles.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (scheduled for January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced that they are building a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which will be completed in 10 days.
The hospital was built in order to treat the growing number of patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, 14 other facilities, such as the Convention Center and stadiums in Wuhan, were expanded into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government introduced additional measures, including issuing health notices for travelers and extending Spring Festival holidays, to control the spread of COVID-19.

Shincheonji worshippers who had been visiting Daegu, South Korea from Wuhan were suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
On 22 February, 1,261 or 13% of 9,336 churchgoers had symptoms.South Korea declared its highest alert level on 23 February 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection in Korea on February 28 rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been put into quarantine after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea has introduced what has been described as the world's largest and best-in-class collection program to screen people for the virus and isolate infected people, as well as track and quarantine those who have come into contact with them.
Testing techniques include mandatory reporting of symptoms from international travel and return via mobile applications, as well as on-the-go virus testing and test results the next day, increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's measures to contain the infection without imposing a city-wide quarantine can be considered successful. The South Korean public was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the epidemic.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment and supporting his response, saying the government is mismanaging the infection.
On March 23, South Korea reported its lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.

"When offering support to US counterparts, [Putin] believes that US pharmaceutical manufacturers will be able to help back when needed as production of medical equipment and equipment accelerates", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"The largest sunrise military exercise since the end of the Cold War, the NATO Defender 2020 military exercise, scheduled to take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, will be a scaled-down exercise".
"During the current public health crisis, not only troops from the United States and European countries are at risk, but also the lives of civilians in the countries where they are operating", said Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, in a statement, criticizing the Defender 2020 exercise.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent a letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020. The letter said his country was struggling to combat the spread of the epidemic due to limited access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions on Iran. The outbreak has led the United States and other rich countries to similarly call for the adoption of social policies, including inclusive health care, inclusive child care, family leave with pay, and higher funding for public health.
Political analysts expect Donald Trump to undermine his chances of winning the 2020 presidential election, as diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorate amid the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "lack of clarity and active efforts" when it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in two weeks of quarantine in government-designated areas.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
They say the signatures were either signed by Korean citizens to accuse Moon of mismanaging the outbreak by the government, or to praise his handling.
Some commentators have expressed fears that this could lead governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán unlimited powers, suspend elections and parliament, and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the epidemic.
The worldwide increase in the use of equipment to combat the spread of coronavirus has led to some cases of unnecessary supply cuts, panic buying, and shutdowns of factories and logistics.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical devices due to increased consumer demand and production delays.
In many places, panic and shopping crowds have led to shortages of essential items in grocery stores, including food, toilet paper and bottles of water.
The report also warns that the delivery of electronic products will be delayed, especially in the tech industry.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanomyan, the demand for personal water protection equipment has increased 100 times.
The demands have led to prices rising 20 times above normal and delayed the supply of medical supplies by four to six months.
The WHO warns that it has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity to buy daigo (buying from outside China for someone inside China) that sell Australian-made goods to China.
The movement led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets, which was subsequently banned by the Australian government. The COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy and Wuhan region was particularly severe in both regions, as a result of the rising demand for foodstuffs.
In an attempt to avoid a possible major food shortage in Europe and North America, China and Italy have banned the stockpiling and smuggling of critical products.
According to industry representatives, prices may rise, although there is no significant decline in agricultural production, which is important in northern Italy.
The empty food stands are only temporary. In Wuhan, the capital, Chinese government officials have released surplus meat to ensure that people have enough to eat.
Italy has similar laws that set out requirements for food producers to store reserves in such emergencies.
The global economic impact hit China hard.On March 16, a news outlet reported that China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020, with retail sales falling 20.5% due to measures taken by the government to slow the spread of the virus.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, and was identified as a major threat to the global economy during the outbreak.
Agatha Damaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the impact of the current pandemic recession on global development could be worse than during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates the impact on the global supply chain could be more than $300 billion and could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reports that oil prices have been in a state of hysteria since the collapse of the low demand from China.
Global stock markets plunged on February 24 as the number of COVID-19 infections outside China spiked dramatically.
On February 27, rising concerns about the coronavirus caused the fall of US stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set a record for the most since 2008. The Dow fell 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 recession.
All three indices fell by more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH approved China's debt rating, but maintained a negative attitude.
The stock market fell again on March 16 in its biggest ever fall, based on coronavirus fears.
Many people consider the possibility of a recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency response by central banks and countries.
The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors worst affected by travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist attractions, and government advisories against all travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantum Airlines, have canceled flights due to low passenger numbers, and the British domestic airline Flybe has collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry is reaching unprecedented levels.
Many railway stations and airports in the city of Kauai have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, the main tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Private companies have also closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland at their own discretion, and many large-scale events, including the annual New Year celebrations, have been cancelled by national and local governments.
Many Chinese New Year celebrations and tourist attractions in Beijing, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple compounds, are closed to prevent crowds.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces, cities and regions under the Local Government System have extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and have ordered most businesses not to reopen before that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has declared a state of emergency, closing schools and cancelling New Year's Eve celebrations until March, and has also hit retailers around the world with reduced opening hours and temporary closures.
In Europe and Latin America, visits to retail stores have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50 to 60 percent drop.
In addition, the number of people walking to shopping malls in March decreased by 43% from 33 in February.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America after the outbreak will rise from 14 million to 22 million compared to pre-pandemic levels.
During the January and February 2020 high infection rate in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Nearly 300 million migrant workers from rural China are either confined to their homes in mining areas or trapped inside Hubei province. More than 10 U.S. citizens lost their jobs and sought government assistance in March 2020.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis estimates that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to 47 million job losses in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has left more than ten million Indian migrant workers (day laborers) unemployed. A survey by Angus Reid University found that 44% of Canadian households were similarly unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers received temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers were covered by a comprehensive credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to government-sponsored short-term work programs known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term workplace compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The outbreak has caused a major impact on the arts and cultural heritage sectors, affecting the organisation's operations as well as individual employees and freelancers globally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector have tried to continue their mission (often supported by the government) of providing access to culture to the public, keeping their employees and the public safe at all times, and providing artists with all possible support.
In March 2020, universities, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural facilities around the world were closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, festivals and performances were cancelled or suspended.
In response, there have been vigorous efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapid acceleration due to the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as concerts and stage shows, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that it had also cancelled its attendance at the Resurrection Week in Rome, which was held on the last weekend of the fasting Sabbath, to commemorate the suffering of Christ.
Many dioceses have advised elderly Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday Mass. While some are driving in and offering services, some churches have made the prayers available via radio, online live broadcast, or television.
The city's Roman Catholic cathedrals and private meeting places and Christian religious services were closed, and other religious services were canceled, and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, chapels and caves were banned.
Iran's health ministry banned Friday prayers in the infected areas, and subsequently closed mosques. Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the country and banned its citizens from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant stoppages in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or suspended, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season.
Plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July, were suspended due to the pandemic. The International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the Games could be held no later than summer 2021 and no later than 2020. Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed, and live-streamed poker tournaments were postponed.
This has led to many gamblers turning to online gambling, and according to online gambling sites, they have significantly increased their new subscriptions. The entertainment industry has also been impacted, and many bands have had to postpone or cancel tours.
The film was shot in the early 1990s in the city of New York.
Some artists have sought ways to continue and share their work on the Internet instead of the traditional live performance format, such as creating live-streamed dances or web-based festivals where artists perform, distribute and send their work to audiences.
In the midst of the unrest, many people have turned to humor and distraction, and many coronavirus-related internet memes have emerged.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people of East Asian descent and from affected areas have seen a decline in their sense of self-worth, increased xenophobia, and increased racism in Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere.
Fear, suspicion and hostility are common in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia and North America and the Asia Pacific region.
Since February (when most cases are still in China), reports have documented racial stereotypes expressed by various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or are being punished justly.
The anti-China sentiment in some African countries is also rising.
Many of the people who settled in Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against based on their place of residence.
Chinese citizens in the affected areas received support not only online but also from outside.
Increased suspicion and fear has been generated in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak following the spread of the disease to new countries that had not been infected before.Nations including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to bar Chinese nationals from entering their countries in an effort to stem the spread of the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular in Japan.
Other Asian people, including Chinese in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racism and discrimination, as well as physical abuse.
The US President Donald Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus" has been criticized by critics as anti-Chinese and racist.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreigners who were being evacuated from Wuhan to Novosibirsk.
Students from the northeastern part of India, which borders China, who are studying in major Indian cities say they have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Dil Ghosh, the state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese are "God's revenge on them for destroying nature".
The Chinese military office in Kaliningrad later condemned the comments, which could be described as "untrue". The outbreak has sparked fears about non-Chinese living in China and a bloody campaign of racial apartheid, with foreigners being described as "garbage cans" and targeted as "things to be disposed of".
Many newspapers with paid access to news have removed the option of subscription access to all or some of their news stories about the coronavirus outbreak.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers about the spread of disease available to anyone.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results on the pre-print servers of bioRxiv.
A growing infectious disease - an infectious disease of an emerging pathogen, often unique in its scale or transmission.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
RT-PCR, which detects and tests for ribonucleic acid (RNA) of coronaviruses, confirmed the presence of the virus in patients.
This test is specifically designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
Recent or active outbreaks have been confirmed.
Antibody detection (plasmology) can be used for both disease diagnosis and community-based follow-up.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have had the disease, including those with mild symptoms too weak to report or those without symptoms.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the levels of herd immunity among the population.
Due to testing restrictions, no country was able to release reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population until March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests conducted varies widely across countries.
This variation also appears to have a significant impact on the mortality rate of diagnosed cases, which is significantly more predicted in some countries.
Using real-time polymerase chain reverse transcription chemistry (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on a variety of types of coated airway samples, including a nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus then disappears in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the second week, infected individuals tested can either use a tube that sucks samples from the deep respiratory tract or cough up (spit).
In January 2020, an early PCR test using real-time polymerase chain reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) was performed at the Charité in Berlin, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits for the World Health Organization (WHO) distribution.
Unit One also released a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech released a treatment-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector kit on 28 January 2020.
It looked for E genome in all coronavirus beats and specific genome RdRp for SARS-CoV-2 virus.In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed its 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tool to public health laboratories via an international response resource.
The results were not all inclusive due to the fact that one of the three genetic tests in the previous range of test materials was a chemical synthesis and bottleneck testing at the CDC in Atlanta, which had an average of less than 100 successful tissue samples per day for the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using both materials were not approved until February 28, 2020, when state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.Tests by U.S. commercial laboratories began in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of the RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Quest Diagnostics did the same on March 9, 2020, making COVID-19 testing available nationwide.
No number limitations have been announced; tissue sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with the CDC's specific requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and manufactured by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Immunization in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that would be performed in large numbers in 3.5 hours, allowing a total of 4,128 tests per machine to be performed in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA has previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cepheid also received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for a 45-minute trial on March 21, 2020.
The FDA approved a test using isomalt-nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
This eliminates the need for the necessary adjustments to the changing temperature cycle, but this method can provide positive symptoms in five minutes and negative symptoms in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.Taiwan is developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically synthesized from the novel coronavirus nucleocarp (N protein) and is expected to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 language review found that while X-ray images of the lymph node have little value for diagnosis in the early stages, CT (computed tomography) findings may be available even before symptoms appear.
Typical features on CT include the discovery of a large number of granular clay plates on both sides with no lateral distribution and no lateral edge alignment.
As the disease progresses, a pattern of dominance, madness and solidarity develops.
Although a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current global epicenter, has less accuracy, its findings have many overlaps with other pneumonia and disease progression, and CT has the potential to be significantly more predictive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT not be used as a first-line test for testing or diagnosing COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR as a primary test.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to diagnose infection, assess immunity and isolate people 7 days and older from the onset of symptoms. Diagnostic tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or point-of-care testing (PoCT) sites.
Although high-thinkput automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, their effectiveness will depend on the rate of output of each system.
Although sequential tissue samples can be used to study immune system response, CLT is usually used in a blood sample in the extremities.
A single blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by skin piercing.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction levels are not required before assaying.On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 organizations that had notified the agency and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European Union approvals for their pathogen test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies that can fight the virus in human blood samples.
It is much faster than the traditional PCR viral RNA test because it can test hundreds of samples in hours.
Antibodies are usually detectable within 14 days of the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that antibody testing kits they purchased did not work properly.
Hong Kong has established a system where suspected patients are kept at home  The emergency department will give the patient a glass tube with a sample of tissue from the patient They spit into it and return it, and the results will be known soon.The UK NHS has announced that a model of testing suspected patients at home is a first.
The drive-through testing centers help South Korea to have the fastest and most extensive testing available of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they can perform 12,000 pounds of tests per day in a quarantined environment, up from 10,700 tests a week earlier.
The cost of the test is covered by the insurance company when the doctor prescribes it.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total test capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
The test drive was launched in many cities on March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are published.
The first laboratory survey revealed 33,491 samples of SARS-CoV-2 detected (6.9%) and a total of 483,295 tissue samples during the calendar week of 12/2020, including the week of 12/2020. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel have developed a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously. The test is to collect samples and conduct further tests only if the aggregate sample shows pathogenicity.
A five-day model, developed under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian, predicts that if this testing capacity is not implemented, infections in Hubei could rise by 47 percent and the cost of handling the travel quarantine could double.
The Wuhan lab and the Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai Huayang clinics immediately followed in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, Daily Pass Test has 50,000 tests per day. Open source, many of which are sophisticated, and manufactured by Origami Assays, the machine can test for COVID-19 on 1122 tissue samples from just 93 assays in one day. These biased designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for skilled robots.
By March, there was a shortage of reagents, which led to a push for mass testing in the EU, UK and US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation procedures that involve heating samples for 5 minutes at 98 °C (208 °F) to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that it was now testing more coronavirus per capita in its population than any other country, reaching a point where it could reach a major majority of its population.
The study combined the ability to drive through and the purchase of a large-scale mass-assisted dissection by Group 42 and BGI (Huo-Yan Emergency Search in their laboratories in China).
The lab, which took 14 days to build, performed tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, making it the first lab in the world outside China to operate on this scale.
Various clinical trials targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been explored in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization provides German ingredients for a range of products to low-income countries without the need for resources to produce them themselves.
The German drug combination was released on 17 January 2020. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delayed the availability of the tests in the US and they were not available until 28 January.In the early stages of the outbreak, China and the United States had concerns about the reliability of test kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to adequately distribute test kits and tests supported by health professionals until demand was met.
In contrast, South Korea's widespread testing availability could help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, experts say.
The South Korean government has built up testing capacity in private labs over the years, mainly through the use of the Internet.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization urged the acceleration of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being accumulated in private laboratories in the US, cutting off supplies and chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, a test kit produced by the CDC contained "defects". The government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. The test kit in Spain was purchased from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but the results were found to be inaccurate.
The company explains that erroneous results can be the result of shortcomings in sample collection or the correct use of test kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall the diagnostic kits that produced erroneous results and replace them with diagnostic kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, a biotechnology company.80% of Chinese-made diagnostic kits purchased by the Czech Republic produced erroneous results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million Chinese-made diagnostic kits and found that they did not produce correct results.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that they be dumped into the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and were not used.
Testing and isolating infected individuals and tracing contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, which recorded the first COVID-19 death in Italy, isolated about 3,400 of the city's population for 10 days and tested everyone twice.
About half of those tested did not show symptoms, and all those who tested positive were placed in quarantine.
The country has also been a target for the coronavirus pandemic.
Intensive contact tracing, testing, and quarantine have found that the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore spreads much more slowly than in other developed countries, without the need for extreme restrictions on restaurants and retail outlets.
After cancelling many events and urging residents to stay indoors on March 28, schools reopened on March 23 after the end of the school holidays.
Many other countries have implemented strict contact tracing, restrictions on travel and quarantine in their pandemic management, but restrictions are not strict enough: Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more had a very low mortality rate in relation to the number of deaths, possibly because they were better able to detect weak or nonexistent symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five detected samples and first ten COVID-19-free samples to one of the 16 WHO-designated laboratories for validation testing.
Of the 16 index labs, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
The following table shows the percentage of people who are infected with HIV in the following tests, as affected by the country's testing policy:
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive tests, even if they are similar in other respects, compared to countries that test citizens nationwide whether they have symptoms or not.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of washing one's hands with the intention of removing dirt, oils, germs, or other undesirable objects.
Washing hands frequently with soap at certain critical times of the day can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and epilepsy, which are spread by the fecal-oral route.
People can also catch respiratory infections such as the common cold or flu if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (mucous membranes).
The most important times of the day to wash your hands with soap and water include before and after going to the toilet, changing your child's underwear or changing diapers, feeding your child, preparing food, or handling raw meat, fish, or pork.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing: Washing your hands with soap and water is recommended for people with severe allergies.
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a deaf person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a baby after using the toilet.
The following is a list of common symptoms of snoring and other disorders.
The report also highlights the impact of the recent outbreak of the coronavirus.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the environmental hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or reduce infection.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogenic microorganisms) and chemicals that are harmful or may cause disease.
It is especially important for those who handle food substitutes or work in a medical environment, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing can have many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrheal infections, and reducing respiratory infections.
The report also found that the number of births at home has decreased.
A 2013 study showed that increasing handwashing habits may lead to a slight improvement in long-term development in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates are linked to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, which can be reduced by adopting simple behavioral changes such as soap and hand washing.
This simple action can reduce the number of deaths from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea events by a third, comparable to providing access to clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea occurred with soap and hand washing.Soap and hand washing are one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as autoimmune diseases, in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The leading ARI, pneumonia, is the leading cause of death in children under five years old, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
The report also highlights the need for a global approach to preventing and treating diarrhea.
According to UNICEF, making it a regular practice to wash hands with soap and soap before and after eating and using the toilet could save more lives than vaccines or medications, reduce deaths from gastrointestinal illness by almost a quarter, and reduce deaths from respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Handwashing is often associated with other wastewater interventions as part of water, sanitation and environmental (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents scars from being spread by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing causes skin damage by drying out the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin rash known as itching, hives, or hand pain, which is common among health care workers.
Washing hands too often is a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times of the day to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of infection from stool to mouth: after using the toilet (toilet and pantry), after cleaning your baby's face (exchanging diapers), before feeding, before eating and before preparing food or handling raw meat, raw fish or poultry.
Other times when proper hand sanitizer should be used to prevent infection include before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing, after handling animal waste or handling animals, and after handling litter.
In most countries, soap and handwashing are very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that about 38.7% of households practice soap and handwashing. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was at a moderate level at 77%, and China was the lowest at 23%. Several behavioral modification measures have been developed to improve soap and handwashing behavior at critical times.
The "Integrated Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
The national program is based on the practice of flossing twice a year, washing hands daily with soap and brushing teeth daily with fluoride toothpaste.
It is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is facilitated by soap in water or detergent soap powder.
The main function of soap blocks and soap powders is to reduce barriers to dissolution and increase solubility.
The natural components of the soil, such as fats and proteins, are not easily soluble in water, so washing the skin with water alone is not an effective cleanser.
However, cleaning is facilitated by proper water flow.
Due to its recyclable nature, soap bars can retain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that have studied bacterial transmission from infected soap creams have concluded that removing the bacteria with soap sponge is not likely to cause transmission.
The CDC recommends that people use more hand-washing soap.
The soap is designed to kill bacteria and is especially advertised for health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of recommended antibiotics or of antibiotics that are used to target naturally resistant bacteria.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as trichloroquine, which have many layers of resistance to the organisms.
Therefore, for bacterial-killing soaps, even if antibiotic resistance is not selected, they may not be as effective as they are designed to be.
In addition to exfoliants and skin care products, many modern formulations use acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as a disinfectant, and other skin conditioners (such as shampoo, vitamins, peppermint, and vegetable oils). A comprehensive analysis by the Oregon State University of Public Health also showed that soaps such as antibacterial soaps, which are effective in preventing illness and eliminating bacteria, are suitable for consumers.
The ideal water heater for hand washing is not so hot that it kills bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soap in removing impurities and bacteria-containing natural fats.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the presence of microbes on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based towels, antibiotic towels, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are formulated as a gel using isopropane alcohol or ethanol, a thickening agent called carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), or as a liquid using a humicant such as glycine, or as a foam to facilitate consumption and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of weak hydrogen peroxide further enhances the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Alcoholic detergents kill bacteria, high levels of drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and certain viruses (including HIV, waterborne disease, RSV, rhinovirus, smallpox, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcohol-containing 70% alcohol hand sanitizer kills 99.97% of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after rinsing (a reduction of 3.5 l or 35 decibels) and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 l reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after rinsing. Hand sanitizers are most effective for bacteria and less effective for some viruses.
For the most common infectious norovirus or norovirus, which causes gastroenteritis, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective. Use hand sanitizers or rubbing with alcohol to keep both hands moist or clean with adequate amount of alcohol.
Both the front and back sides of the hands and the middle and tips of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or jelly dries.
Wash fingertips by rubbing them with both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands be washed when they are significantly dirty instead of rubbing them with hand sanitizer.
The increased use of this solution is based on its ease of use and its ability to kill microbes quickly. However, if available, proper soap and water washing should not be substituted.
If the medications do not contain softeners and/or moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
Adding ointments and/or other skin softeners to the formula can reduce or eliminate the dry skin effect of epilepsy.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with skin softeners caused much less itching and dryness than soap or antibacterial detergents.
Allergies to alcohol, skin discoloration, contact plasma syndrome, or allergic reactions to alcohol or addiction to alcohol towels are rare.
The study found that the incidence of skin rashes caused by uncomfortable contact is less than that of hand washing with soap and water.
While these are effective, non-water disinfectants do not disinfect hands, but they do disinfect hands simply.
This is because the pathogens remain on the hands and hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and composition of the formula, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol sprays.
Recent formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown consistent and combined antimicrobial activity when used, unlike alkaloids, which have a decreased efficacy, possibly due to increased side effects on the skin after repeated use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but not as effective as soap.
A concern is that soil or ashes contaminated with microorganisms can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is a pathogenic agent because it forms alkali liquids when in contact with water.
The WHO recommends using ashes and sand instead of soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes the following steps:
Keep your hands moist with running hot or cold water.
Since upright hand sanitizers can be contaminated, it is recommended to use only continuous running water if there is no temperature difference.
Rub your hands with soap from the palms, between the fingers, and under the nails until the foam is removed.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water.
Rub and rinse for at least 20 seconds.
Peeling causes friction and removes bacteria from the skin, while long peeling can help remove more bacteria.
Wash thoroughly with a constant stream of water.
Washing hands in a dishwasher can make your hands dirty again.
Wipe dry with a clean cloth or let it air dry.
Wet and damp hands are prone to germ contamination, and the most common areas to be contaminated are the thumb, wrist, fingertips, and under the nails.
The use of nail polishes, which are separate from artificial nails, can harbor microbes.
To keep hands dry, moisturizing lotions are often recommended. Dry skin can cause skin damage, which in turn increases the risk of spreading infections.
"For example, by pouring water from a hanging rectangular bucket or dry bottle with appropriate sized holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries, a variety of low-cost options for performing handwashing can be made available in places where tap water and/or soap are unavailable. Water-saving solutions such as 'TP taps' and other low-cost options are available in situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries)".
A tap is a simple technique where a well of water is drawn by a rope and a small amount of water is poured into the hands and soap by foot.
Although effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand sanitization process, the most efficient form of hand drying in public toilets is still debated.
A number of studies suggest that hand towels are cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a tissue paper manufacturer, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels of tissue paper, air dryers and more modern air dryers for prevention of disease.
After hand washing and air drying, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Air-drying drying increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on fingers and 15% on palms.
After washing hands and wiping with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and on the palms by 77%. Scientists conducted tests to confirm whether each method of drying was likely to spread to other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The hand dryer, which is air-pumped from the machine at 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing out the microorganisms from the hands and the machine to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to a maximum distance of 2 meters.
The use of hot-oil hand dryers allows the spread of microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The paper was found to be significantly free of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand drying with towels is compared to hand dryers.
Hand sanitizer is a useful method when traveling where soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing has been a standard practice in the medical field for a long time, since the effectiveness of handwashing in preventing illness in a hospital environment was discovered by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in 1846.
The hospital has electronic devices that can alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that using them reduced infection rates.
Medical hand washing is the practice of rubbing each part of the hands with soap and water for at least 15 seconds, or applying a gel to the skin.
The hand should be rubbed with fingers.
If there is damage under the nails, bristle brushes can be used to remove it.
Microbes can remain in the water from the hands, so it is important to rinse the water and wipe it dry with a clean cloth.
After drying, use towel paper to seal the drain (and open any exit doors if necessary).
It prevents re-infection from these surfaces to the hands.
"The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("pathogens") and prevent their spread".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that while poor hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching a patient, which can lead to infection by microorganisms.
Proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of bloodstream infections associated with asthma by 66 percent, a study showed.The World Health Organization has distributed a paper illustrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare settings.
The organization's hand hygiene guidelines are also available for public comment on its website.
The relevant review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial hand sanitizers can measure and verify hand sanitization if compliance with regulations is required.
"The World Health Organization defines five 'moments' for hand washing:
After contact with blood/intestinal fluids
Before and after a pathogen-free activity
After treatment of the patient. In addition to soap, additional antibiotic chemicals (such as medicated or antimicrobial soaps) are added to the hand sanitizer to add disinfectant activity.
Such killing is necessary in situations where antibiotic-treated microorganisms are abundant or before surgery. The operation requires a self-closing tap, a chloride or iodine wash, a sterile towel for washing and drying, a rubbing brush for rubbing, and additional sterile equipment for cleaning under the fingernails.
The government has also been urging the government to remove all gloves.
This procedure involves washing hands and palms up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't require a long, ten-minute fling.
The water should be washed with a clean cloth and not run back into the hands.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of pathogens, wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after treating the patient.
The best benefit of handwashing for controlling staphylococcal infections in hospitals was found to occur in the first 20% of washings, with the least additional benefit being obtained when handwashing frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Washing with plain soap and detergent has a three-fold higher rate of bacterial infection of food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Rubbing hands with alcohol-based liquids and washing hands with an antibacterial soap for a median of 30 seconds were compared, with rubbing hands with alcohol reducing the bacterial content by 26% more than washing with an antibacterial soap.
Handwashing with soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the number of hands infected with H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile, which cause diarrhea. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and providing written and verbal warnings to employees.
The most effective of these measures in different healthcare settings needs to be explored further.
In developing countries, soap and hand washing are recognized as a cost-effective and vital way to improve health and nutrition.
However, the lack of access to water, soap or hand sanitizer in homes, schools and workplaces can be a challenge to global adoption of handwashing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, where there are inexpensive options to build sinks, there are very few sinks near private or public toilets.
However, the low handwashing rate is more likely to be due to habitual habits than to a lack of soap or water.
The campaign and advocacy for soap and hand washing can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral change for many people.
It requires monitoring and evaluation to make it work effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based action approaches in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries) are effective in promoting more handwashing practices, while social media marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of how to promote handwashing practices in schools is UNICEF's Three-Star Method, which encourages students to use simple and cost-effective methods in schools to ensure that their hands are thoroughly washed with soap, among other measures for personal hygiene.
When meeting the minimum standards, schools can go from one star to a maximum of three stars.
The construction of handwashing facilities could be part of a campaign to promote handwashing, which aims to reduce illness and infant mortality.
World Handwriting Day is an example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the use of handwriting emojis.
Some studies have considered the overall cost savings of handwashing in developing countries by eliminating DALYs.
However, one review found that promoting handwashing with soap and water is significantly cheaper than other water-sanitary interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of personal hand hygiene, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an Englishwoman who founded modern nursing.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by bad odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and healthcare-associated infectious diseases led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 outbreak of swine flu and the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap and soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "proper hand washing practices" are hung next to toilets and hand washing basins in public toilets and office buildings, and at airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" means that someone declares that they will not take responsibility for or participate in something.
The term originates in the Gospel of Matthew, where the apostate Pontius Pilate washes his hands for his decision to crucify Jesus, but has become a more widely used phrase in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands thoroughly in an attempt to clear the reflective image, reflecting her sense of guilt for the crimes she committed and the sins she incited her husband to commit.
People wash their hands more often than others after recalling or thinking about their unethical behavior, and they value handwashing devices more.
In addition, people who have this kind of mindfulness and are later allowed to wash their hands are less likely to engage in other alternative cleaning activities, such as volunteering.
Religious doctrines prescribe hand washing for cleansing and ceremonial purposes. Hand washing with water alone, without soap, is a traditional method of hand washing used in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, the Twelver and Netila Yad-Yam of Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and the Waddhu of Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam teach that people should wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Risk management at work for COVID-19.
Occupational risk controls for COVID-19 include the use of occupational safety and health measures for risk controls to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control in the workplace depends on the workplace and job objectives, risk testing of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and potential risk factors for individual workers who are at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with high or low exposure to other co-workers are those with a low risk of infection, and basic infection prevention measures are recommended for such occupations, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, following proper procedures for sneezing and coughing, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace environment.
Jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, as well as those that may be exposed to the virus due to mass transmission or international travel, also include those with a moderate risk of infection.
This includes workers who are exposed to the general public, such as schools, crowded work environments, and some positions with high wholesale volumes.
In addition to basic infection prevention activities, risk controls for this group include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing masks, and having personal protective equipment if you need to contact someone with COVID-19.
Healthcare or dental workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of exposure if they are workers who collect or handle tissue samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients or have to handle airborne particulates.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure, well-ventilated rooms and personal protective equipment that is appropriate to the job objective.
The COVID-19 outbreak has many impacts in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
The patterns of trade can change both in terms of goods in demand and how to get those goods (e.g. shopping away from rush hour, or door-to-door delivery or pick-up services).
Eventually, shipments of goods from areas where COVID-19 has been severely spread may be delayed.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for preventive actions.
The projects address measures of individual workers' risk factors, such as sources of exposure, risks associated with different workplaces and occupational goals, risks arising from the structure of homes and communities, and aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and can provide backup measures for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparatory and response plans for the epidemic should be based on national or local recommendations.
The objectives for the response to the outbreak include reducing infection among employees, protecting people at higher risk for subsequent health events, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on their supply chains to other businesses.
In the workplace community, the severity of the disease affects the response that is being done.
Risk management stepwise is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group risk management steps by effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by operational controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Executive control is the change in the work policies or procedures required of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is not as effective as engineering and management controls, but it helps protect against some types of exposure.
All PPE must be selected based on the worker's workplace hazards, properly fitted (e.g. inhalers), uniformly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, exchanged as necessary, properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of without tampering.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with low exposure risks have the lowest occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
Basic infection prevention practices recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home in bad weather, covering their coughs and sneezes, donating tissue and keeping it for disposal, preparing for remote communications or isolating workstations if necessary, prohibiting workers from using other programs and equipment, and maintaining and disinfecting regular hygiene practices in the workplace and environment.
Early detection and isolation of susceptible individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of sudden respiratory illness stay home until they have at least 24 hours without fever, hypertension, or other symptoms, without taking flu medications or medications that modify symptoms, and that flexible sick leave policies be in place to allow employees to stay home and care for sick family members, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, occupations with frequent or close contact with patients suspected of having COVID-19 or with unknown persons within six feet (1.8 m) of the person are considered to be of moderate risk of infection. However, the person may have recently traveled across the country to an area where COVID-19 is spreading or may have local transmission around the business area where the patient works.
These include workers who have had one-time exposure to the general public, such as schools, crowded work environments, and some high-risk retail establishments. In addition, engineering controls for higher-risk groups include installing highly effective air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic inhaler masks, and installing drive-through curtains for customer service, installing a mask, using a set of emergency clothing, training for more high-risk groups, and training for workers who are at risk of exposure to sunlight, providing written instructions on how to avoid face-to-face contact with water, providing workers with a comprehensive schedule of vaccinations and other information about the need to protect themselves and others from exposure to COVID-19, including the need to wear protective clothing or other protective gear, and providing training on how to protect themselves from exposure to the most dangerous situations, such as when workers are in danger of COVID-19, when they need to travel to work or when they are in danger of being exposed to the most dangerous situations.
The workers in this high-risk group do not usually need to use respirators.
If someone becomes ill on board, proper controls to properly protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick person at a 6-foot distance from others, assigning a flight attendant to care for the sick person, and giving the sick person a mask when coughing or sneezing or having the sick person cover his or her nose and mouth with tissue paper.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves when handling contagious surfaces or body fluids, or when servicing a sick passenger. If possible, aircrew should wear additional personal protective equipment if a sick passenger shows symptoms of fever or persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Dispose of gloves and other disposable items in biohazardous bags and clean and inspect any surfaces that come in contact with them. Risk control measures, including postponement of sick leave and self-isolation for commercial vessels, including luxury cruise ships and other passenger vessels, and prompt notification of the on-board health centre if high temperature or other symptoms occur during cruising, are in place.
The CDC recommends that schools and childcare facilities temporarily close for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has been on campus, whether or not the infection is spreading in the community.
When there is a low to moderate mass transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings, and other large social gatherings such as exercising or singing lessons, or eating at a coffee shop; increasing space between tables; scheduling to avoid clashing arrival and departure times; limiting nonessential visitors; and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
At times when there are high infections in indigenous communities, social distancing strategies and extended school closures may be considered.The CDC determines that there is a low immediate health risk for law enforcement officers who are performing their daily routine activities.
Law enforcement officials who are in constant contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical professionals, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact has occurred during an emergency, workers should clean and disinfect their gears and gear with household cleaning spray or wipes before reusing them, and then follow the guidelines for the installation and disposal of used PPE and the installation and removal of clothing.
OSHA classifies certain healthcare and surgery workers as high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, supply, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 cases.
If workers are collecting or handling from known or suspected COVID-19 cases and have airborne particles on them, they are at very, very high risk.
Some procedures that release particulate matter into the air include tubing, cough reduction procedures, aerial tubing examination, certain dental procedures and tests, or the taking of tissue samples from the body.
High-risk chest work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of patients who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death. They are at very high risk if they perform chest examinations. They also perform additional engineering operations control for those at risk groups, including procedures that produce airborne particles, including the isolation of rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation systems are suitable for certain healthcare facilities and air conditioning units.
Tissue samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 preventive measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients be placed in quarantine areas based on the presence or absence of suspected COVID-19 cases. OSHA recommends that people who are suspected or known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who are working within 6 feet of patients and perform procedures such as ventilation with a tube in the airway, wear respirators in addition to PPE.
In the United States, in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection plan that includes fitness testing, training, and medical testing, NIOSH-approved N95 filter mask respirators or better are required.
Other respiratory masks can provide more protection and make workers more comfortable. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness rather than a transmission through body fluids, so WHO does not recommend covering everyone.
WHO recommends that only a surgical mask be worn by staff who are screened at the entrance.
WHO recommends that those who take a respiratory tissue sample from COVID-19 patients, care for patients or transport them without the production of particulate matter in the air, wear a surgical mask, swimming goggles or face mask, suit and gloves.
If you are performing a procedure that produces particulate matter into the air, surgical masks are replaced by N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Due to insufficient global supply of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE to the minimum by using modern communication technology to provide healthcare (telemedicine), using physical barriers such as glass windows, allowing people to wear a suit if they are going to be in direct contact with a COVID-19 patient in a room, using PPE only for work-related tasks, not removing a single respirator continuously when treating multiple patients with the same disease, encouraging monitoring and coordination of the use of PPE supplies, and not encouraging masking for asymptomatic users.

The month of Ramadan is a time when people seek out their own status.
The spread of COVID-19 has made clear the interconnectedness and responsibility of our humanity around the world.
Although we have no tradition for these challenges, we know that our best response will depend on global empathy, collaboration, and community building at the heart of this organization.
The courageous spirit and care I saw among all my colleagues through emails, phone calls and text messages are a testament to the admirable humanity we are fortunate to have to work together.
I could not be happier and more proud of you all.
Last week someone said they were honored for their work.
They are a reminder to the world of how much Wikipedia means to change right now and a powerful signal for this important resource to stay online and accessible to all.
Whether you wake up at work, or your colleagues give you a wake-up call, or your community is safe, it's because of the work you've done.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia now more than ever.
The moment now is not only about what we do but also how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
The Bible says: "The one who has a good conscience is wise, and the one who has a bad heart is wise".
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-team discussed their approach and schedule for the coming days and months the night before.
In that speech, they considered their thinking to be the appropriate response to what they were facing and the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization during this time.
Overall, I want to help you eliminate stress and support your long-term business goals.
If you need to call back, it's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors and workers:
Their daily work expectations are 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
The missionaries are not on holiday - if you can work overtime, the mission can use you.
The world is unpredictable, but our priority is to meet every need, whether it's getting care for a loved one, buying supplies, or seeing a doctor.
It's not about taking your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
The article was written by a journalist from the city of Karachi.
The following article will help you to make sure that you are not too busy to work: "I am not too busy to work", says a friend who works in a factory.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please notify Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can help ensure you receive appropriate attention from support and management.)
The workers will be paid full wages.
As we have said, we are once again determined to honor our hard work for our contractors and hourly colleagues.
Under normal circumstances, everyone would be paid based on their regular working hours.
The letter says that you are sick and should not work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work to change their minds about stress in their environment.
I am very happy to do what we can do, especially in this time.
The next time, it's up to you to take care of yourself.
We ask that you contact your manager, so that we can know what we need to do and negotiate accordingly.
(Matthew 6:33) The Bible says that "the work of the Lord is good".
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust, and Security and Fundraising teams (among other departments) do important work to provide the extra support they need.
We will work with all departments to shift our focus to identify current goals and support what is essential to our business goals.
There is a lot of work for all of you, and we will all focus on the more important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt in the future.
We don't plan to double down on our time to catch up once we're over the pandemic.
You won't have to take overtime to meet deadlines, which are no longer possible.
The United States has accepted that these conditions have changed and will work to set new targets and appropriate timelines.
What about the APP?
We would like to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 annual plan to balance our new reality and daily work schedule expectations.
The goal is to propose an extension of their 2019-2020 plan, which allows employees more time for budgeting to prioritize important work, taking care of themselves and their loved ones, to allow those who want or need to work reduced schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule greatly reduces the workloads and pressure on the entire organization.
The following week, we will present our proposal to the board, and once we have received their approval, we will inform the delegates and team about the final terms in the next step.
Thank you to the APP team for leading the way here.
The office environment, touch, and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco was potentially infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, among many things to note, we hired a virus-fighting team to disinfect all the surfaces of our desk, chairs, etc. in our San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral creams to disinfect not only every surface, but also the living rooms and the stairs leading to their floors.
The building has a self-care policy for the use of materials that support the safety of their tenants.
When they decide to return, the office is well prepared and makes them feel comfortable.
Their DC office is located in WeWork, where they share COVID-19 procedures with themselves and all DC-based employees.
In line with guidelines shared from San Francisco, we converted our DC office to a fully remote system last week.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, we are also in the process of hiring a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of my colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
The long-term remote colleagues know that this is a balancing act and want to give you some tips.
The meeting duration should be limited to one or two hours maximum.
If you need longer tasks, think about how you're going to group them over a few weeks.
Clearly describe the meeting, plan it, and inform the audience in advance of what you're going to read.
Keep the video as original to facilitate live collaboration and communication with programs like Google Docs and Zoom.
Lead each meeting to make it smooth and enjoyable. Have someone monitor the conversation to ask questions and take notes on the list of speakers, and have someone help or co-note.
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Spend your fitness expenses on dental care.
Join the #remoties line on Slack to talk to your colleagues about task sharing.
The HR business team is looking at a web-based outputs around the power guide to support the growth of distributed businesses across the foundation.
This week, we asked all community organizations that receive funding to suspend community events, such as the Wikimedia-sponsored Editors' Meeting, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We want to let them know that we understand that their demands for cancellation and other restrictions do not allow them to complete the tasks they have agreed upon and that no one should be punished for delaying or changing their intentions.
In the coming week, we will continue to follow up on additional guidelines on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
Common trends among communities around the world are sadness at the break-up, but relief when they can clearly focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and more.
Going forward, CRT is working to build a Meta-Wiki page for the community to monitor their interactions and their impact and follow-up.
Let's have some contact on COVID-19 related issues.
We are sending invitations to your calendars for the staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share more edits, answer your questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We will face this together and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to browse the information from this email and find all other unknown information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep the latest information on these pages and make sure that all information is available in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff living in countries where there have been recent significant outbreaks.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major career paths or insurance challenges, or any other assistance you may need, do not hesitate to let CRT know and cooperate.
We are ready to provide assistance and communication if needed.
If you have confidential or non-public matters, please email Bryan Juan: International Director of Human Resources, Worldwide Business Operations.
The government of the day is not responsible for any of these changes.
Instead, they seem to need recognition now, to accept their jobs and responsibilities in a way they never have in the past.
These are the things we believe in, and these things need to be mutually supportive, so that we can continue to work, and provide the help they need through our actions, and continue to provide the service they rely on in the world.
In time, their plans will come back to haunt them.
Now is the time to support each other and make room for the important work that will take place in the coming weeks and months.

b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is highly useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as it inhibits the activity of the related Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of Angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of Ang (1-7). ACE2 also acts as an intracellular gateway for some coronaviruses.
In humans, this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme-containing enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid transport domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein that interacts with its enzyme-activated domain on the surfaces of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the cell membrane-wide domain by another enzyme called sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein circulates in the blood and is eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most body tissues - ACE2 is mainly bound to the cell membrane of lung type II aviola cells, intestinal anthrocyte cells, arterial and venous membrane cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells in most body tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, a part of the brain that regulates hormones needed by the body, the nervous system, and the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates hormones, and the brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE antagonist.
ACE binds the hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels.
ACE2 subsequently cleaved carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) which was hydrolyzed into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also target many other receptors, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, aspirin, neurotensin, difenfenin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane-transference of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19, which has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
ACE2, a membrane-crossing protein, is a receptor site that acts as a key entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the fusion of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein in the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells can cause both the virus and the enzyme to enter and migrate into endothelial cells, where they are located.
This entry process is also required for the preparation of S protein by the host's progenitor protein TMPRSS2, which is currently being studied as a protein therapy. Some researchers have suggested that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several academic and regulatory bodies have recommended the continued use of standardized ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A review of systematic reviews and statistical data published on July 11, 2012, found that ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of pneumonia of up to 34% compared to comparative studies.
"In addition, ""especially in patients with stroke and heart disease who have an increased risk of lung disease, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of lung disease".
Although the results are inconclusive for all infectious causes of pneumonia, the use of ACE inhibitors may also reduce pneumonia-related mortality.
Human-derived gene-edited ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for severe lung damage and has been shown to induce an immune-boosting lipoprotein signaling response that improves pulmonary circulation and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory infection.
The 24-hour duration of action (duration) of the drug in a week, plus the time in the human body when less than half of the dose of rhACE2 is in the body, is approximately 10 hours and the time when the drug starts to work is 30 minutes.
Several findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a potential drug for people who are not resistant to simple renin-angiotensin system antibodies (RAS antibodies) or for patients with elevated circulating angiotensin II. Mixed rhACE2 has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to perform exposure tracking, i.e.: identifying people who have been exposed to and who have been exposed to the disease ("""Exposures"") in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic".
Many applications have been developed or proposed with the support of the official government in some territories and jurisdictions.
The main reason for this is that the user can easily access the app and use it to track their movements.
The security of personal information has been raised, especially with regard to systems that track users' geolocation.
Other ways that are less intrusive include using Bluetooth waves to record and store the distance of a user from other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple issued a joint statement that they would integrate the feature to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has developed an app that links to Alipay and allows citizens to use it to check for contact with COVID-19 patients.
It is already used in more than 200 cities in China.
The app was developed by a local community of IT professionals and will be made available for free and will be passed on to the government.StopKorona! is a Bluetooth-based app that has been launched in North Macedonia to track contact with infected people and help healthcare authorities respond quickly.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting confirmation from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"The government announced on April 12 that the development of a touch tracking app is in its final stages and will be available in a few weeks. Similar apps are planned in Ireland and France ("Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia aims to launch a geofencing app designed to ensure COVID-19 patients living in Moscow stay indoors.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of practical problems with application-based systems, including inefficiency and false validation when only a small percentage of the population uses an app.
To address concerns about the spread of "misleading or dangerous coronavirus"" apps, Apple has limited which categories of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, and only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations can add them.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed their concerns about the possible consequences of mass surveillance of people using coronavirus apps, especially if surveillance infrastructure created for surveillance of the coronavirus pandemic is removed once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for government projects.
The quarantine must be: legal, proportionate and proportionate.
The extension of the period of quarantine must include a legal provision that it should end automatically after a certain period.
The use of the information will be restricted to COVID-19 purposes.
The data security and anonymity must be protected and be based on evidence.
The digital surveillance system should be used to prevent further discrimination and exclusion.
The law should regulate the sharing of information with outside organizations and individuals.
The right to be heard and to be heard is a fundamental human right.
"The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published to-do lists".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of continuous surveillance by no longer requiring tracking and removing it from their device operating systems.
Some countries have used a network-based location tracking method instead of apps to eliminate the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
The Israeli government has confirmed that it is using a network of tracking devices.
The Internet-based solutions that can access location databases have significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have location information for individuals; many systems have been developed that use central servers for privacy-preserving purposes only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts with infected people.
Instead of using an app, the system collects information, including tracking data from various sources, including mobile devices, and card payment data, combines it and sends alerts via text messages to potential infected users.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location-based information publicly available, and since the outbreak of MERS in the country, there have been several changes to the information security law that allow this.
Many countries, including Germany, are considering using centralized systems to ensure privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, no details have been released.
Contact tracing, which protects personal information security, is a concept that has been substantiated by extensive research papers dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, several expert groups were working on appropriate solutions for personal information security, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's interactions with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized mitigation approaches, and is not a single procedure. Decentralized procedures include contact tracing that protects the security of decentralized personal data (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy-critical procedures and systems (PACT) for mobile communication tracking, and others.
In these procedures, personal identification information will be randomly verified only inside the device and will never be accessed outside the device.
A team at the MIT Media Lab is currently implementing SafePaths, a platform that allows for the use of proprietary methods when collecting location or routing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on data from a paper published in March 2020 titled "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Privacy in a Pandemic". Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that originally developed privacy technologies founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of their data.
The Global TCN Coalition was established on April 5, 2020, by groups that have brought together a basically similar approach and roughly identical procedures with the goal of reducing the disparity, a key role in achieving broad adoption, and developing globally co-usable tracking and alerting applications.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used in its official government app freely available.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a method for contact tracking. The method is based on a combination of Bluetooth low-power technology and a read/write encryption method to protect personal information, which they claim will protect the security of personal information.
They also published details of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the official launch of the system is planned in three stages:
Introducing tools to help governments create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect private information
To integrate the feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to first release the system through operating system updates, and then remove the system in a similar way once the threat threat is gone.
b'A drug re-designation (also known as drug re-targeting, re-labeling, re-targeting, or pathological modification) is the re-targeting of a drug that was approved to treat a different disease or medical condition than the one it was originally developed for.

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a potential vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The study was conducted in the United States, and the results were published in the journal Science.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available for 18 months.
In April, five vaccines were in Phase I safety trials.
COVID-19 was first detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread globally in 2020, leading to significant investment and research efforts to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published clones to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI announced that it was working on a critical initiative for vaccine production with speed, productivity, scale and availability worldwide.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that there were 10 different technology platforms in the research and implementation efforts they conducted in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine to fight COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have moved to Level I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage I carrier and designated vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Indicated dose for the virus (stage I carrier and designated vaccine: CanSino Biologics, indicated dose for adenovirus type 5)
A report by CEPI scientists in April found that a total of 115 new drugs are in the early development stages, with 78 active approved projects (79 according to Milken University) and 37 projects (presumably in the planning or design stages) that have been announced but have yet to be publicly disclosed (but with little information available to the public).
In determining more specifically effective drugs, Phase I-II trials are pre-trial safety and clinical trials that involve randomized controlled trials of ineffective artificial pills and a variety of settings.
While monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses, Phase III trials involve a larger number of participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease.
Of the 79 prescribed vaccines currently in development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (preliminary testing or research).

In March 2020, three US government, industry, and universities pooled resources to license supercomputers from IBM, in conjunction with computing resources from Hewlett Packard Interactive, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can reap benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
In Australia, another randomized trial is trying to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccine is being developed and is likely to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 treatments using specific animal models such as ACE2-breeding mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates have shown the need for international collaboration to ensure biosafety-level 3 containment and up-to-date safety procedures to address live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is no approved vaccine that can fight MERS.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was believed that current SARS research could be useful in finding vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are still being tested, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, consisting of two types: adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have circulated a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 is already known and that a vaccine already exists.
The patents, evidenced by various social media posts, cite genetic effects for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus and existing patents for vaccines.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, and nausea and vomiting.
The time of exposure to onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, but some develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ damage.
As of April 17, 2020, there were 2.24 million reported cases and more than 153,000 deaths in 210 countries and territories.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is transmitted among humans primarily through small droplets that often come from coughing, sneezing, or speaking, mainly during close contact.
The particles are released when breathing out, but usually do not travel long enough to reach the ground or surfaces.
Many people can get infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Although there is a possibility of infection in pre-symptomatic and later stages of the disease, the first three days after the onset of symptoms are the most acute. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasal and oral examinations.
The use of face masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Some authorities recommend against the use of masks, others recommend the use of masks, while other countries recommend them, with recommendations for the use of masks for the general public varying.
Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 against a specific virus.
Regional cases have been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, panic attacks, difficulty waking up, and ashes on the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Rare upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, sneezing or sore throat may also be seen.
The percentage of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, varied.
Some patients in China initially showed only convulsions and heart palpitations.
Some of them have been diagnosed with pneumonia, organ damage, and even death.
It's called the Silk Age.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of cases of symptomatic onset occur within 11.5 days of infection; reports indicate that not all infected individuals show symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic individuals in the infection is not fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may be the cause of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic cases is still under investigation, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases of the virus are asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began adding asymptomatic people to its daily case list on April 1. Of the 166 infected that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva and toothpaste can carry large amounts of the virus.
Talking out loud produces more fluid droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that unprotected coughing can cause small droplets of liquid to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not usually a particulate matter in the air, but the National Academy of Sciences has found RNA of the virus in oil samples from air compressors installed along corridors outside public rooms, which could be a bio-particle infection.
Medical procedures such as respiratory tracheostomy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) cause airborne particles of respiratory secretions to circulate in the air, causing airborne infection.
This risk is low when there is concern about possible infection through feces. The virus is most contagious during symptomatic stages. Infections can occur before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
Although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is transmitted, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that a person typically infects two to three other people.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive on cardboard for one day, plastic (polyprotein) and steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
When used correctly, soaps and detergents are also effective, as soap-based products not only break down the virus' fatty layer and render it inactive, but also make it less likely to be found on the skin and other surfaces.
Other fluids, such as benzalkonium chloride and clohexidine gluconate (an operating antibiotic), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, a saliva sample was obtained as an intermediate two days after initial hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral concentration, while the sixth patient showed the highest viral concentration on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a community of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All of the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus also occur in naturally occurring corresponding coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by blowing up a water tank protected by household soap.SARS-CoV-2 has a lot in common with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 as the virus enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most commonly found in type 2 AV cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a papilloma to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of people with the virus who are hospitalized have a sudden heart attack, which is more common in more severe cases.
In the progression of the disease, inflammatory response and immune system disorders are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular symptoms, but severe heart muscle damage may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are found at high levels in the heart and are involved in cardiac functions.
A high incidence of intravascular clots (31%) and intravascular clot congestion (25%) have been reported in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection, and may also be due to poor prognosis.Breast examinations of COVID-19 deaths have shown extensive abiotic damage (DAD) and intramuscular infiltration of fluid containing lymph cells into the lungs.
SARS-COV-2 has a disorientation for the epithelial cells that express ACE2 of the respiratory tract, but patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of a thick rash of skin redness throughout the body.
Specifically, the accumulation of inflammatory-associated IL-6-secreting monocytes in pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells has been linked to severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
In vitro studies have also reported the penetration of stem cells.
The WHO has published a number of testing procedures for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed with a respiratory sample obtained from a laboratory sample of the nasopharynx, but a nasopharynx or mucus sample may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require blood samples taken every two years, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists isolated the genome of the coronavirus and released its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently test polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, an antibody test (which can test for the presence of an existing infection and previously infected individuals) has been developed but is not yet widely available.
The Chinese experience with the test shows that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first care-site test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommend methods for diagnosis based on clinical indications and epidemiological risks.
Asymmetrical lateral lateral spread, with small glass fragments on either side of the lungs, and opaque patterns of spots are common in early infection.
As the disease progresses, it can lead to thickening of the upper lung mucosa, surface roughness (thickening of the interlucent lobe with irregular fillings of the gums) and stiffness.
There is little information available about the causes of microscopic lesions and the physiological-pathology of COVID-19.
The following are the main pathological findings of the tests:
The study of the blood in the lungs was conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
The following are four types of viral pneumonia that can be diagnosed:
Mild pneumonia: Infiltration of the lungs, proliferation of lymphocytes, abnormally large lymphocytes, inflammation of the lymph nodes, and formation of large cells with many nuclei.
Acute pneumonia: diffuse sputum discharge and diffuse sputum damage (DAD).
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
The treatment of pneumonia: the formation of fluid and pulmonary fibrosis from the avian ducts
The blood-vascular clot (DIC) and human choriocarcinoma
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a cloth when you cough or sneeze, and use a cloth inside your elbow if tissue is not available.
The report also recommends that the health of the population is improved by the use of antibiotics.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public places as part of its efforts to limit infections from asymptomatic individuals.Public distancing strategies aim to minimize exposure of infected individuals to other groups by closing schools and jobs, restricting travel, and eliminating large public gatherings.
Social distancing guidelines also include keeping at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from people.
There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, a key component of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the high incidence of infectious diseases, known as "curve-flattening".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are extremely dirty, before and after eating, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are readily available.For areas where commercially produced hand sanitizers are not available, WHO offers two formulas that can be produced locally.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used as an aid in the removal of bacterial spores. It is not an active chemical in the disinfection of the hands.
The hydration is achieved by adding glycerin.
People are managed by supply isolation, which includes fluid therapy, oxygen supply, and other vital organ support that may be affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to treat respiratory problems is still being investigated, but its benefits are still being studied.
The study also found that the use of antibiotics in the treatment of cancer was associated with a higher risk of infection.
Supportive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese Commission on Mental Health have published recommendations for the care and treatment of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Doctors of general practice and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various health departments on IBCC, an open source resource.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Preventive measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings where procedures that can expel airborne particles, such as inhalers or hand-held ventilators, are performed.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that they follow standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne particulate precautions, as well as patient isolation in an airborne particulate infection isolation unit (AIIR).
The following items are recommended: PPE suits, respirators or masks, eye shields, and medical gloves. When available, use respirators (instead of masks) as a priority.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial applications, but the FDA authorizes the use of face masks by way of an Emergency Use Authorization Order (EUA).
Although they are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air, there is no guarantee that they are effective against specific biological agents when used without the label.
The CDC recommends wearing face masks and advanced sleep masks when masks are not available.
Most people infected with COVID-19 are not so severely ill that they need a respirator or similar equipment, but only a few people need one.
This type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is currently being studied for many hospitalized people, and some evidence suggests that a small, or two-stage, high-flow nasal tube or a positive airway pressure tube can prevent the infusion.
It is not known whether either of these leads to the same benefits for people with chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer to live with a mechanical respirator with a high-invasive airflow compared to a high-flow nasal tube, if possible, because this method limits the spread of small particles that are dispersed in the air. Severe patients are more common in older people (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80).
In many developed countries, the health system's ability to deal with the sudden spike in the number of severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized is limited, and there are not enough individual hospital beds.
A Chinese study found that 5% of patients had to go to intensive care units, 2.3% needed a ventilator, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people with COVID-19 hospitalized are gradually admitted to ICU.
COVID-19 causes a sudden respiratory distress syndrome, which makes mechanized breathing more difficult as oxygen becomes more difficult to obtain.
Respirators and high PEEPs are needed that are capable of performing the pressure regulation modes needed to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing respirator-related lung damage and the possibility of pulmonary-to-thoracic ventilation.
The use of old respirators may not provide high PEEP.
The exploration of potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway on drugs that kill a number of pathogens.
Ramdev is the most promising candidate.
Although it may take until 2021 for a new drug to appear, many of the drugs that have been tested have already been approved for other uses and are in advanced trials.
In severe cases, antiviral drugs can be tried.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials to test the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted a temporary authorization to use sunflower plasma as an experimental treatment when a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
The clinical studies needed to show that it is safe and effective for this disease have not been completed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app also uses surveillance data to detect: close contact and potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine if a potential risk is detected, but also notifies local health officials. In South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, it uses a massive data analytics system on mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial memory technologies to track down infected people and contacts with those infected.
In March 2020, Israeli government security agencies were able to monitor cell phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
Measures are being taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may have been in contact with infected people.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared its collected phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to facilitate research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect people who are breaking the quarantine.
Giulio Gallera, the regional health commissioner in Italy, said he was told by mobile phone companies that 40% of the population was mobile in some way.
The German government held a 48-hour hack contest on Sunday with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid urged the world to develop solutions to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Many people may feel the effects of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are the perfect storm that threatens people's mental health and livelihoods".
The disease may have mild forms with few or no symptoms, as well as other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild patients usually recover in two weeks, while severe or severe patients take three to six weeks to recover.
Data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS suggest that pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there is no data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 infection can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), which can cause shortness of breath, hypertension, or various organ dysfunctions.
New complications associated with COVID-19 include hypertension, irregular blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting abnormalities, specifically elevated progesterone time (blood clotting time), were seen in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, and abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of that group.
It is estimated that 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the report, the median time from onset of symptoms to death is 10 days, with five days in the hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to ICU was seven days.
In the study of early cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days at a rate of 6 to 41 days for a full duration.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, compared to 1.7% for women.
Immunological tests of lung biopsies have shown widespread avian influenza damage with fibromyzoid secretions from cells in both lungs.
Viral-related intracellular mutations have been detected in lung cells.
The lung image is similar to the sudden respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart failure with elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest accounted for 11.8% of all deaths reported by China's National Health Commission.
According to March data from the US, 89% of hospitalizations are for people with the disease.Access to medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in a region also affect mortality rates.
Although estimates of the death rate by condition vary due to regional variations, there are also technical difficulties.
The report also highlights the need for a global approach to preventing and treating cancer.
However, the fact that the result is death for those who have been infected before may be an underestimate of the current mortality rate.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers, and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care and die.There are also concerns about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities say that in recovering patients, lung function decreases by 20 to 30%, and lung scans indicate organ damage.
It can also be a symptom of a previously treated ICU after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection had a long-term cure that was effective in those recovering from the disease.
Although resistance is possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, cases of recovery from COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported to subsequently be negative in coronavirus tests.
In these cases, the persistence of the infection is worse than the re-infection.
The virus may have a natural evolutionary pathway and may have evolved through animal origin.
Although the exact origin is unknown, as of December 2019, the disease was almost entirely human-to-human.
The study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients published in The Lancet in January 2020 listed the date of onset of the earliest symptoms as December 1, 2019.
The earliest known onset of symptoms was reported on December 8, 2019, in official WHO publications.
The number of deaths is usually measured by different measures.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and also depend on the number of tests, quality of health care, treatment options, when the initial outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
After 2019, when WHO defined codes for emergency ICD-10, laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as U07.1, and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection with a clinical test or epidemiological test that did not include laboratory confirmation were defined as U07.2. The case-to-case ratio is divided by the number of tested cases and the number of deaths in a given time period.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Numbers vary by region. Other measures include infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the total number of pathogenicity detected that has been killed by the disease, and infectious mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (positive and non-positive) that have died from the disease.
These figures are not time-bound, but are based on the exact number of people infected through the severity of the process.
Although not all infected people have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have already been infected.
The small village of Castiglione d'Adda, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, has 80 deaths (1.7%) out of its 4,600 inhabitants.
The carnival in Gangelt was a time of spread of disease and spread to young people, resulting in relatively few deaths, and no official definition of all COVID-19 deaths.
In addition, the German healthcare system is not sustainable.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of blood donors are estimated to have antibodies to the disease.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting death rate varies between men and women.
In studies in China and Italy, men had higher mortality rates.
The difference in end time between men and women is only 90%, and the highest risk for men is in men in their 50s.
In China, the male mortality rate is 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate is 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of the six differences is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower smoking rates, and the tendency to have comorbidities such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women all contribute to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of confirmed cases are men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not conducted a follow-up of gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Health workers, especially nurses, have a higher percentage of women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be COVID-19.
WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the date of the first detection of the outbreak was 31 December 2019, when the COVID-19 was identified as COVID-19, the virus in COVID-19, the disease in D and the virus in COVID-19.
In order to prevent blame, naming was done in accordance with international recommendations without reference to relevant geographic location (e.g., China), animal species, or population groups.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses the term COVID-19 virus and COVID-19 causing virus in public relations.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease, in line with 2015 guidelines against the use of viral names and epidemiological sites.
The official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in traditional distribution channels, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare products such as nasal sprays and respirators.
In one example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed a ventilator valve, the manufacturer couldn't supply it in time, so a small local company rebuilt and now produces 100 of the necessary valves overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake news about the origin, prevalence, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
It appears that humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a combined trial to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing pathogen-killing compounds that are considered the most effective.
Despite the lack of vaccine availability, various agencies are actively campaigning for vaccines.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells, using previous work done for SARS-CoV.
Three vaccine strategies are being tested.
For the first time, researchers are working to create a vaccine against the virus.
The use of an inactive or dying virus is intended to accelerate the human body's immune response to COVID-19 and new infections.
The second strategy, vaccines made from antibodies to the pathogen, aims to create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to produce some of the virus's antibodies back.
In SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, the research focused on the S-terminal protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative method for developing vaccines).
The experimental vaccines from these strategies will still be tested for safety and efficacy.The first trial of the vaccine with four volunteers was launched in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the pathogenic virus.Despite the suggestion of independent growth of immune antibodies as a potential challenge in vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, it remains controversial.
As of April 2020, there are reportedly over 300 clinical trials underway.
Many trials have examined approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
A report released in late April said that many countries were involved in nine Phase 3 trials of Ramdeciva, a re-targeted antiviral drug that is part of most Chinese research.
A continuing review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies was initiated in April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are under review, including ramdesivir, chloroquine, and hydrochlorothiazines, lopinavar/ritonavar, and lopinavar/ritonavar and interferon beta combinations.
In March 2020, the aim is to produce evidence of the efficacy of Ramdesivir.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with Ramdesivir, but has not yet been confirmed.
Phase 3 clinical trials are underway in the United States, Italy and China.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China with preliminary results in February 2020.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
Health authorities in Korea and China have endorsed the use of chloroquine.
However, the recommended daily intake is one gram, but Wuhan Virology notes that twice that amount is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the consensus of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The seventh Chinese guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifinova for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that large doses of antiviral drugs are needed to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in test tubes.
Following demonstration of low-concentration restriction of SARS-CoV-2, nitasozanide was recommended for further intramuscular study.Complete membrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the activation of SARS-CoV-2 via the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydrochlorophylline, with or without azithromycin, have major limitations that prevent the medical community from pursuing these therapies due to the lack of further studies.It is not known what role oxytamivir plays in the treatment of COVID-19 without an external inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2.
In the severe post-COVID-19 stages, a side effect known as a cytokine surge is often present.
There is evidence that hydrochloric acid may have anti-cytokine-stimulating properties. After a small study, the National Health Commission of China included tosalizumab in its therapeutic guidelines.
Italy is currently undergoing a national phase 2 non-clinical trial after people with severe disease were shown to have the virus.
Combined with plasma-removal blood tests to detect cytokine receptors (a symptom of inflammation caused by a reaction), it is intended to counteract these increases, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a review of case studies for the treatment of relapsing-remitting cytokine-producing syndromes and CAR T cell therapy for various causes.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial that suggests that tocilisumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified, fluid-filled antibodies produced by the immune systems of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a way to induce autoimmune status without vaccination.
This strategy was tested for SARS with vague results.
Viral attenuation is a highly anticipated activity as minimally invasive preventive antibody therapy can be used to combat SARS-CoV-2.
However, alternative methods such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis are possible.
Other forms of autoantibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are still being developed.
The production of Nalanta plasma, a fluid component of the blood of recovering patients, which contains antibodies specific to the virus, will be increased for faster practical use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
