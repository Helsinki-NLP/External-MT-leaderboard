Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years.
Washington has criticized Israel's continued settlement construction and accused Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The relationship between the two has deteriorated further as a result of the deal over Iran's nuclear program promoted by Obama.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of Republicans, which was interpreted in part as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been arranged with Obama, who had declined to meet with him in reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In a distress call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police in a slightly shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers had to come to his house.
Lamb said it was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and likely excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note scrawled on a white pad: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated in the letter, according to authorities, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where police say he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police surrounded him.
A day after the shooting at the university that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty consists of 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health issues.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard for would not guarantee him an automatic path to an assistant professor job.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he drove back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber handgun in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to the house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 people, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her to play the guitar for a few years.
He was the swarm of women back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and a resident of the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was absolutely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolute best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played the odd gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica in front of a sparse crowd.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humour.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshman program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
About 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial service on the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the distress call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in his distress call, but there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't be hiring as many Christmas seasonal staff as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 over the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin job interviews this month and will increase its headcount from October to December.
With the holidays months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees to sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his' date 'with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment professionally for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realised that the seat next to me was empty, and it was beginning to dawn on me that Princess Diana was going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it occurs to me that I'm a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg said, "it's indisputably the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
It regretted that divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they showed in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what it means for the real estate mogul's chances of winning the nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one is suggesting that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was surrendered to the ascendant Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a General Election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to pour their dollars into trying to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval ratings have rotated 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans viewed the real estate mogul favorably.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the start of August, it was 52 per cent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite, became the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News / Washington Post reported Monday.
The same number is true in the nation's first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN / ORC poll released last week.
That's a change from when four in 10 put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four in 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to just 28% for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even as Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September showed that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump commands majority support.
He has a 13-point lead over Carly Fiorina, a 14-point lead over Marco Rubio, a 15-point lead over Walker, a 19-point lead over Jeb Bush and a 33-point lead over Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll released Tuesday shows just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their ballots.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
Forty-six percent said they left the door open to switching to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competitor right now is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the forefront of public discourse about 2016.
Some worry that Trump's bombastic language will alienate crucial Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC / Post poll released Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will do the same.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half the support of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in the new ABC / Post Monday poll say they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with congressional Republicans, with 54 percent saying they are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent saying they are "dissatisfied."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square metre of a thatched roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt the supply of objects is naturally limited," it is called in the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student stand in Munich is not really a small amount.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, however, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square metre skyrocketing.
There are times several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But good if you can afford it...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Muller and Götze
Twice a goalscorer in Piraeus, Bayern star Thomas Muller simply has a run.
A fortunate goal from Thomas Muller paved the way for Bayern to a deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it was off.
A confident start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Muller and Mario Götze gave Bayern a dream start to their "Mission Milan" campaign in the cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at Greek champions Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double (52. / 90. + 2) and Götzes goal (89.) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth success in a row should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the trophy to Munich at the third attempt.
Muller, on his 28th goal for Bayern in the Champions League, was assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed a shot from the edge of the area to fly past him.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised hot-blooded fans before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium - and the Munich players kept their word.
They put on a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus has won its last six home matches in the Premier League, including against big-name clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1-3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup matches with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often started by shifting play to left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank from the right-hand side of midfield hit the top left corner of the goal.
The world champions went 2-0 up in the 67th minute.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chance of the first half.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the Pole's header off the line (26th).
Then by direct clearance, which goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians put up their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put pinpricks.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, was relied upon.
Like when he deflected a shot from Ideye over the crossbar (56th).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-man defence with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat out.
Sports director Matthias Sammer told Sky that the World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training session: "Anyone who wants to make something else out of it is evil."
Even at the first change, Guardiola opted against bringing on Kingsley Coman for the injured Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came on late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, with Müller adding another on the penalty spot.
There had been riots in the stadium before the game.
After a smaller group of partially masked Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was taken out of the stadium injured.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smoking causes damage not only to the lungs but also to the teeth, a long-term study in Potsdam suggests.
The good news: If you give up, the risk sinks quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the conclusion of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
According to the DIfE, tooth decay and inflammation of the gums are the main causes of tooth loss.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years before the risk drops back to the level of non-smokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England.
Study leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE explained that people need to be persuaded to become non-smokers: "Smoking shortens life expectancy."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous research has suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from Late Antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made once again on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists found what they were looking for.
From text documents it was already known that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the steeple, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman hit by freight train
After a young woman had an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police is asking the public for help.
Early on Wednesday morning at around 1.40am the woman was crossing the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she suffered serious injuries as a result of the capture of the train.
She was treated at the scene by emergency services and taken to hospital by paramedics.
The investigating officers have no information about the reason for the young woman's night-time crossing of the tracks.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Hints, which give information about the cause of the accident, can be given under around the clock switched and free Hotline of the federal police under telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to much more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to put in place a system that people trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
Specifically, the plans to reform current arbitration procedures foresee that EU countries and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are expected to come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also envisaged for the first time.
It would make it possible to appeal against judgments.
Up to now, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of appealing against their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it says it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
Investor-state arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly demanded by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that allows companies to seek damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws, or enforce lowering consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission took into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel and other EU Trade Ministers had worked out in the spring in the reform.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules restrict the business community's ability to take legal action.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be put at a disadvantage, it said.
It remained unclear on Wednesday when the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement was supposed to be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was sitting on stage in Cologne's Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy folk singer has marked the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost enthralled by Steven's lecture.
He tells the story of his meticulously and delicately arranged songs on the basis of various locations, which he draws again and again on the map.
Where they were made and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Stevens has since proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear, which nestle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can always drift into great opulence.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" was released and positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens makes a reduced appearance here.
Live, guitar and banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the musician, who lives in New York, returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely celebrated masterpiece is released in 2005.
Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album entered the American Billboard charts and is not missing from any annual best-seller list of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens makes extensive use of electronic set pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats, and plays with all sorts of effects and reverberations.
Long since abandoned the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
theater, he mainly presents "Carrie & Lowell," which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests now sit spellbound in their chairs, Stevens, who has matured considerably, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays their way through the broadly enriched album.
One hears from the audience: the lecture is "more opulent" and you can "basically throw away the record."
Only for one encore does Stevens say thank you modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Questions has been eagerly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs at close quarters.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and after his speech to the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences on the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piling up" within Labour after Mr Corbyn's comments on the European Union and limits on earnings.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" it was only opposed to government plans to cut the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron across the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the past decade since becoming Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said Prime Minister's Questions is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "posturing" and barb-fighting, and instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will replace him if he does not attend - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He has also floated the idea of other colleagues taking the floor occasionally, and that he has approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from "Punch and Judy" style politics, often associated with Prime Minister's Questions, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
First broadcast on television in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time was seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, though critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reform.
'Shot in Joburg ': Homeless teenagers trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place to be when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living from it.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped after data showed a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by bidding target SABMiller.
Earnings excluding bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% between May and July compared with the same period last year.
That percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided an estimate of when interest rates would rise.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the standout stock in the market, jumping 20 per cent after rival AB InBev's takeover bid was accepted.
A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are growing again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of £46.6m for the half-year.
The boss of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardising expansion.
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential customers."
But that spending power is unlikely to offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Läppische 21 years young, a hangover with an upper-chic hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros.
In fact, more than that.
Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the under-17s are going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
clock in the morning, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
Bieber's home: This is where her idol, whose posters have piled up in Szczecin, has lived since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mum Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says: "Actually, my Viktoria should be sitting in the tenth grade in the gymnasium."
'I'm fulfilling a dream for her. '
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He's sorted it out anyway.
He pocketed three million dollars for the ad during the Super Bowl commercial break, and a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company flushed many, many dollars into Bieber's account.
And for every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also cashes in.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window pane.
He is said to have plundered more than 100 million.
Some say the hype has gone too far.
Others point out that Bieber is currently at number one in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato donor idea
Potatoes or kebabs?
It works both ways - in the potato döner developed by Hani Alhay, the Oldenburg snack bar owner.
Inspired by the slogan "potato instead of kebab" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came to him from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of kebabs," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer stocked with meat and potatoes has been turning in his shop.
"This is multiculturalism for the stomach," Alhay says.
The Lebanese has since registered the idea with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected there as a utility model.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches grounding campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi surge in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and appliance wholesaler holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snatch away around 5 per cent of the grocery market in those two states 12 months after opening its first stores, taking sales away from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and grocery and volumes on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and grocery sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and to reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it is understood a Metcash board member made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43% since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and to help IGA retailers improve their stores by growing fresh food faster and providing a better choice of private label food.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says price adjustments and store refurbishment programs will pick up steam and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo often referred to as' Special Ks', came under the spotlight following Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the umpire, with Harrison exclaiming: 'Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios and I should have beaten him.'
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after cramp thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty angry about is the fact that I think Thanasi got dragged into the argument a little bit," Healy said.
He broke a racquet when he lost to cramp in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the US Open, even in the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision not to include Kyrgios in the crucial preliminary decider, which begins on Friday, describing the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assured the Canberra man he would return to the team as a long-term fixture. "
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the public eye, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. I think some time out of the spotlight, when he can only think about it, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of halting the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants massed in a no-man's-land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled the violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries, erecting tents and settling there.
But frustrations mounted.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary, while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in caught-off-guard Italy and Greece, expressing hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU states would take in a further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbours.
A state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after completing a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arrivals are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence that the government has built along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also stipulate higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
Let us be very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the military's deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a national security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carrying barbed wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pushed a crowd to get inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (up from 58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, has the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
With more than five months to go before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it's too early to tell which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost among a number of demographics, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now level.
Clinton still has a big lead among older voters, however.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead among that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the nominee.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their front-runner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the nominee, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cite her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement to deal with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
With the vice president weighing potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want him in the race - though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden leads.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election, but that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second by far in that measure, but the percentage who see him as the "most electable" has risen.
Still, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters cite questions about eligibility.
Much like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key traits among voters in their party's primaries.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best among the three candidates on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
By all those measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have a view of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as secretary of state, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their overall views.
But it's a different story in the American public at large.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was split in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their overall views of Clinton, though 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
While Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, it remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points lower since May.
Sixty-two percent of eligible voters do not consider her an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get high marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do best on honesty.
A majority view Sanders as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in latest CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half the support of voters in the new poll, and others are losing ground dramatically.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News debate to 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well among demographic groups, outperforming Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is tied with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson rising in the polls - landing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some swipes at the former neurosurgeon even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holidaymakers to still find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people are no longer going into the sea: the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees at the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five fraternity members charged with death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual at a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are being filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk across a frozen field toward a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide paraphernalia and put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the fraternity's harassment, with at least one student dying from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and forming a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to hold the individuals involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
That's what will happen if the Fed raises rates
A rate hike will come, and the bullish will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will all take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
As a result, US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should focus not on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period of time needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of" cheap money, "" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still too low to cause the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
As the market saw last month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after Fed rate hikes.
More specifically, for the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on an upward trajectory - about 14% - toward a rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6%), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on equities tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the yield starts to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Most remarkably, gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP has been below 4.5% only twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to last, and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could authorize a hike this session, futures trading indicates only a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all cycles of increases from 1950 to the present have occurred in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, dwarfing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
By contrast, this is a distinctly slow recovery from what has been the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and 74 months so far.
Fixed income has also been volatile, as the market anticipates a rate rise and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on equities when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / fall in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the raising cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often deliver better returns in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns," Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What's interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high levels of debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equities, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP criticised the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated The Brits
Fellow MP Damien Collins attacked the programme The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "morphing" into Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove it is doing something private broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster was "dumb" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" dumb "- but it seems to be morphing into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, only seem to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is way ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly second to none.
"And I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that audiences needed to work harder than they did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production to come under fire during the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee hearing for trampling on its commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was being produced 'in a special BBC way'.
He added that he hoped the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or spending taxpayers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose at slowest pace in August and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven per cent increase in online sales.
Last month saw the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales boosted by use of mobiles for shopping three years ago
Experts believe Black Friday in November slowed spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's high streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August showed the slowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five per cent year-on-year increase.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started using their phones to make purchases.
It meant more people could shop online and people could do it in different environments, such as on the sofa at home.
But now that is levelling off, and we may see growth slowing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been cited as one reason for the slump in sales.
Experts believe shoppers are holding back their purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rallied around their computers to snap up bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers battled it out for bargains, could deter shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in city centre fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames huge Saudi bin Laden group for collapse
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead began their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed when a crane toppled through Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands continuing to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have let the arm of the crane stop when it was not being used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report that detail, but said the company's leaders were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also rebuked the group for not taking up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has undertaken major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of any sane Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain hospitalized.
Government officials ordered 1 million riyals (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount to be paid to those permanently injured.
Other injured people will receive half that amount.
B & Q boss says the era of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores targeting artisans are opening
Meanwhile, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Correspondent For The Daily Mail
Brits are said to be abandoning hammers and brushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes
If you are adept at using a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock bottom prices had now passed.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at artisans and close 60 B & Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops as eight out of ten in-store shopping decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the majority of employees are men.
She said it was necessary to address growing demographic trends, which have more female single households making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There are still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 per cent of the decisions about buying items made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK FTSE 100-listed company, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 per cent of the team with women, including its chief executive and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Board of Directors.
Kingfisher reported a fall in half-year profits and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing its stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich / Dob officials on trial for infidelity
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich / Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion at the Regional Court of Klagenfurt.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that between 2006 and 2011, the defendants used funds from club accounts, over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes.
He puts the damage at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial misdemeanors.
This fact was eliminated by the President of the Senate of Judges, Judge Michaela Sanin.
Negotiations are due to take place at a later date.
In rejecting the infidelity, the defence argued that at no time had the club suffered any financial detriment.
The sports officials would have charged only expenses and taken the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Are we going to continue running the club or are we going to close it down?" said one of the defendants, who works as an auditor for the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurance policies in the bank as collateral," he said during questioning.
It was agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, the decision to pay the allowances had been taken retroactively up to 1991, subject to the corresponding financial success.
As a result, some of the allowances were not paid out until years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
This is why flat-rate deductions, rather than detailed deductions, appeared, the former chairman explained.
The accounts and passbooks were jointly managed by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial conduct, important was only the debt exemption, so the answer.
In 2011, when one official was investigated for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
Those were reserves, the defendants said.
This security account was in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge asked.
The interviewee did not know the answer to this question for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed it was best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about the money, the prosecutor said.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "reparation."
Why compensation?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
Thereupon the first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because no harm had ever been done to the club.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says: "You're all off the hook with this."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official also said he never received a penny in salary, only mileage and diets.
He had billed the club 1,000 euros a month for diets, but the actual outlay was much higher, he added.
Precise records for the early years were not available to the defendants.
These were no longer stored after an audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, they said.
The second defendant had also received mileage money.
All fixes were made in cash, and he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main hearing continues on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been underway for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs as it spins off the company.
There is no end to job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
The US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division as part of its restructuring.
This is expected to save 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros) in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will accrue from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 job cuts that have been ongoing for three years have not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year.
In after-hours trading, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent.
The company, based in Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up. The computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company before the end of the year - separate from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Recent disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have helped the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
Sales of PCs and printers fell 11.5 percent in the third quarter ended July.
Revenue fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenue fell in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to changes in the industry with a demerger and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has reacted belatedly to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans call for a total of about 55,000 job cuts.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be overwhelmingly opposed: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent in agreement.
61 percent approve of other countries flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of those surveyed are opposed to working with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, with 20 percent in favor.
Twenty-nine percent couldn't decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
Until 27 September, the focus of the fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electromobility.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects."
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organizers of the VDA Automobile Association expect around 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannon against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind them and a water cannon was at the ready behind the officers.
Forty to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
Officers used pepper spray continuously at first.
Police then used tear gas.
Lots of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
The group was thus disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat in a wait-and-see fashion.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the area.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half who believed as recently as last week that the Fed would do so now think the Fed will hold rates at their current level of 0-0.25 percent for a little longer.
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may be moving out of zero and starting a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned markets to brace themselves for a rise, but the signs are that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 20: 00 BST on Thursday
Delta State University shooter left letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "to make it undone," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, an assistant professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number about 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency services worker that police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house that "won't bother anyone," but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me. '
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he is not going to jail."
When police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in spring 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years
He battled leukaemia in 2001 and lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer in 2009.
The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa reorganizes the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 managers worldwide will lose their jobs as a result of the restructuring.
Negotiations are now under way with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute around 500 million euros a year to earnings from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have an Executive Board responsible for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the restructuring, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of its annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the pilots "association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the court-halted strike this Thursday.
The union said so.
Discussions will focus on the retirement arrangements for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a forecast record result."
The dispute between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of pilots, the background is the "Wings" savings concept.
It envisages Lufthansa outsourcing routes to the group's own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.
Paintings by Leena Krüger are on view in the Künstlerhaus under the title "Morning Train to the South."

Manchester United's Luke Shaw unable to play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat by PSV Eindhoven.
While that made the left winger cry and will rule him out of playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: 'He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital.'
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then he will have surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
He had an oxygen mask on in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture it will take six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee had got it wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: 'Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger.'
Related: Manchester United suffer loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an added incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: 'It is a very bad injury.'
When a player leaves the pitch with that kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard on himself because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: 'I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I am so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you are David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website, SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be an image or message that we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 film version, which adds new characters and details to augment the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. One love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads in part like a summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Though he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the money-grabbing, tree-felling, thunder-knitting monster despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, mustachioed creature "who speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low-key PR task was delegated to an aide who hadn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was supplied by Cameron's aides but gave no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly under threat of exclusion from England squad but it's still tough
Bumping into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my cards.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won't bear the scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth retires from England Test squad to be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
There have been two good attacks in his seven Tests in difficult conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If, hopefully, he scores more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come his way.
The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he wasn't performing so well and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man first and foremost.
The question of how much time a Test batsman is given to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism you can make is that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he's a batsman I rate highly.
He's an X-factor cricketer, as we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which hit us hard.
He needs to be given at least the same opportunities as those in front of him but, of course, that depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen bat alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and four quicks, popped up and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman can't bat there and this left-hander has already shown he's a good cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire but he's a No 3 for them and there's not much difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before he made his debut as an opener in 2001.
He scored three hundred runs straight away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me a lot as a young man.
People may look at his stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there aren't many backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the squad, England have made some smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a Test match consultant could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful input into the set-up.
I've always felt he's made for international cricket, as a player or a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can be a breath of fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what was said before.
Collymore's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is not used in the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no problem with that.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team leaders don't set the timetable.
And you have to remember that, as with players, their jobs depend on results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain leaving the EU) could gain momentum if the economy is in the doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in deeper trouble by the day, even without the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, which clashed fiercely over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply enmeshed in various crises as the EU is, and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-made agenda of divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes, most of which they do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual general meeting that it did not like them either if they jeopardised social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb into summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and suggests that more and more myopic ministers and civil servants in some capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before things get bad for her, as happened with the excessively long-suffering Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Francois Hollande looks ahead to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine them pulling out a leg to help the selfie-obsessed Brits, whose energies should be better spent trying to prevent Scotland's departure from the UK - something they also don't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some such ministers may even be deliberately planning unhelpful SNP-style remarks during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense, and which Eurosceptics are the oligarchy of press barons, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, which backed our entry in 1973 by a 2-to-1 margin.
You may recall Boris Johnson, the arch-Europhile who made his name as an "EU banana" Brussels correspondent in the early Nineties.
For all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-scaring rogues, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same of them, but found that if you're in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'd be better off distributing bananas to distract him, rather than having your lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair when he opposed Cameron's referendum gambit, because Blair had put the principle above the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is, shall I say, evolving.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-collar leanings and the wilder realms of Tory Little Englandism can probably say yes.
It's what Hilary "One Benn but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week, as the Scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the Seventies, when his elderly father made an effort on television to be disloyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his Cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more appealing.
But fighting to stay "at all costs" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC was telling his fellow MPs, according to all the reports at their Monday night retreat.
Whatever the mercurial bottom-up image of Corbyn - remember he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of round-the-clock TV and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in keeping with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC is not launching a Leave campaign - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already rather disappointed by the poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Tory government in power cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "policy report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "exceptionally windy basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in BMJ, two other researchers questioned whether the claims were "built on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They said the public expected PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive had previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed off on BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said he received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the panel's members are not given, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also cite industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco management.
Tellingly, the group's research "acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products by most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ's claims had been reacted to before.
He said: 'E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking.'
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but that we still need to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By clearly presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes, likely to be watched by a smaller audience, in fiercely contested time slots against the most popular shows of its rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea of the BBC commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Mr Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They are broadcasting The Voice in a prime time slot because they want the broadest possible support for its future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax would fund programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such programme, EastEnders is another, admittedly both.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think it would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes echo what Tony Ball, the former head of Sky, suggested in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more niche public service programmes "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion in broadcast fees," Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that no one has seen. "
They put them in a time slot where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get great value here, but for people who spend £150 is a lot of money, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's output was now officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take an example from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change that to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The minute nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that are too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new technique called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves that then enter the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to Optogenetics, a ground-breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapons video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a pugnacious parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: will you be travelling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the hallmarks of the DLR line, which are transformed into an image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be travelling with DLR... Customers are being asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys that are said to "gain access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this billboard "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists set to work with activists within protest movements, realizing that in order for their art to have an impact on society, they must go outside into the real world.
Another of the anti-gun-trafficking posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by advertising agency VCCP, which does not-for-profit work with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was taken aback by the silence surrounding the advertising for the gun show - through a blank space in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with inventing a more realistic, dodgy corporate advertisement, but "by blending it with bright colors and animation, it sticks more strongly."
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the British Government to step in and guarantee that torture equipment is not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a US Army order for "the shoulder-fired AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it's not going to be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student halls of residence
Eleven years ago, as a self-effacing 19-year-old, I moved into a dormitory, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student accommodation ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you're from, if and where you've taken sabbatical, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you identify the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and community hangouts, but they are also the places where people get dressed and straighten their underwear.
Related: Don't think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts get rough treatment at university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student halls of residence create a room-to-room wandering culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and text him instead of knocking on his door.
Talking of knocking, do it.
A bloke in my student halls of residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Making friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of baking mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies is less strange than greeting the 1950 "s" Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. "
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to put themselves to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls of residence.
Of course, chicken clawing is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll say they're self-sufficient, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my roommate, who added a washing-up liquid to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in jail.
You should not make any noise that prevents people from sleeping or working.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but that you are, in the true sense of the word, one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they mind turning down drum & bass a little bit because it's three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before letting her own music blaring, locking her door and going to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn't it be profoundly embarrassing if you had to take a roommate for your future spouse, approach her, separate again, and then have to see her every day and perhaps witness her pulling all the mutual friends over to you?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to instill some common sense in your abdomen.
The thrilling moment you realise someone has left their keys in their unlocked room is when the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Learn a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never spoil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't staple your belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the central Franconian corner valley for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees, for example - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how you can still build well and cheaply today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: in one project, he builds terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will enter the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because a large part of the people stay here.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, excluding land.
This is manageable.
It took six months to build.
That is appropriate.
Did building codes complicate their plans?
Gildner: Under construction law, I carried out my project correctly.
The threat of the sword of Damocles and the parking regulations always make it particularly complicated.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who manages three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there not enough space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need housing.
Not just refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I show how you can still build well and cheaply today.
That is the point.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
When it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message saying that the "software update failed."
To work around the issue, users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to upgrade via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could cause the update to abort.

Rosberg's only mistake was on full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in his fight for the world championship title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack."
The World Cup runner-up stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose."
Fifty-three points separate the runner-up ahead of this Sunday's night race in Singapore from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous 12 races of the season and is also favourite to win the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state.
The 30-year-old Briton won the race in 2009 and last year.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze has hung over the city, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for a cure.
Gauselmann is holder of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein.
Thus it is possible to accept chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quarter office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation is moving down from the mountain to the city centre.
To be more precise, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, seniors and those looking for advice receive information on questions such as long-term care insurance or benefits of health and nursing insurance funds.
For years, we have established with our outpatient care service that often carers are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Not infrequently, too, many benefits of the health insurance funds are not used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood any more," explained the new landlord, Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the department for geriatric care.
In addition to consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore one can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described it as "the Senior Care Centre."
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular as demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration ceremony, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social get-together."
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to enabling seniors to live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings as possible.
The accommodation office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9: 00 to 14: 00, Tuesday and Thursday from 16: 00 to 18: 00 and Saturday from 10: 00 to 12: 00.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division Würzburg Kickers had not yet been set, now the 6th October has been set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the second round of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third division club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally scheduled.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7 pm in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also refers to the now started ticket sales.
It is something special for our team to play against a third division team.
We therefore hope for a large number of spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight plays have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg reached the round of the last 16 in 2010 by winning the regional league 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5,000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016 / 2017.
Defending champion is relegated from the third division SSV Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to furnish the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking fine: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese did not stand out in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
He claims to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not gained weight.
Wiese was having his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking attendant outside issuing a fine for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the female officer and threw the fine due at her feet, the Bild newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under investigation," the city of Bremen said.
Only then will a decision be made on whether or not to prosecute Wiese.

Men beat 17-year-old Afghan man
Police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11.45 p.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden on foot in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and shouted at them to wait for him, according to police.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people in the petrol station area.
One of the men then yelled at the teenager and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding profusely from the nose.
When his two friends rushed over and appeased the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man has now been brought home by his friends.
The offender pursued the group to their home in a car and drove past several times.
When the vehicle could no longer be seen, the injured man went outside to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male.
They used a baton to beat the victim's face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical attention.
So far there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 6ft tall.
The second thug is said to have been about 6ft tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt.
Police are appealing for witnesses and whistleblowers to contact them at 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The Mayor of the Velvet Community Bernd Bormann, Uta Seim-Schwartz and Heinfried Kabbert, the mayor of Asendorf, are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country there are no doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice there on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is standing by his successor with half a job in the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, by which time he will have invested 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens got to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago. She is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and plans to join the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time came, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of soon being his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The father of two, Frank Müller, grew up there; his medical studies in Hanover were followed by stints in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is involved in volunteering for the Bruchhausen-Vilsen DRC.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specialises in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to establish themselves as family doctors.
"That's why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound scans as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more consultation room.
In addition, the IT system will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a subsidy of a total of 50,000 euros from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the joint municipality (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, compared to about 500 in the average practice in northern Germany.
There is another GP practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
By the way, those who visit Müller's office will continue to look into familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaner from the Felstehaus will take over.
Their departure marks the end of an era in Asendorf, after all, the medical profession practised there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen with a smile.
She already feels a little melancholy after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and I am sure we will see many more patients," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6,000-square-foot property."
'I've always shied away from gardening, now it could be different. '
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy travelling.
Croatia: "We will let the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be ramped up at our southern border," said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Minister of the Interior.
In parallel, controls at the Hungarian border remain in place.
It was still clear that anyone wishing to apply for asylum could do so "as a matter of course."
The care and safety of the people is the main priority.
But it is also clear that "clear signals are needed," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to travel on towards Austria and Germany and, if necessary, to set up corridors for the refugees.
Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana, however, did not see it quite that way.
He said the idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable" and that Slovenia would step up border controls, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, as the external border of the Schengen area, is already tightly controlled.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in the early hours of Tuesday in order to evade registration.
Croatian police were able to apprehend them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, ever since.
They were predominantly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already deployed.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were also diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to," it was said.
According to media reports, the first bus carrying around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected later in the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border some 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary had closed down, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which observers had already predicted, to a slightly more western route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive possibilities for border control."
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and EU partners have consistently given Slovenia a good record on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm the situation on Wednesday morning at a local inspection in Horgos, saying that the debates on alternative routes for refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, were premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It was not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers advise migrants on - dangerous - alternative routes
However, Hungarian private aid workers have already started distributing maps to refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
Crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not without its dangers: 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, minefields still remain uncleared in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of deminers had been sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly accessing previously unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The stolen information is said to have been used to conduct insider trades on the financial markets.
In total, more than $100 million was extorted in this way, according to investigators.
"Today's settlement shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," the SEC statement said.
The trials of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have operated both in the US and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes fast paced, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You will head to the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Light rail.
Pulsating, bustling life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the headline "Before I die I want to...."
With this action, Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The director of Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions, as are the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously pick up the chalk and add the phrase "affirm my life," "be able to read," "ride a camper through the USA," "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long," others stop for a moment, read, say phrases such as "I'm not that far yet" and then move on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the fringes about the action itself, about life, how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Mannheim Deaconry Society, which, together with the Caritas Association, is the sponsor of Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
That is why this publicity campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
It is understandable, however, that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, as it is a very personal matter.
According to the experience of Josefine Lammer, the topic of death and dying is still taboo, even though the hospice movement in particular has contributed a great deal in recent years to people opening up.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The bereavement and bereavement counsellor is one of the first to volunteer.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by appeal, it immediately responded and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany sufferers and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the Saint Vincent Hospice.
They are all thoroughly trained.
Angelika Godefroid knows how to handle her task and the experiences she has made.
"I see life from a different perspective, consider it precious and cherish the moment," she says.
The outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
Financial support from health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations facilitates the training, training and supervision of death and bereavement counsellors.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted down on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its full-year profit outlook because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases averaging 4.9 percent, which take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground shipments of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expected earnings to rise year-on-year due to cost cutting, higher revenue and growth in online retailing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "delivering solid earnings considering weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, just short of the $2.44 per share that 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
Ground transportation revenue rose 29 percent in the most recent quarter, but operating income was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with an 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 per cent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the ornate two-story courtroom, is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests before all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict, with Thursday's announcement on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most economic data show solid growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials fearful of heightening that volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of economists polled recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a hike.
This points to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another hike is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point, "he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to reassure financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected the rate to rise this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market this year has been solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, although inflation has been consistently below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed officials said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tight labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world flinched late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% from its peak in May as investors worried that a slowdown in China's economy would slow global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below its May high.
For Fed officials, the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past couple of weeks had not occurred, they would be tightening the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts it will wait at least a month to better manage the impact.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there's almost no reliable data to describe developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee that advocates a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited discernible impact on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The recent turmoil is not coming close to that level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into a situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting excited," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The store / warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a one stop shop offering a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious ornaments and Christmas decorations.
There is even an auto department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to wander through the aisles.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What's on here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even roast it for you if desired.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangale, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, natural pig intestine, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong durian next to the checkout.
Where it's located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is busy, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Providing them with a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a whole range of people who selflessly support asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even at 74, she still enjoys teaching.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Strasse.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different from teaching in a real school.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during lactation by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects their babies "genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exceptions for the new sports hall in Bernried
The Bernried municipal council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar systems.
Plans for the long-awaited sports hall construction at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step. At the most recent council meeting, the construction proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Prior to this, the committee had decided, among other things, on an application for an "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid development plan under building law.
The "exception" was the permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
According to this, a "gable roof with non-central ridge and roof projection" is to be erected.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar power plants: "This will give us a wonderfully large south-facing roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the pitch of the roof, which for energy reasons - contrary to the zoning plan - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "exemption" became necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the pitch of the roof - whereby the Bernried municipal council generally proceeds rather restrictively with exemption applications.
However, gym construction is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The sports hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros in costs have been factored in.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sport funding.
In the next procedural step, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the district administration office for consideration.
Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
Peißenberg Hospital is to close earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided by the surprising plans of the Krankenhaus GmbH of the district, which district councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision on this would be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
Should the plans be implemented, then all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who are unable to travel to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees were informed of the plans, he said.
The change was triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When it came to the question of who should succeed Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play. He agreed to take over the management from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine," according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer specialises in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological diseases on the Inner Ward.
If the Supervisory Board agrees to this, Fischer and his team will manage both houses temporarily for the next two years, until next year when the former hospital in Peißenberg, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed for good after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing refurbishment at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I rule that out." Jochner-Weiß was not able to say how things are going with the property, saying that there are several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care unit of Caritas and a day psychiatric unit are housed there.
"Something better could not have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech, which was received "positively and very sympathetically" by the employees.
There was no real prospect for the house, where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for more than 30 years.
He had been asked by colleagues in Schongau to take over the position of medical director.
The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are challenged tonight (8.15 pm) at the Bergisches HC.
The Bundesliga championship leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season they suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have to make amends there.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a maize field near Pratau (district of Wittenberg) several hunters were in action, according to the police.
A 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries after being shot and were taken to hospital.
It was initially unclear exactly how the accident could have happened.
Forensic police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crime
A suspect has led police to the body of a 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday.
Under questioning, the 20-year-old admitted killing the teenager and dumping her body in a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the public prosecutor's office and police said on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old man, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, is believed to have confessed to the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she failed to return home as planned the previous evening after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, investigators first came across the victim's personal belongings.
Questions among friends and acquaintances of the missing eventually led to a suspicion of the crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged offender then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested man admitted during police questioning that he killed the 16-year-old and dumped her body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to appear before a magistrate on Wednesday but investigators have charged him with manslaughter.
Further investigations are expected to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking affordable housing.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income residents for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing Alliance."
By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
That leaves 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception centre.
Many then hit the housing market and joined the long queues outside rented homes.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is running a housing deficit that is getting bigger by the year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units are already missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
For this reason, many working people in large cities were forced to live in shared rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in "Hotel Mama" because of the housing slump.
In the major cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance is proposing a new start.
New incentives are expected to boost social housing.
Thus the real estate transfer tax could be dispensed with and the real estate tax for subsidised dwellings temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening, at 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is practically no way through to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia intends to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior and, if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set off for Croatia in order to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees the previous day.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures practically superfluous in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for that possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police intercepted the first refugees at the border of Serbia with neighbouring EU country Croatia.
Most were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
But the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine sweepers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people apprehended.
Shortly before the closing on Monday, there were 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings have therefore been opened in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Department, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the main Röszke crossing.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of being granted asylum in Hungary any more.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also stepped up border controls.
But around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the orders of the German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived in Freilassing on foot.
Mayor drove 'stranded' across border
"We were cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, it was all over for them in Wernstein, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people over the border to nearby Passau together with two other helpers and their cars.
Before that, we catered for the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said straight away that we would bring them to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
One man couldn't resist handing over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased with that," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had changed from an ICE train in Wels to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening, in order to try to cross the border after the announcement that rail services to Germany had been suspended at short notice.
The regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border aspect is generally very popular.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday socially, the day before a two-bridge athletic run - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of hypocritical politics:
Instead of immediately helping to set up humanitarian structures in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has officially and publicly cast the attitude of the Hungarian Government into the shadows of National Socialism.
It is not only the Austrians who are suffering as a result of this policy who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
Refugees, too, will find that the "promised land," which has invited and welcomed them, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
In view of the continuing influx of refugees and the approaching winter, it will be a great challenge for us to establish humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winterproof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has appointed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the initial reception centre in Traiskirchen.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday was also carried out without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organisational "masterstroke."
The Home Office, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
Konrad expects a total of 85,000 quarters to be needed this year.
In order to meet the figure, 35,000 more accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the provincial governors.
They had assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"Things are going well in Upper Austria," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP-mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to find out how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations for the ORF campaign "Helping like us."
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
There are also hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards of accommodation as "very high."
In times of emergency, it cannot be the case that accommodation providers have to adhere to a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a limited period of time.
Konrad explains that, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful with accommodation, based on his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth to his face.
Persuasion was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not impose any costs on the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there appear to be problems with the permit.
Linz Calls for a Better Distribution
For the time being, the City of Linz is not planning to open up municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is currently not necessary, since the people affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, further sites will be tested for their suitability.
The city chief criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also play their part.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the further steps to be taken on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that Germany's borders will not be sealed.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called on the other EU member states to show greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" shipyard in Linz's Industriezeile has been officially completed.
The listed IT group S & T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, with the remainder (2,700 square metres) to be let to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
S & T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours right from the start - something Niederhauser hopes for: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
S & T invested 1.7 million euros in the site and 3.3 million euros in the Techcenter, which belongs to one third each of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
Linz AG has leased the building to S & T and Techcenter for 60 years.
Thirty percent of the 2,700 square meters of residual space in the building is already rented out, and there are enquiries for a further 40 percent.
Lia Peroni owner opens second shop in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually Jutta Breit wanted to buy a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project without further ado: after all, she has now gained additional business in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Prior to that it was rebuilt for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another shop," says Breit.
Decisive for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots herself.
Broad has inherited her fashion interest from her mother.
What suits me the most is when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women fall into rapture at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert cannot answer with last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called pretenders.
This trait is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump, 69, is always good for excitement.
Whether he speaks out against xenophobia, rudely attacks journalists, or exposes gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics, the candidate for the US presidency is stirring up the election campaign.
And is doing well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire's grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the haircut is known to many in the wine village on the Wine Route.
Some in the 1,200-inhabitant town is related to him over-tens of corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do villagers think of his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way," says Simone Wendel.
A native of Kallstadt, she has made an amusing documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not make it there to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family's accomplishments, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of showmen.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his future grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold miners in the USA.
The foundation of the real estate group were the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of their grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed because of the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
The director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, said he did not take Trump in because he had once left without permission.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for building a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he rumbles, it's not so likeable," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was born Trump, grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American as rather aloof, "he is always so effervescent."
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
'He's never bothered about Kallstadt. '
Like many a Kallstadter, Veronika Schramm mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine the Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
She would prefer he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's a good thing."
If those in charge in the US at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have got there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will ripen even without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed at length, has been seen by 12,000 moviegoers and is attracting interest in the US as well.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village."
Ludwig Wucherpfennig, vice-president of the German Alpine Club, presented the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park with the award for sustainable tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take the lead on the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there has been no major shift in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital as Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows that included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That gap didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase over Monday's ratings (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but its numbers fell short of last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
The first half hour of The Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers on Monday night and a whopping 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-seat averages 620,000.
The drop in ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to outdo the McGuire's show.

The final three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ended up with on The Bachelor has been shrouded in the utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But as we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three turned into two, you may have inadvertently given a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed ahead of Thursday's finale
All three women have spoken out about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should receive Woods's last rose?," their answers could become the spoiler as to who won The Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name Mackay as Wood's best mate.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
'Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her, 'Markoski added.
I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realised that this is obviously not just a game - I'm fully attuned to him now," she said.
And when asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was baffled.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air on Ten on Wednesday at 7.30pm.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams who sent enquiries after his impressive open workout late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have relegated Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a tussle like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne punches a punt recovered in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field swearing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was one thing that happens, you just worry about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
All in all, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian tarmac.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company seized, and his democratic efforts thwarted.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn recess in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavarian schools if there are no new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will have distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, very different main themes were foreseen.
But record numbers of refugees are now dominating the free-for-all.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overshadow the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN safe zones for refugees in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.
"It's not going to go on like this, we have to get to the root causes," the Liberal Democrat leader said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to be deported as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The head of FW criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states throughout Germany."
'Bayern are pushing, others aren't. '
'That's where we need to be more effective. '
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
One long-running issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot experiment "Middle Level Plus" at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the middle level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it takes another nine years until the Abitur.
But that doesn't go far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated," said the head of FW.
We demand freedom of choice for all grammar schools who want it.
Free access to the G9 wherever it is desired.
Tighter Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market closed with gains after a largely directionless and nervous trading session.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start to the US stock markets provide a clear direction, which ultimately propelled the Dax up 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The mid-cap MDax gained 0.54 per cent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Many stockbrokers expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the U.S. and also to the big fall on the futures exchanges this Friday.
The discussion about the burden of the nuclear phase-out has meanwhile pushed RWE shares to a record low and has also left a deep mark on Eon.
According to Der Spiegel, the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The German government denied the figures quoted in the press.
Shares in Germany's two largest energy groups recovered somewhat, but ended up losing 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
A positive report from US investor magazine Barron's at the weekend had an impact, according to one trader.
Accordingly, investors paid too little attention to the German chipmaker at present.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and a focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt.
Shares of carmakers Daimler and BMW rose 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.
Volkswagen shares rose 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the outstanding yield on listed German government securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex bond index rose 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund futures lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro fell to $1.1262 in the afternoon.
By midday, the European Central Bank had set the benchmark rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 killed after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since Oct.
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step toward a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in Kathmandu's draft constitution, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Building site planned in the city
The property near the Youth Centre Alte Post in Emder is to be developed again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000-square-meter space.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square metre property in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of retail, commercial and residential purposes.
The city says it is awaiting offers.
It was not yet clear which investor would be eligible.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located at the corner of Ringstrasse and Grosse Strasse, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home development at the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
Some residents remain concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure centre
For months, negotiations, brooding, debating and drawing had been taking place behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday house settlement at the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emde company "System-Bau," presented its plans to the public for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Emde Council.
Originally, this item was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But he said it was good to be able to counter all the rumours now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among sea stall owners who came to the meeting evoked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the sea stall and member of the board of the local residents "advocacy group Pro Hieve, complains:" This is going to be a huge block that towers over all the other buildings. "
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that the intended size of the plant would lead to a significant increase in traffic: "Entire bus loads have to come in to make this pay off," says Schulz.
Exactly what is happening on the one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open, however.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin cubs with gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt Zoo is delighted to welcome young gorillas.
Dian, 26, gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as mother Dian has been keeping them close to their bodies.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted Tuesday a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Doubling Donations Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a $11 million donation campaign for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries that have overwhelmed European nations.
Google has taken an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation appeal on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first donations raised globally will double to $11 million, up from $5.5 million on google.com / googlerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused largely by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show anything," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight-loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries, or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been done in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tubing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent the surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved their diabetes and 28% partially.
In comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes completely dissolved in only one percent and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent), and was more likely to overcome diabetes completely (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit in the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse. '
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and the latter falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recently published novel "Actually we are not like this."
Beyond the love story, the novel should be of particular interest to readers of Hunsrück, as it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to erect a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to take precedence over the interests of individual nations or even continents in these circumstances.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not proportionate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in overcoming the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to build real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce homicides in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attack, noting that the violent US response led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence and that brought unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in hand sanitizer use by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer use in children under 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a social media backlash.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey standing around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of kids, and when kids get to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was 179, twice the legal limit for an adult to be drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and to keep hand sanitizers out of the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three New York State fourth-graders planned to poison their "mean" teacher by putting antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned her from her room.
Police deemed the foiled plan "chatter" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old motorist has been slightly injured in a rear-end collision on the crossbar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver was driving on the crossbar towards the roundabout and realised too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
He then crashed his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed the vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
Damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to around 10,000 euros, police say.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed away.
Rumour Mill: No disharmony at Celtic

Dons extend lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, leaving the Dons with a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not under increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're feeling pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of title challenge in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show highlights of Celtic games any more and why?"
It's because Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to turn things around," Deila vowed.
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic have to fight but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, who are now five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad times before and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing new signings and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss said: 'The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.'
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate, which you have seen with our own group this season.
The squad is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu given retrospective warning
Swansea striker Michu, in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he could retire when his contract at the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued by a troublesome ankle for two years and failed to make the Wales squad this summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - Collum's third red card in eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, insisting: "I have not questioned any integrity, I have not commented on any performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice board have faith in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists the Dundee United board still have faith in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch.

We're going to get the guys back on their toes, "Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see off a seventh successive league win that gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn't won games like this."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising across the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK's of 5.5 per cent, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of people employed now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with employment increasing and unemployment falling.
Drunks disrupted proceedings
Since the security personnel could not calm the situation, the employees called the police.
It was only with the use of pepper spray that officers were able to take the troublemakers into custody.
A breath-alcohol test showed a 16-year-old with 0.89 per mille.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old man had a blood alcohol reading of 2.15 and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will be sitting in a gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in the US, and with more applications than seats often available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it without emotion.
I can't.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she 'could have put it better' but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go into all the details here.
I cannot say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to get out of Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's attempt to contact police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy water just metres away from a police officer who tried to 'gently persuade him to return to shore'.
Canning Vale Police were called to a trespass incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "a good cop negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins provides an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid an alcohol test and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to quit racing
Peter Moody claims Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy at his stables last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He took aim at the stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, claiming they waged a personal campaign against him by late scratching Lady Tatai for race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in difficult circumstances when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample from Lidaris, which he could not explain.
He had held back for 18 months on the espionage charges and didn't want it to "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start to think I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach any more.
I then have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a cheat.
If that is the case, surely they should grasp at their noses because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they will have to take my licence away and disown me, and I have no doubt that what I am saying will make them think about it now.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led to him saying he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, in violation of the rules.
'It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to my leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, and it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for handling the package on race day and an investigation has been opened into the matter.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all recognise that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's getaway
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver getaway at Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Motorway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove on without stopping to help the injured driver.
A 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to police in Shepparton on Monday.
He is expected to be charged with driving while disqualified and failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as an "agenda setting" by two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees had allowed the Storm players to "wrestle" with his team during the Storm's heavy win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team's final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "prime example" of rugby league and saying the Queensland pair were not "too good" at wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's handling of the tackle, saying they were only focused on their "contact."
Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two senior coaches made him feel confident because it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps cropping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year, but in the last six weeks we have made contact in tackles a real focus and that has turned the tide for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how it keeps coming back at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team and Wayne said he would do a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and we see that as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have those kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
I'm building more confidence because they say these things, because they're a little bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm v Roosters game had a higher score than the Broncos v Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the fixtures.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some stage.
The Storm team is off this weekend, having won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which sailed from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he attempted to possess the entire quantity and that the cafe may have been for a harmless reason.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about the risk of Maksimovic fleeing.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 bail as collateral to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Justice Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from turning up, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and adhere to a curfew of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cab of the car involved in the accident completely tore apart.
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for more than six hours until 2 am.
Damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure paedophiles into sending pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up to discover the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police looked at the five images, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches using terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it because it would "lead to paedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: 'He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted the searches on the computer were carried out by him but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to entice her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: 'When the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of taking indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breaching the conditions on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear on the register of sex offenders, arguing there was "no significant sexual element" in his offending.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in that case but has been remanded in custody pending hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders' register before the sentencing date.
Smugglers evade small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being apprehended away from the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of detection and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the Inn River, more than 1,000 refugees have been intercepted in the counties of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and weirs.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to Federal Police figures, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich's main train station on Wednesday than at the start of the week.
By 8am alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said.
Following the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1,759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of Tropical Storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists are warning of gale force winds in the southwest by Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm ocean air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The powerful low is the offshoot of Tropical Storm Henry, which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can also be expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance region until Thursday morning.
On Friday, therefore, the sun can be seen again for longer.
The masses do it: every two years, the automakers present their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well, are showing signs of movement.
Compact class cars are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone were in this segment.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new luxury and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at dealerships in the fall.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Group CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It is at the heart of the brand.
To ensure that the high-volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel holds out the prospect of entering below its biggest competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from Euro 16,990.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, Hesse also offers diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike its main competitors, the VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra will initially only be available as a five-door model.
The second variant will be the station wagon, which will also be on show at the IAA in the spring.
And in addition to the Astra, what other compact cars will be shown at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the show, the Mégane will be presented exclusively as a five-door model in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
It will go on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as an estate car.
Infiniti: Brand new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to establish its position in the fast-growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fits perfectly into the brand's design line.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: Another new addition to the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno will go on sale in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the classy Citroën offshoot focused on the front end: here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system in particular has been modernised, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touch screen and Apple's CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, the compact class will be joined at the IAA by a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favour of an ex-prisoner of the Tegel penitentiary, who was housed for months in a cell that was too small.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked up in the too narrow rooms for only a few days (file no.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: Between June and November 2009, he was housed in a solitary cell in the Berlin-Tegel penitentiary with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not physically separated.
The man, who has since been released, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.
His suit against the state of Berlin for official liability because of the undignified conditions of detention failed.
But the constitutional judges overturned the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appeal and dismissed the case there for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of the man being violated.
Court of Appeal now decides on amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days "detention from the period in question is decisive for compensation, a claim for compensation is made, it was stated.
Otherwise, "a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation.
Constitutional judges have often in the past strengthened the rights of prisoners.
As recently as April, for example, they awarded damages to an inmate for being locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of human beings.
On Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inhumane accommodation for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The plaintiff at that time was accommodated daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a cell of the same type as in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin's prisons have also hit the headlines in recent weeks for a lack of staff.
As a result, prisoners are locked up for 23 hours, aggression increases, and even brawls are said to have taken place because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 vacancies in Tegel are unfilled due to a shortage of young talent, with 19 due to be axed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Refugee immigration is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to embrace it.
What lies ahead for Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year; according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even in a position to take in one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we can do it."
The following overview provides an overview of what is to come for Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments will be needed annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 homes).
However, the shortage of housing is particularly dramatic in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units a year are excluded from fixed rents, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
In the view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units per year would have to be built, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion euros per year to achieve this.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on refugees working to the recognition of work.
While previously there was a ban on asylum seekers working for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority view has prevailed - partly because of the shortage of skilled labour - that refugees should be given quicker access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
To date, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and occupation-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through face-to-face contact.
The structure of networks is therefore in the opinion of Thränhardt the king way to the work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has determined that only a few refugee parents send their children to daycare, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the kindergarten, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
If the need for educators were to increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
As a matter of principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or asylum seekers from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Access to higher education could be made easier for refugees wishing to study.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefit Act when they begin their studies.
The latter do not receive a Bafög as a matter of principle, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to Bafög.
Until now, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög. From 1 January 2016, this period will be shortened to 15 months.
Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union are calling for this funding gap to be closed.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that would take professional care of the new arrivals.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear interlocutors and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant it certain possibilities of control.
This includes a willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to hold such conflicts in Germany "immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be an issue for society as a whole, even more so than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the dismantling of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - had an Anti-Discrimination Agency and a General Gender Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time, and what international conventions such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"In terms of man power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery is calling for health cards to be issued to all arrivals at the time of registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to fatten so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided for by the Asylum Seeker Benefit Act.
Otherwise, language barriers are the main problem for doctors.
Already so far, so proved the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctors "offices interpreting costs would have to be covered, she demands.
In addition, many refugees would be helped already with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, Montgomery believes that German doctors can cope with the partly different clinical conditions from their training.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even bring relief in sight.
Syrians have a sophisticated education system, and some refugees are even doctors, he said.
In order to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take another exam.
According to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatised.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, racing heart and fear of death, among other things.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, severe anxiety and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services departments, caseworkers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion," Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the arena on the Ziegelwasen.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal trainer and junior boss.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current stage production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift to inspire is therefore in the family's blood.
"It is important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them for two hours into a completely different world," stresses the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manege cocktail with cosmopolitan flair," is how Director Reinhard Probst describes his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus impresses with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded an award at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers know their craft, too.
The Cuban duo wants to take on the heroes of the silent films with ease.
Lightness and agility - these are the words they identify with.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to capture women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salvoes of laughter, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with tact and agility.
Balancing on a ball with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is more familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics than few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the keeping of circus animals are all too often the subject of discussion in various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caress.
The "four-legged artists," as they are affectionately called, are able to read every wish from their eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to enter the ring.
The first commandment, then, is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is especially proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mix of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals have lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, there was our little jumbo," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the arena yet, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are wholeheartedly involved."
The Circus Probst invites to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 5 pm.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes fake speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the incident quickly went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with boos.
Last month, they booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address to Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that does not appear, but it is entitled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that their parliamentary immunity expires in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity ceases to be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company's restructuring and cost-cutting efforts.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a company statement.
It splits up a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
That optimistic scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is surely still uncertain.
The great shame about this current problem is that Wilshere finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old self during pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the inherent risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
An unpleasant pattern is also developing.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 separate incidents involving Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rates over last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury you have a vulnerable period, a period where you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident he will and he will have a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger envisions a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating grounds in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games, having started the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with a magnitude of 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal learned the lessons of last season's Champions League capitulation to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope that his management will steer the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"That drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, especially given how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high demonstrate.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first to make a friendship work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when isolation really dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross's yearning for Rachel - all came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to them, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As one care worker explained to me: "My role as an audience listener for people who are depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interaction with friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I'll get on with it" has a huge effect, like the feeling that talking openly about problems is perceived as weakness. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're going to Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with a whole new set designed to celebrate the day, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria hits the post to help PSG crush Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut on Tuesday to help PSG move past Malmo.
Here are the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held their own as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at the Principality Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as PSG set the French champions on their way, but they then missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not only to qualify for the knockout rounds but improve on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a classic game from Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was substituted later in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so it's a good start to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
'That's a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry we didn't score another goal or two. '
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes to the side that held a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but he was outplayed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmo defence before finishing beautifully into the far corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
But if anyone thought PSG would score a big win, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, fielded nine internationals and was a tough opponent with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic that went wide of Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves away at times, with some misplaced passes and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who floundered in no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then sent off after Cavani brought him on after the restart.
Still, he showed much more skill when bringing his team-mates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shot that was deflected past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, with the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fished down a left flank from Maxwell.
That ended any notion that Malmo could get back into the game, and only a superb intervention from Wiland from close range to stop David Luiz could keep the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his team and the Norwegian said: 'Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games aren't enough. '
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered Glencore said in a statement that it has sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown depresses demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to repay about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125p a share, a 2.4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price.
It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40%.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
At noon on Tuesday, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official to Washington, will take place on September 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US president and first lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to broaden U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also allowing President Obama and President Xi to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before heading to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing assertiveness in disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car borrowed and driven to scrap metal
A 29-year-old wanted to make a dream come true and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rain-soaked motorway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the county of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, skidded on a wet track and crashed into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage and no one was injured.
Damage to property is estimated at 40,000 euros.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to Bayern Munich in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for Al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
Bayern were apparently on the verge of signing Spain superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - Xavi's list of titles is breathtaking.
The 35-year-old left FC Barcelona in the summer after 24 years and moved to Al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi reveals that he was on the brink of leaving Barcelona before Euro 2008.
'I was told Barça wanted to sell me, 'he said.
"Madrid won everything then, we won nothing," he says.
And that's what Bayern did.
Xavi: 'There was an offer from Bavarian'
Rummenigge wanted me.
Remember: Jürgen Klinsmann took over Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this is now working for the German record holder: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: 'Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship.'
'Pep told me I wasn't going to change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me. '
'He's got me with that. '
Who knows how Bayern's 2008-09 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi was on the pitch for Barca in the quarter-final of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance, knocked out the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and at the end celebrated the king class triumph.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film making
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight on Sunday night, the veteran actor interrupted Brown as she stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
'When we talk about diversity, you're talking about the cast of the film, not the cast of the show, 'Damon said.
Brown reacted with shocked, offended disbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the Martian actor's comments solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think - whoever the director is - about how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing: 'Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her - that's SO KNOW it hurts.'
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made a national impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated album of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
'American Ninja Warrior 'crowned first champion
Professional climber and handler Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which was just finishing its seventh season, had never seen a contestant complete all levels of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task in time, becoming the first athlete to complete the grueling Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought win, still in shock at winning the $1 million grand prize.
'I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never made more than $10,000 or had a life, 'Isaac told E! about his pile of money.
So all of a sudden.. like I can't even imagine what that's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first to complete the course, doesn't get any prize money.
Under the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it," Weed said.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life-changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he holds any grudges about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He received masses of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I get hit by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, with filming set to begin in early 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to advance within one game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so elusive for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched six innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
'I want to finish this year strong, 'Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game focused.
Designated Tigers hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double down the left-field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run lead from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
Verhagen put third baseman Trevor Plouffe on a double play with a pair of runners and the final run in the second.
It was the major league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer hit an RBI double off Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
The right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an inactive Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who was off the injured list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back ailment.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got going and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hicks gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to J.D. Martinez brought in Victor Martinez, who hit a single up the middle on the game's first run.
Victor Martinez completed his 0-21 winning streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers rallied in the second, scoring on a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes was on a pitch count, scoring no runs in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes allowed three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired because of a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a sprain in his right hip.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected between 450 and 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls in the state capital of Hesse had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the Giessen regional council responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action with German participation in Syria is a possibility.
"I believe that decisive consideration of military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of "collective turning a blind eye."
Four years ago, they were glad that the chalice of military participation had passed Germany by.
"Now the conflict is landing on our doorstep," he told Deutschlandfunk radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this regard.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, along with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU interior ministers intend to make a new attempt at binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government wants to provide greater support to the Länder in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the federal states, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who needed protection would also get it.
But those who have no prospects of staying cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was impressively shared in the round.
The Chancellor said the state as a whole now had to put in a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers from seeking escape routes via Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were initial arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness accounts.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
A global ocean is sloshing beneath the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Researchers have concluded this from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
Accordingly, the moon is reeling slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This lurch movement is only small, but nevertheless too large for a continuously solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It has been known for some time that there must be liquid water beneath Enceladus's ice sheet.
Back in 2006, Cassini discovered ice volcanoes at Saturn's south pole, spewing water vapor and ice particles that feed Saturn's so-called E ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
1860 Munich will have to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier in the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of compulsory rest."
'It's hard for us, it's a big loss. '
"Of course we have to think now," sporting director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper, referring to the possible signing of a non-club professional.
The Sixers, however, first presented a defensive lineman as a training guest.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has' the opportunity to prove his ability '.
Goalscorer Rubin Okotie may return to team training next week after suffering concussion.
The Austrian international is due to join up with training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in a violent collision during the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0-3).
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
Those who want to pay attention to their slim line, however, are often rather discouraged from them.
This is because mangoes contain relatively high amounts of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit thus supports eyesight, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin colour alone does not tell us how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS, the US parcel service, is again hiring up to 95,000 temporary staff for the Christmas period in the US.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
Drivers, in particular, are being sought.
Last year, UPS added 95,000 temporary workers to its workforce for the holiday season.
With online business booming, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements since last year to prepare for the holiday shopping season.
In 2013, late deliveries brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First foehn storm, then distinctive cold front
In the coming night, the Föhn will break through in the valleys on the northern side of the Alps, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and during the night to Thursday the foehn blows partly with storm force through the foehn valleys.
After the end of the foehn on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us bringing heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwesterly current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the foehn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
As a consequence, the foehn blows until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km / h, occasionally and especially in the Uri region also with more than 100 km / h.
The Föhn can penetrate in places as far as the adjacent plateau, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km / h are possible.
While stormy foehn weather in the north on Wednesday will bring summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity is starting to build up on the southern slope of the Alps.
This is where rain sets in, lasting until Thursday evening.
In total, more than 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the foehn will run out of air, followed by a cold front with heavy, partly thundery rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind is picking up strongly to stormy, and temperatures are dropping significantly.
The following days will be autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of the mayor of the city, Ignazio Marino, a hitherto unnamed place in the park on Oppio Hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
In "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now being honoured as a "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome, next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protestants in the city of the popes were often only able to live their faith in secrecy as a minority.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
At the time, he saw the city as a depraved babel of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the sale of indulgences.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now been published with splendid pictures.
In the beginning there was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has retained his "language" with colourful colours and imaginative forms - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project for about three years, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books."
The result are cycles devoted to themes such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments and the Lord's Prayer.
Thus, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old's painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation from Martin Luther and one sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry binding has golden letters.
The 75-year-old thus allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions, twice over.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the catalyst for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"That's when the education happened with the cane," Otmar Alt remembers.
"I have tried to come to terms with this so that I may be able to get along with the Father again."
His second concern, he says, is to restore art to a higher status in a fast-moving time: "The perception of pictorial worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is supplanted.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
'I'm a dinosaur in that respect. '
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into" the pictures, to let them affect him, to discover and to feel the power they have: "The picture looks for its counterpart."
At the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation on Tuesday, Klaus Altepost confessed that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Alt had not taken care to comprehend the Bible completely, but had chosen the themes that were important to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." The result is a bible of images.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction begins on BMX track
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, mounds of earth modelled for a circuit: one year later, almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX track, this was over again.
Negligence in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So they deported him, searched for a new place - now with formal planning permission and application for planning permission.
The approval will be received in October, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, the first municipal councillor, has now been able to inform the children's and youth committee.
"I hope there will be more visible things happening this year," she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool would then begin without "any further pause in memory."
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending out a clear signal this weekend.
Football reacts to the worsening situation in Germany and assures politicians of its help in overcoming the pending problems.
'I think it's the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification. '
'Basically, no one can say it's none of my business, it's nothing to do with me. '
"It must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At his annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday, where I will meet Minister of State Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The issue will certainly play a central role here," he said.
Football could and should help.
The decisive course, however, must be set by politicians.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 für ein Willkommen" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said in the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some Bundesliga clubs also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - # helpeswelcome" on the left sleeve of the jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's head of sport Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as a "matter of course."
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one can look the other way."
"We Bundesliga can, no, we have to use our charisma, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
For the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
Niersbach described supporting refugees as "a great collaborative effort of German football."
It is great that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their localities.
Just as great is the fact that small and small clubs are involved.
The '1-0 for a win' message we've been sending out is lived out in football.
"This is hugely significant," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, is making available 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The chief executive of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the US, he fell on a glass of water that he was carrying in his left hand after midnight, the Wirtschaftswoche reported on Wednesday.
"He nearly bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week," "WiWo" quotes SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
He said the 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and was "fully operational."
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to run the software company.
"I am fully there for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner the whole time," McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
For him it is important to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Anything like this can happen to anyone."
'It's important to get up when you've fallen. '
McLaren reserve driver Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen tweeted a photo of the incident and said he suffered the injury when he fell off his bike.
He is therefore no more an option as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the Singapore night race this weekend than he was a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes of a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The Germany international will also miss the Bundesliga leaders' duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 pm / Sky).
'We can't rely on him, unfortunately, 'Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
The BVB coach left open whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga's top match against Leverkusen on Sunday: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
Tuchel will not only change his starting line-up based on Reus' position, given the heavy workload he has put on his players.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeping position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Tuchel left open, however, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future.
In all likelihood, he will also play the second match.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers the assertive statement of team-mate Reus that the goal must be to reach the final for BVB in the Europa League understandable: "Marco is not so wrong with that."
'I think we've got a good chance of winning the title. '
Robot cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper drawn up by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, envisages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the International Motor Show (IAA) of a "new age of mobility."
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also intends to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
Among other things, the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on the 9 motorway in Bavaria to test new technology.
To ensure that "no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver," the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt them to new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, and the driver becomes more and more of a passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nonetheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not expected until well after 2020," he said.
The authors of the study estimate that the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will amount to around 8.4 billion euros in 2025.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans are still sceptical about self-driving cars - much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent do not expect it to happen until 20 years from now, and 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the United States.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to cede control on all roads during the entire journey.
On the motorway, 15 per cent could imagine this in flowing traffic, and 45 per cent in traffic jams.
Just over one in four would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and doubles start at European Table Tennis Championships
The Dusseldorf-based player currently only wants to play singles at the title matches from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is due on 22 September at the latest.
'It's a huge loss for our team. '
'The boys found out in the morning, 'he said.
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was on the flight to China for a long-term sponsor appointment.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," explained European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
Hamelin, who heads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing then and we became European champions."
"That is what we should be focusing on," said the world number five.
Manchester United's England international Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
During the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle from Héctor Moreno and substituted after a long period of treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old teammate.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figurine horror cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts.
'I can't say I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture anymore because I have white hair. '
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk," on view from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about himself.
Actually, he was against it, because "to me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the Kunsthalle's director, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the hard-to-overview work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed any training.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellently choreographed synthesis of the arts, for which a great deal of effort was put into it: for example, a stylist was hired to style the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers transported 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special treat: a Lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It represents the designer's first tentative attempts at fashion.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football), Gaultier said, he put bras and clothes on his teddy bear.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, Gaultier said in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
He couldn't pay the models for his first fashion show of his own.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
In the old days, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were made in large quantities for customers, who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
That alone does not work today any more, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion point Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen lace, fashion played a larger role, was then supplanted by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives a few examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stylistic epochs, represents an increasing potential for commissions.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion lace Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener lace and embroideries together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 per cent of turnover has gone.
There are almost no more private specialized shops and also the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way any more.
Nowadays, mass-produced goods are much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively through chains.
Exports, currently to Russia and the US, are also weakening.
Enough reasons, then, for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying a seal of quality that shows that we produce in an ecologically and socially compatible way."
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Degree designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, one has to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension arises between the freshest ideas of the designers and the enterprises, which must think above all economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
She embosses the pattern in silver using an elaborate process.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who would like a souvenir.
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador for the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends aren't supposed to be touched, but Disney is nevertheless venturing into a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," however, this is not a new film adaptation, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
It's unclear who will play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews.
But the director has already been chosen: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods."
Xi Urges Wider Opening of Economy to the World
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting start-ups and pushing ahead with reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to raise private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by means of test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
It will also make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or green card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their work and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby requiring consumers to consume significantly higher doses of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has received a working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for nerve toxins for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
Large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury, however, that around 50 percent of catches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would then be unsellable.
In exchange for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller peacefish, such as carp, are usually so low polluted that they are already meeting the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary manoeuvre that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates strongly in predatory fish in particular through the food chain.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children."
However, with regard to the current maximum values, the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is released into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written statement from the Federal Environment Ministry to Greens member of the Bundestag Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish in areas such as the Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded," Der Spiegel had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health hazards in the EU's RASFF alert system.
