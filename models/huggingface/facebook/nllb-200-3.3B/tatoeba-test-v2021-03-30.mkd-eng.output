It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this might happen.
That's going to take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm going to walk.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't helping me enough.
I'm not going to use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a dismissal.
How much is it worth?
We had water up to our necks.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom has already left.
He probably still has it.
It looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from seven to nine.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We just sat there and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan has shared his racist views publicly.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves have taken the flock.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun?
I love that tattoo.
I got a free card.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're a fool, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel alone in this city.
What have they been doing?
Tom is childless.
I'm not living in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
Can we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is fierce.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom knows he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make up for it.
Tom doesn't know how to fake it.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love the honey.
I have to confess something.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom is a little grumpy in the face.
Nobody gives a shit.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered yes.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when the time is right.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit the cat.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
We didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my buddy. He thinks he's too big a brother for me.
I will, if it's all the same to you.
Tom is right.
You're being rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop denigrating Tom.
What could possibly go wrong?
When will I arrive in Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He wants ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously a moron.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat. I know.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you give your best?
Mary is rewinding the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I should probably go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't whine.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London. I'm not going anywhere.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really eating pizza so early in the morning?
Can you back it up?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You are lucky.
My nose runs every time I catch a cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's alignment is off.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Did anyone else go into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was horrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had a price tag.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
It's got to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd be here.
Just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
Don't be a man with a mould.
She tried it herself.
Get out of here!
Is there a delivery charge?
I want turnips.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy these for me?
You've never seen one of these before, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be all right.
Mosquitoes are carriers of malaria.
You've been putting this off too long, you have to finish it tonight.
I don't know.
That is unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What's with you and him?
Whatever you're doing, you better hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept checks.
A newspaper costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verb forms: the pronounced, conditional, commanded and the transposed.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom is smiling.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are on point.
I don't have a gun.
I need a warrant.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I first met the Queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom is now a martyr.
Tom looked angry.
What will Japan's economy be like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How are you awake?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our court is large.
It's a child's play.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back by 6:30.
Tom took me to his pussy.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a scene out of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a tramp.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
The girl saw it too.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom seems to be quite sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things that Tom complained about was the food.
Be careful not to get stuck in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash dishes.
We weren't expecting them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want to play tennis?
It's going to be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they'll try to escape.
They all went crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer still stands.
I'm here to look for her.
Scrooz is wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe that Tom is gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom might be playing chess with Mary right now.
You seem to be right.
Don't talk about her.
How weird!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom has his room cleaned.
There are no survivors.
She should have shut up.
I'm not like you!
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. Then why are you still alive?
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I stuck a claw in his arm.
Tom isn't alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Morality is important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king had a particularly difficult time holding speeches because of his severe speech impediment.
She declined the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is a liability.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset. I'm not upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape afterwards.
It licked.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by man-eaters.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Can't you hear me scream?
I'm going for a walk.
Don't overeat. It's not that bad.
Just ask them to give it back.
Pull the pin.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
So you didn't want the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're pleased.
They're not sincere.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at that star that's shining.
I don't know how to help him.
Put your seat belt on.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is wrong.
We are bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least give me a little help?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to confront Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm such a retard.
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
A hot water heater is heating the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have money.
Dan came to visit yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This job requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm tired of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from their hives.
Let's forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're a quick to learn.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hi, ladies. How are you?
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
His sleeve is stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
- Shut up!
I couldn't fight it.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everybody's gone but him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom. I'm not your father.
Do not die.
They were banging on his side.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he was asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby likes to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was having fun.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've examined the situation thoroughly.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water was up to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you'll have to let Tom go.
Shame on you!
Don't get too excited.
Sylvia really enjoyed the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Are you interrupting?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are burning.
Tom convinced Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him down!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-step process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's your call, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran across the aisle.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The Senf is really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was a millie.
Tom was a good man.
Tom sat next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get the job.
That was almost 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there someone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to go.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've locked it down.
Tom is struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom seriously needs help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfying?
Tom held out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that his previous dentist told him that he could remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your views.
Tom was the one who suggested that.
It just seems wrong.
Tom is a smart guy.
Curry powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom was driving through town with his brake pad on the side without noticing.
Yes, in any case.
You want to go camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's going to be there?
We didn't want to cut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for much longer?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You have it now, don't you?
I'm pretty blown away.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning in his grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, failing to see that their own conduct is unfair.
Wear high heels to make yourself taller.
You want to go bowling?
Sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right about that.
I've been robbed three times in a month.
Can I come?
You need a break?
I like to exercise.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a sound.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me a douche.
What's that got to do with anything?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up on the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're a different person.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made his decision.
Tom won't be very productive.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here. I'm not sure we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate language.
Your coffee is getting you high!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is a good writer.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to screw it up.
Tom is really irritated.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all find her behavior repugnant.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose line is this?
Avoid her
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to pitch a tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom might have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You'll have to ask him that.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to walk, we're ready to walk.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
I want to travel. Me too.
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I'm the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom may be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your type.
I'm sorry about that.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
The butterflies, the butterflies, and the cockroaches are all insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where did the piñaceos come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I see the menu?
He is smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't succeed.
The dogs are white.
Pull it out of there.
I don't drink soda. I'm not a big drinker.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the type.
Help me with this, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a porridge with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to do whatever he wants.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking pot.
I know how that sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry, you know.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom suddenly stopped.
My father used to bring me here when I was young.
You are such a fool.
Put the bottle down.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm being hardened.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
Always bragging about his English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has fallen.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom is packing his bags.
What good does that do?
That's very useful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I've decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Look what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
You seem to be unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't look at them.
Tom didn't eat lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be such a flash.
I can't open this jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear you.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the whole idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I'm perfectly fine with waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
It's not a high priority.
Take this one.
What's it now?
You know?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was prepared for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never surrender.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
You want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was at home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
You think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom isn't very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
You take care!
Linda had a seizure and suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 at the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a whore.
I feel kind of hurt.
I'll do it the best I can.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom corrected himself.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not roosters.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a loose gown.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's have a bite.
Beekeepers remove the dung to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I will never forget it.
Tom won the argument.
You should have brought them here.
Tom lives abroad.
They work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relieved of that.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He sat by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless with it.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom likes to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got some serious issues.
This is not blue. This is purple.
Who was she with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs are usually killed before they are a year old, and then they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money on water.

I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on, now.
The book is heavy.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms at the hotel are obviously very poor at suppressing sounds.
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We're going to be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.

Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood before her, looking at her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen wipes.
I'm safe. I know.

Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you just need to listen to it.
Do you know how to grin?

There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I love how the French spell their word for "boobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobobob.

I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.

Take a whiff, your nose is running.

Who needs a rhetorical question?
Mary was proud of her tongue.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.

That's not a good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.

I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.

They concluded that the ship had sunk.
Did you buy the medicine?
Has Tom been drinking?

The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, all right?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's getting on my nerves.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong about everything.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not shy.
Tom is under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?

Now the question is what do we do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
Finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Keep your voice down.
Do you trust Tom now?

That sounds pretty good.
Tom really likes Boston.

Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom is ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so anxious tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We are exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make up for it.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are great, and they get even better after he drinks a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know anything about business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say that he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be all right... when the willow bears grapes.
Tom is a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
How long has the fire been burning?
Tom may be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't give anything away.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.

Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?

Keep your promises.
I looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
With every division, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you tired of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.

Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.

How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.

Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Hold my fortune!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not going anywhere.
Hold on a second.
I've got things to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's just enough air in here.
She married a nobody.
The wind has stopped.
Nothing has changed.
You shouldn't wear anything too revealing.
The old man's dying.
I don't like books.
I had a lucky shot.
Why would Tom want that?
The sun is one star among billions of others.
The active fluids.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I have to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty common.
Did you Google her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's the explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's what I'm dealing with.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
He who can hear the butterflies laugh knows what the clouds taste like.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not for you to eat like a commodity!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
You forgot that again?

I just finished my shift.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The creek's on our right.
Tom isn't an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?

I think it's time for you to go.
The guy's a thug.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom is a bit of a jerk.

Will I be replaced?
I need to find us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.

Whales are a species of mammal.
Dan seduced Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
Did you like his music? No, did you?
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to turn around.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm here on holiday.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral procession.
We're probably lying to ourselves.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, just let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Shake your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles is it from here to Boston?
I'm perfect for that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Each people has its own language.
I would never have accepted it.
It's getting colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were frozen.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Tom may be drunk.
Sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me where this is on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead to the future.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom chasing you?
This is my newest review.
I haven't felt well for two days.
The intestines are waste.
We don't think so.
I think Tom is rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a brain and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
A walk in the rain is out of the question.
I'll tell them to go right now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got the Assalin.
There was no one left in the town.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can go all day like this.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing a fucking egg at Mary.
We're all safe now.
Okay, I get the point.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
Nothing that happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Do not despair.
I want to see pornos with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Please be quiet.
Tom immediately became concerned.
I have no feelings for her.
I expected a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy could not swim across the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're too good.
The old maid has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely got out.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise in Hawaii all year long.
Tom was motivated.
You may have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and slap her - that counts as sexual assault.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's have a vote.
Tom is sedated.
You can't just do whatever you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Should I go on?
He was blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man, you know.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and wrong than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the traffic lights to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull is divided into several watertight sections.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's not talk about it.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your edge.
There are false alarms.
I'm not waiting forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I'm not waiting for them.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Are you mad at me?
He's not the shy boy he used to be.
Count?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys everywhere in groups, some playing checkers, some playing tennis, some playing ball, some riding a bicycle or riding a wooden horse.
Doubts are what destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was covered in snow.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain that love causes is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You need to go home.
Come this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're going to find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've scratched your head.
We're going to the bathroom.
Take back the headquarters.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom buy Mary off?
I don't know how that got in there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yes, I was.
It's less humid than yesterday.
I'm having a hard time making new friends.
It's funny how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have any family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us are going to do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false trail.
Tom was fighting.
I said he might come back.
You need to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone is singing.
You know how to fix things?
You go.
I forgot his address.
Are you a handyman?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her lower back has a slit on one side.
Let's get something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing all right.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom is no longer breathing.
It's all over now.
Nobody came with me.

Why are you fighting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first one to ask the question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we'll need next year.
I'll light a match in the darkroom.
How much is that one?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
You get up at six?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was suffering from pneumonia, I just languished in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard me right.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, my God.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You gave it your all.
He is greedy.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs fixing.
I'm really impressed with you, Tom.
Tom is a jerk.
Tom is not listening.
They want everything you said you'd give them right away.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom was behind.
I'll never let you down.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you should call them.
No, some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
We were 18 years old at the time.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get so upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran off.
Keep it up.
This is disgusting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
You got caught.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
They're being decent.
You are magnificent.

Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
They're not burning.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't do the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I've been through a lot worse.
Tom tries to stay calm.
I used that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one drink.
No one writes to me.
Tom is heartbroken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You are a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
They're all under control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they found me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you a friendly tip?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who is Dan talking to?
We were cursed.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look anything like his dad.

Who would do that?
I'm going to tell you a secret that's going to change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to be a pain.

I'm going to stop.

I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the ridge.
I'll take whatever it takes.
It's not gonna be all right.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's going to be Christmas soon.
You should be flattered.
Unfortunately, that is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to this kind of trouble.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the coffee machine.
He rarely went there.
Tom is shy.
Let's sing and dance.

Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating the verses is quite difficult, if it is even possible.

Do you have a key, by any chance?
Let's be realistic here.
Tea with lemon, please.

Maybe this will help.

What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
He's dropped the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
It might seem strange.
No one can escape death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.

When are you going?
I'd like to buy a couch.
I didn't get a response from her.

Let's do that.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.

I already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I am a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom got very angry.
What situations would you use it in?
Can't we start from the beginning?

Please, air the room.

Sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for having us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was dismissed.
I'm not sleepy anymore.

Come on, everybody, follow me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't exactly old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It'll be worth it.

How's your new job?
I hope you like what I got you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
They're a little bad for me.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's really good.
Let's get down to it.
You're allowed to sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me nervous.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you get something to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.

This is green.
Tom regretted telling Mary.
Go and find him.
It's in the basement.

I see what you mean.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wasn't Canadian?
I will scream.
I just got off the phone with them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
Everybody is seated.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I'm not comfortable with walking.
She seems a little young to be getting married.
I hate school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it. It's not broken.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to begin.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What are your hobbies?
So I'm serious about this.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary doing that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give the signal?
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you note.
They won't be here tomorrow.
Please, find him.

- What?
What if Tom says no?

I'm not sure that's what it was.
You are the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.

It's really close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - it is acquired.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The tannin is very stretchy when washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding from him.
You heard of him?

Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip his morning swim because it was cold.
It's not necessary.

I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom is grown up.
Please repeat.
You're being very dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
They say that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family begins where yours ends.
He is my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
That's some serious shit.
We are like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work.
Could it be Tom?
I need to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the crime scene.
I asked the same thing.
I'm rather hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom is keeping the letter.
Tom would like that.
She runs out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's going to tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom shouldn't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more I get hungry.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a wuss.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They've sounded the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
You sure these aren't real diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What is the answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm concerned about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is erratic.
Keep your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I feel warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it that way.
Would you do me a favour?
This is between me and Tom.
I am the one who is irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.

Tom is quite weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom is getting paid a lot.
It was pathetic.
You obviously cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked everybody.
Self-driving cars are now commonplace.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there is a problem...
Tom is wearing chairs.
Whatever you do, you have to give it your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new coin.
I fooled Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organist was an older man.
I play tennis.
I need you to help me.
Did his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You are a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do like I showed you?
I'm making a fire.
I like the blue.
The girl let the bird go.

I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I felt like I owed it to myself to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
I was a little bit grumpy.

Tom is a pervert.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
There was a census in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me the night before, but you lied to me, obviously.
Take a guess.
He took off his clothes to bathe.
A river of sweat was pouring down my face.
Mary abandoned her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight this.

I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you move?
Movies are a great entertainment.
At first, I couldn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me want to play jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to bad weather.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.

Get your ass over here, Tom.
That wasn't exactly accurate.
I'll go see what I can find out.

Tom had become a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations
The airfield is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?

Tom isn't scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It wasn't that bad.
It's not coming off.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes her coffee hot, and Tom likes his coffee light.
I gave you a false address.
I crashed.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane will come.
I'm just a little shy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom was stunned.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The bridesmaids are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?

Where does Tom shop?
He looked awful.

How could anyone be so stupid?

It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Put your shoes on.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has a temper problem.
Get him down.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink, will you?
I think I might have a cold.
The question is whether or not he can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You have to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I need to buckle up.
Tom almost collided with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.

Please be on time.
The Germans have a more sympathetic attitude towards the Gaul.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom is not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister is sleeping.

I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.

I made Tom very angry.
A week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's give him some privacy.

I can't argue with that.
I'm not the patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I'm not getting any benefit from it.
It's not raining yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, give me a call.
Were you sincere?
The cup was empty.

They're close.

It resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're qualified for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we agreed?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I will never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's dead.

I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?

You were wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may go now, sir.
Maybe it was him.
You're ready to cry.

What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.

Would you like a menthol candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They will.
I'll have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get off here.

How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy person to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a seaweed.
This was a premeditated crime.

Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?

She likes to show off the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I've heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came.
You're not.
You think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Have I done something to make Tom angry?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light to read.
Tom is arguing with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the curtain.
Guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Wait a minute. What did he say?
When did you buy it from us?
Let's just keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll take the lead.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone is waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's light out.
Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall!
Tom looks shocked.
Tom got upset.
That's how it should be.
Let's try to get along.
That's going to be hard.
I'm not comfortable with retirement.
Thanks for the question.
I have a good reason to dislike Tom.
It gave me an idea.
Can I start eating now?
I'll get right on it.
These are her shoes.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should never have been sent.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?

It's not an emergency.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.

I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will come.

Tom drives to school.
Did you see?
I'm gonna have to think this through carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone is talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write poems?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home was a Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take the trap off.
I don't know what you think is gonna change.
I'm doing this for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You've only caused me pain.
What did Tom find out now?
We stayed up all night, trying to come up with a plan.
Tom is always angry.
Tom will sleep.
Let's keep the peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We were worried.

Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
You hate them that much?

We stood up to say hello to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be tested.

You are nothing.
We're not going to find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds perfectly valid.

You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.

Tom left work early.
We have everything.
I made these cookies for him.
When does the school year end?
You were right all along.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "man"?
How many instruments do you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.

Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects I should take.

Try not to worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe that Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Does Dan know what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you to come back here.

I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
People, get in here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.

That was exciting.
I can't see a thing.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They put up their tent on the beach.
I didn't mean that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.

- What?
Do you want some cheese?

They'll be well paid.

You are at once heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's say for the time being you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could tell.
Tom is a backless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed it.

I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget that one.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping track.

The longest place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very Futuristic.
You're supposed to help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
He wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the corner.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about that, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more deplorable than stupidity and indifference.
They're all pissed off.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What are Web sites made of?

What's in your hand?
She's a young college girl.

You want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
They pay me to help you.
The jacket is too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I'm fine with it.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you as happy as you want me to be.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.

You're very direct.
Tom pulled the bottle cap out.
Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the mantel.
The dove is a symbol of peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
The traitor!
I'm doing it for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I feel sleepy.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a relationship between personality and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Does anyone disagree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom is a freezer.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing computer games.
You might be right.
What are you holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom can really fight.
What is it that really bothers her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom wrecked his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All the lizards lay eggs.
We'll take care of it.
I think Tom is cruel.
He didn't answer my letter.
We settled down.
You seem disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things stand.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, just come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a hole.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions don't know the difference between colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is obvious.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look at this.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I got sweat coming out of my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We are in real danger.

These guys don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever has.
We packed their suitcases.
What kept you up last night?
They cast a curse on us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
Just turn it on.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
Turtles are long-lived.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom is very sleepy.
Are you helping him?
She looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember that.
Did you drive here?
I don't know the rest of the story.
We're all finished.
I'm sure of it.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who makes that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs to undergarments.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for fools.
Why would I help him?
Tom shined his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom is shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Look at me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
You got it, Tom.
You've been very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They'll be sorry they did.
I'm a fag.
I'll see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
May I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to swim.
I should have a look.
It's time for dinner.
I'm in a hurry.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's slipping for the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in here.
Is there someone sitting here?
I have to cut back on my monthly expenses.
No one is talking about us.
I think you're overstating the issue.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What use are you to me?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I love it when she wears that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They live on the floor below this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain, but he won't budge.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is laughing at you.
I think I'm going to eat out.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
Tom asked us to babysit him.
I underlined the word "Alice" to emphasize it.
Third chance.
We should go.
This air pasta is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
To strive for virtue and to renounce vice.
You are a genius.
I'm against the project.
Weren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm the one!
I was too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite harmless.
There are reports to be written.
It hurts here.
You're worrying Tom.
Where are we going?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You missed a button.
Diseases often strike at the most inopportune of times.
The dog stared at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they weren't really human at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all gone, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom mean?
That was really nice.
Everybody dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We like beauty.
I think about it all day long.
I suggest we focus on getting out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous structure.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying above the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is that English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got ears like a cork.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't quite know how to answer the question.
This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not being unreasonable.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom backed off.
Don't say that again.
The cherries are red.
Maybe we can find something.
You look good.
You made Tom unhappy.
Heat it up.
Tom looked like he was displeased.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become stronger both physically and mentally.
She's a happy girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to walk.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't let that slip your mind.
I got a 9 on my chemistry test.
They were lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was presentable.
How was the dance?
I'm a student here.
I'm tired of it.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm going to take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike on the dirt.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Come to lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The headline should catch the reader's attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I would rather die than submit.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't need to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I was watching a French movie with English subtitles.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illness is false.
Dan had a turbulent relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us now.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital there isn't very big.
Most people have to work to make ends meet.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We will stay.
I'm not petting their dog.
I haven't been sleeping properly.
I don't want to and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls reach puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's moving.
Tell Tom he must not forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon be clear.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I'm still not at liberty to tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was doped.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I have a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants revolted against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself home.
Tom taught me to sing.
What book are you reading? A novel.
Your car is on fire.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half the species are female.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me like that.
I want to do community service to make up for all the things I've done.
Tom tied his shoes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I'm not complaining.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I had to take into account in the translation.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the wasps poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're wrong, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a college party.
Mary has been very supportive.
Tom is in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's paying the rent?
I was a little careless.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I waited for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care about that.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the tune.
You've seen what I can do.
We got a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
Can I have a menu?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom nodded his head.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He has poor eyesight.
It's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
Hawks have a sharp look.
I wrote it for them.
Last year I lived in Boston.
Tom was honking.
We need new carpet.
We share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom politely smiled.
That teacup is pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off his wig.
They went for a walk.
This is his maternal grandfather.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magic.
The volcano has been reactivated.
Tom told me he had some things to take care of.
How does that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The small island from a distance looks like a turtle.
Do the shrimp bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop your whining.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait up.
You have no idea how long.
The dog was barking.
Let's go to the movies.
Good women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He screwed up.
Mary felt her face warm up.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom is a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
Don't get in my way.
Tell me what happened again.
Tom is making a fool of himself.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She works from nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the words?
It hurts so much here.
I hate the carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm going to get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's not natural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom is expendable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure that we could trust Tom.
Everybody's mad at him.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom was my companion.
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn't help him.
You're wasting your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The blush is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
I'll wash the dishes. Okay, I'll wipe them.
I would buy it.
He's the one who's been crawling around.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom is wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was going to be here?
The earthquake started the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I would have loved to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop your weapon on the ground.
- And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's entirely possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's working like a charm.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You got it?
My day was filled with activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father is sick with the flu.
I'm not waiting too long.
Look at you.
This is great.
Missing empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should see a dentist.
The soldiers were shooting.
Tom doesn't put up with it.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom went outside.
This is all I can do.
He sticks to his principles.
Tom is angry.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
He broke it.
Tom is a big tit.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think that went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked around about them.
I'm a little sleepy.
I'm planning to go to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
They're roaring like a yagu.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the bin.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
- Will you reconsider? - Yes.
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom sat at a desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk too fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you what little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
It's an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm just being a dick.
I like the way you dance.
I need some.
They've outsmarted us.
Tom is right over there.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now point it.
It's a squirrel.
Sit down, please.
Iron is harder than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
My condor is itching.
Tom didn't say anything about that.
It's probably right.
We had to walk home in the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I cried.
You picked me.
The answer is affirmative.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go and wake up Tom.
How do I find him?
The ice has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
That must be a relief.
I never got caught.
I love my homeland.
I never learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't lecture me on this.
Tom is comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't make it up to her.
Tom was stealing from me.
The victory is bitter.
They look in the mirror.
It's not like me to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom walked Mary to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two are against me!
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
Tom tried everything.
You got a cigarette?
The kids are upstairs.
I'm a music major.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
Pretty proud of that.
Don't count on it.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'm going to send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Suppose Mary caught Tom a fish.
It's nice to be home.
It's not that bad.
They're going off.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new bed for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand that.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is this all about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary got us started on the first day.
Let's not talk.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
"Won't you eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later".
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off his shirt.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom started singing.
Tom isn't that tall.
She wears a leather belt around her waist.
They put out the fire.
They finally left.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'm going to go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't like to use a dildo - I prefer real cocks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom made a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
He doesn't fight.
I'm expecting you to help me.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only got A's in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The fence is temporarily sealed.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom is allergic to pollen.
They've contacted local politicians.
Tom is taking notes.
They gave me this map.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
Everybody has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom is strange.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a 10-dollar-a-week pocket watch.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe. I'm not going to let you down.
How long did you work for them?
I should help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom is shushing me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it down with a sponge, right?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over to our house to help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cooling down.
I couldn't sleep all night.
You have to trust me.
I'm looking for you.
You want a robot?
They're losing their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go wherever I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is a self-taught man.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The sleeve has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I suspected as much.
Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to be doing.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What's for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the supermarket.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'll leave first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a nun just days before her 99th birthday.
Did you look everywhere?
It's important to remember that no one is ever 100% nothing.
He gestures when he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, but because of his age and frail health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom pruned the tree.
The ground is still wet, so the sword will probably give way.
I was dozing off.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog followed me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom has gone.
She's aiming to become an actress.
I broke my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this done.
We are too sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's foolish.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can get a message to her.
She's a little flushed.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood and said nothing.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow, we'll be in Boston.
Is this where you live?
This room looks like a bone.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom is a bit of a coward.
We don't have to go.
I'm speaking with Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to leave and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are soft.
That's not important.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle sat in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
Bags falling from the tree.
You got a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way to get to the post office from here?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen to me, you need to know this.
Are you going to wear a mask this year?
I'll do as you wish.
It's not that hot for me either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door is slammed.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did he react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I miss him.
He's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary looking at him.
You're making me feel bad.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is a blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk about this.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky is light.
The noise will wake the baby.
Just keep your eyes straight.
That's not exactly something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing dice.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call the security team.
Tom thinks you'd prefer blue.
How did you get here?
She's picking up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary to her.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We'll talk for two hours.
He's the one who told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
The long walk has whetted his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom had a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to.
They both laughed again.
I need this wedding to be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just silly.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest male in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only comfort.
No one would have cared.
Have you been writing in your journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand that.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't go into that now.
Why are you bending over?
Come on, Tom. You got to be kidding me.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're more or less ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bought it.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the stick out.
I helped him uncork the table.
I had a schnitzel and fries last night.
It's better for your health to walk on stairs.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is a bitch.
I'm sorry I said anything to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom is a bigot.
I was sleeping in the bathroom.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That might work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese horror movies?
Did you catch them?
French was a slang language.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go and find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked the cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have had a lot of fun if we'd gone to the party.
Don't save the bell.
He kicked me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems confused.
You're having fun, you're young.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
What do you mean, you don't know?
That was a surprise.
You really think you're gonna make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells bad.
So I should know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm not guessing.
She runs slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just rented Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my comrades.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son is very fond of rockets.
You should hurry up.
Everybody is talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a trash.
We despise her.
He got here before them.
Here, brother, in half.
Tom sent the new mouse he had just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is a bit of a jerk.
The scenery is exquisite.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We should test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're going to have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'll try to keep it together.
Autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a famous hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for it to boil on the water.
I could get fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You are drunk!
It was quite majestic.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer that question.
I want to sign up for a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of common humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
This soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom continued to practice.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom stared into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It looks familiar.
I envy you.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, clover, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We are lazy.
You're a shrewd man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
The unknown always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door is open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I can keep a secret.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered though.
I'm working out.
She may have fooled you, but she's not fooled me!
Let's just get some fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I got hurt.
Tom reached into his bags and pulled out some money.
The room was a mess.
It's easy to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that was lodged in his spine.
It's a lot of fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If I may, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We are fine.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to be stung by a catfish.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
I need paper, pencil, ink and so forth.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did.
Tom is gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers are no good against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem like a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother arrives tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
They made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm going to ask him.
You're lucky I didn't touch you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make a face.
I was waiting outside.
You are impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton.
May I have your name and telephone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everybody knows about it.
Thank you for helping us.
What's Tom so mad about?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood under the railing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I'm not sure I understand.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I should break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket you have there.
I like your coffee.
They're all crooks.
I still think about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary missed school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in his desk.
Give him a chance.
I'm the one who's paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
You got enough?
The deaf are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom is a wuss.
I start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm pissed off at Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep at the wheel and caused an accident.
We were being held down.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was just beautiful.
Tom waves his hand to Mary.
It's all right.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It snowed last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't get carried away.
Tom is a book reviewer.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so wonderful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get down from this mountain.
I'm just starving to death.
I was disqualified.
- Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you the book.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds pretty cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch your step, Tom.
Tom tied his own shoelaces.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not wise.
Women in America were not allowed to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom isn't listening to us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock is ringing.
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm going to stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an undeniable fact.
Is it good?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't really talk much.
You're a good man.
Tom got a little grumpy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Madeline.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
Overweight people are a kind of mammal.
I'll get started on that.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I know Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the screw going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
When a grown child lies, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You're going to be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his arms.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the shutter.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do it all for you.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was serious.
I want a life.
Tom isn't in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write well.
This area is in a valley.
You really want to stay till Monday?
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
It's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, clear the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary in the bathroom.
I've been eating my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love the sunsets.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend away.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is impressed.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the counter.
I love your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that noise?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Shut it down.
Tom drowned.
They think we're a gang.
I just watch TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the carpet down.
That's exactly what happened.
I have a theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm with the one I want to be with.
Invite me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
How are you? Good, thank you!
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom. What are you doing?
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quickie.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes, and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We did nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might get along.
Why did you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just so confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has many good qualities.
Go with the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom isn't good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he had to make amends.
It's a message for them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom lifted the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not your pal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a rock.
Tom stared at her.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
So you wrote the book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be too forward.
He looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must plough it.
Tom isn't feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't bear to be killed.
No one is listening to you.
Well, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that that had happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make this uncomfortable for you.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted that he spilled red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
You heard about us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little further up.
I think about him every day.
I'll help look for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul desires.
Just take my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I have to do a day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is bullshit.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a rat.
You have very sharp eyes.
Isn't that the implication?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom into town.
We should let Tom go back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke and come inside.
Don't let them go.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more trustworthy.
Do you want to drink some water?
Tom is not friendly.
However, the amount is not exact.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four corners.
I kept working.
He developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and were silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one of them.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to pick up something at the supermarket?
Finish the dishes.
Tom wiped the blade of his knife from his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your nails bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the counter.
The devil is a sparrow.
I didn't say I spoke French.
You gave me a seductive look.
Don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat it from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should just come in later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you remember?
Give him a dollar.
- Was there an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
She looked at me sharply through her glasses.
Linda told Dan that he had dumped her.
Why would they be bothered by that?
Let's not bother Tom.
The nut is sturdy.
I just need a rest.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Is that who you bought these for?
I want you to behave.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It just came to me.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at various times in his life.
Want me to grab your cut?
I would trust them with my life.
I'm kind of hungry, you know?
I'll give it a shot.
What's there to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is going wild.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a shovel.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it out.
I'm not speaking fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom is not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town outside Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did he mention the test results?
If you want quality, you pay.
Tom was eating something.
She studies English.
With such a rich dream, he'll either become a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They start beating her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We came to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on his chewing gum.
Let it be my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended it?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to pick up bad habits!
She's started acting weird.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she had developed an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
With you, we're strong.
The president seemed strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad, you know?
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do as he wanted.
I thought you were a better chess player than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I got here yesterday.
Tom said that Mary is Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn the lights off.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back yet?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Seize the day.
What's that ringing, Tom?
He's very good looking.
The buyer beware.
Tom often skips classes.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can come out of it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was late, we waited for a long time for the rain.
You'll be all right.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary wore false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French more fluently than he actually does.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother is American.
Let it go.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx started to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
The bread is moldy, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked nervous.
Please, tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I make the decisions, Tom.
Don't blindly listen to the boss.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working well.
Tom became very ill.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom has always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got unpacked.
I like goat cheese better than cow cheese.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was the plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everyone having a good time?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Has that ever happened to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
That was awesome.
The chairs are cut from wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I need.
Where were you born?
Fuck you to the death.
Same-sex couples should not be able to marry.
The cow forgot she was a calf.
Give them this painting.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused right now.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Just give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister cut the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out that cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I believe her?
Who's that girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There is still no sign of Tom.
I was home.
Don't push me around.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's have a talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies breed other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposedly the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always cold.
They're all hurt.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very helpful.
He hung me up.
Did you call for an ambulance yet?
He brought it after lunch. Our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
All the lights went red.
John's at the airport.
Tom should have been ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience do the biting now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I have to work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My right thumb hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where did we come from? Where did we go?
I really don't know.
Do you have a scarf?
Tom is baking for attention.
Dan has no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one will bother you.
Tom didn't even think about that sort of thing.
There's a wind.
I'm just messing with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.

But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focused.
Tom isn't much of a talker.
You guys were right.
It's all happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
You gonna eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat any more, I'll be sick.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't upset Tom.

I have a bad feeling.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
He might be back tonight.

This is a leather belt.
Tom caught a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going to tell you.
Tom says he can pay it.
She didn't show up.
I'll give you a little credit.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you keep these suggestions in mind.
His speech is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't take defeat.
Tom is my husband.
What's in it for me?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back before the end of the week.
I want a room for one.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You are very passionate.
My headache is gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a little bit.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad about it.
Isn't that unusual?

Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom is still in bed.
What are you cooking?
This is your house now.
How about some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better now.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing what I want to do.
It's not my decision.
And despite our expectations, no charges were ever filed.
Lust is one of the seven deadly sins.

When will it be my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm the new student.
The baby is asleep.
How rich is Tom?
Obviously a typo.
It's not often that you get a thousand-dollar hat.
Are the police coming?
We have to find him first.

Tom seems to be quite proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She came.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're going to get her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was in three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat out very often.

We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
You want a cookie?
Who brought this?

Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
The room was quiet.
Everybody likes him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot in hell.
I've seen that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
It's cold in here.
To congratulate you on your wedding.

Let's just go and find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does your dog bark?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.

We had our reasons.
His reputation was at stake.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.

The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying it?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom dropped a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.

Don't you call me that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?

So that's where Tom is?
He spent the night drinking in a meat loaf.
I'm in there.
You need a date?

I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.

Don't forget these.
When will that be?
We're gonna have to re-order.
His depression ended when she kissed him.

Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.

No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.

You're not thinking things through, are you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures mean nothing to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.

That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?

No one went there.
Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You may be needed.

We're going to beat him.
It's all right.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.

You better let me do that.
This house is better than that one.
Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one is getting fired.
There is no one else.
I was on my way to New York from Boston, and I met this nice girl on the bus.

They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills has the right to be master.
You are very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some mush.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I hear you.
Give me those leaves.
You can have mine.
Tom wouldn't like that.
All comments are superfluous.
You did this for me?
Can you call for help?
Tom opened his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom isn't in the wrong.

What a pair!
Did Tom get up early this morning?

We need heroes.
No one can help you.

It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found him.
Don't take that too literally.
Tom is quite talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom is crazy.
I'm leaving and that's that.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what happens.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom is cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom has been pretty busy lately.
How can I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's got the starling.
I'll go and look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without hardship.

Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth out with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
You seem to be right.
He ran away to avoid capture.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.

Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a pool, grill, soccer field, and a pool table.

We are all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While eating pizza, he was annoying his sister.
We should have quit earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
Why are you doing this? I can do anything.
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heating.
We're all the same.
I want to be with you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
That sounds perfectly reasonable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I will not bow.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned the computer off.
She bought it at a butcher's.

These are wonderful.

I'm eating the pasta.
Can you translate that?

I need a ticket to transfer them.
The noise has stirred the whole town.
A man who likes flowers can't be a bad person.

That is ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
The women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom might be wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom is acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
They're very good.
You want to see a movie?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, and second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience is bored.
I raise cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you around.
I had to take something.
I trusted them.

You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could have done more for you.
Tom is no longer seen.
I think we're finished.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They had completely renovated the facade of the building, and I didn't recognize her when I drove by her.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's only fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom has forgotten.
Invite him to join us.
It's not gonna be easy to pull off without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I gave you a sedative.
This is not relevant.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply troubled by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing can happen to us.
There I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm going to get a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar is leaking.
You're going to get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes snapped.
The geyser spews a jet of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom continued packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't like it.
Tom is in charge.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's a relief.
He's very shy, says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get a hold of him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be polite to the elderly.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go and find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're a pretty good chicken whistler.
It was a beautiful day.
I was getting ready for a picture.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was just having lunch.
Tom remembered things that no one else could.
You can easily tell them apart.
I'm going to go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I counted to 200.
Keep this.
Should I go?
She looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How many did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did he borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
You made your point.
Can I have a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm going to lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That is ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is there a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what I have to do.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be all right.
I've got something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a lovely anchor.
Go see if Tom is in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return to see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it?
I'm going to find someone else.
I'm starving to death.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders are making a web.
You really talk a lot.

How will Tom get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.

It was a beautiful night.
I think I might be suffocating.

You are a true man-hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who's responsible?
I mean it.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
No one is talking.
What gave you the idea to contact them?

It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was amused by the music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom turned down Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party would start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My feet still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
I may have fainted.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to anything.
I was watching you earlier.

Nothing bears more resemblance to a lunatic than a drunk.
Take Tom with you.
Tom started to undress.
I know Tom is suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate with all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.

We're surveilling the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me that he would like me to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'll have everyone thank me.
This is where we'll be.

Humans cannot perform miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their society.
Those who mix the verb endings -s and -s will have a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
I guess they're everywhere.

Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
I came to bring him a gift.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is that?
Can people really be so foolish as to think that the entire population of Georgia, whose language is a Caucasian language that has neither a common phoneme nor a common alphabet with English, can fully master English in just two years?

Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.

This is beautiful.
Tom, don't play the Tosho with me.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check in on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I got him something.
I was gonna say "she".
No one deserves to die.

I need to spend more time at work.
Under what circumstances would I do that?
I'd like to get a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the jewels.
Luckily, the shuttle is stable, otherwise the storm would have knocked it over last night.

I don't need a heart scan.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
Everything seems to be pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.

Did Tom really do that?
I didn't even know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a talk.

Glands release chemicals into the body.
It wasn't my idea.

I was helping.
Music is unifying.
This is just a simulation.
Good to see you, Tom.
I felt kind of sorry for her.
He's being overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.

Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get in here!
You could have said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It's going to happen soon.
Hey, it's sticky in here, get me out of here before I choke.
What will be will be.
I've heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom was going to say.
Is Tom alone there?
I will find her.

Do you feel guilty?

This is the best ink.
Let my hair down.
Can you speak up?
Where's the meeting?

That is so stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more enduring.
I like it.
He went before me.
Give it back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
Someone might have followed them.
Tom might go to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a purse.
I wish I had met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
She's almost gone.
The children were so excited after the party that they could not sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read him the book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?

Throw them off deck.
Japan as a country has many different qualities.
It's very upsetting.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.

It worries me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom is laundering money.
Have you ever kissed?
I try to avoid them.
So you said you could swim?

Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb creme, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom fooled you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom is doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option.

There's no way that was Tom.
I'm going to kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's in there with you?
What are you getting so excited about?
Nothing is good enough for Tom.
Tom went away angry.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be good at oils and engine lubricants.
How was it yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have some breakfast.
I'm salting my own omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got you, didn't they?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at 10:30.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic building blocks of living things.
They're holding her up.
I have to go change.
How long have you been a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Our Chukunbabu died the day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I have claustrophobia.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
For your information, I don't care about that.
No, I'm still a widow.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That's weird.
This is the work we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She gave me up.
Why do you pretend when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I've been so wrong about her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom Archie. What are you doing?
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the septuple.
It's not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the window frames yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad to hear that.
It was like I got a slap on the wrist.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar?
How much do you want?
Tom is losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcohol?
You and I are going to be on the same plane.
Tom isn't coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom is not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll keep that in mind.
What time does the class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to go.
You guys were amazing.
I'm not gonna give up until I find out who did this.
The alarm went off.
The bird picks up the branch with its beak and flies off to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom is not the same man he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom is pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to make time for you in the morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of it.
What am I to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
Now is not the time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got clawed by a cat.
Tom is not old.
The question is how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is his best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has curly hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's a powerful one.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question of time.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was offended.
I feel guilty.
How did you know Tom would lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is a deaf-mute, in other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've been looking around a lot.
We want more money.
It doesn't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom is getting something done.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe in us?
I pay my respects.
Have mercy.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those are my couches.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Let me see your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should make it a habit to brush your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom is a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late for me to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to light your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He was lying to my face.
I'm going to go find her.
I wanted to leave.
They listen.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
We'd only get in Tom's way.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I memorized it.
I have nothing to give you.
They found a secluded beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on edge.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very dry explanation.
Walking before breakfast is refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I resent his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all anxious to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt backwards.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
That was a good dinner.
Get a grip on yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, division is not.
I'm getting all upset.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
They're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom is going to go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what the papers said today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom snorted loudly.
It was better.
Tom started to snore.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a little while longer.
We're keeping two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed to her.
Tom may be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was crazy.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why ask me?
Why did you pretend that you were hearing about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My glasses are smudged.
So, no, it was no.
I didn't mean it like that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the pencil flag?
- Settle down.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're going to try, aren't you?
Tom went without food for a week.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Though I am a pious man, I am a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I should know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so mad at me.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing the same thing as Mary.
We need to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom drank in silence.
I got hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary stopped him.
We met at the meana.
How did Tom act?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom is not dismembered.
I guess it's our job to make sure that doesn't happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got a curve.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house is cursed.
You baked the bread of eternity.
Pigs from marzipan don't burp.
Tom regained consciousness.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at that.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I got back.
I still don't get it
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on already.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We left there at 11:00.
You can ask me anything you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a raise.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is from another dimension.
They bore me.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for that yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't get her joke.
This is the ugliest snowflake I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is clearly frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me give Tom a message.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We are not criminals.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't you touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that topic.
You are righteous.
I'll be right there.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom.
Did Tom buy any gifts?
You two are so cute together.
You look really pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You've dislocated your collarbone playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show is over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is going blind.
You really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was impudent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom is on a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom yell.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Let me take care of him.
The stone was rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom is just crazy.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
I don't think we should comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
Tom was swimming at the time.
The Penguin is very cute.
You're such a geek.
We're sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look pretty.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave the house for slippers.
I think Tom is a schmuck.
She was sick with a terrible infection and her ovaries were leaking.
I don't need advice.
This is not worth it.
It's not an option.
Tom is heading for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's funny sometimes.
We would have hanged them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a second.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in the justice!
What does Tom say?
Why not take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You are influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake of capers?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to gossip.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language has a different way of seeing the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pyjamas.
There you go.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas. He was a great cook.
I don't think Tom will want to come and drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find it, anyway?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We must not give up.
We were under attack.
He is an atheist.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we've been dating.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's warm enough for the Demmequiris?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm pissed off.
Do you get stuck in it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling you.
I lost track of time.
This island is U.S. territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your scrotum.
Are you still there?
You are predictable.
I was a little bit nervous.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy these things.
Not here, not there.
Phone directories are fascinating.
No need to be so polite.
This is the best pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things never change.
