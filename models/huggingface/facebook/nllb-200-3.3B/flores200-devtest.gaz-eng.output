In the few tree species that have a digestive system similar to that of humans, they have difficulty getting the amino acids that their bodies need from plants.
Worse, failure to do so has many consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available genetically modified food is the whey and barley, which contain protein, but this is as heavy as animal protein, as we would be if we cooked it outside.The most prepared plant material was the protein found in the whey and barley, but these are difficult to digest in our animals without cooking.
In addition, animal feed (goats, ducks, eggs) is not only easily digested, but also provides high-quality protein containing essential amino acids.
Everything must be kept in mind, and we should not be surprised if our genes solve their protein problem, because that is precisely what the chimpanzees in the sauna are doing".
Sleep-wake is the process of waking up at the normal time of sleep and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
