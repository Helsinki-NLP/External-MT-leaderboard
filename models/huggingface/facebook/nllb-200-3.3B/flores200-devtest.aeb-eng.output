This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the colour and arrangement of these feathers.
The researchers say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on the upper and lateral sides with a pale or carotenoid colour.
The discovery also provides a great insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a fully developed skeleton, they were termed "vertebrae", but had other features of feathers - such as small bumps and protrusions. Researchers have found that the vertebrae were probably the evolutionary ancestors of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or for observation. The researchers suggest that although this tail of a dinosaur was small, the specimen showed the plumage of a large individual rather than a small chicken.
The researchers said that although this was a small dinosaur tail, the isotope showed adult bird feathers rather than feather plumage.

Chief of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had violated the court by covering their faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car broke into the house, they were not harmed.
But the driver took a serious blow to the head.
The baggage claimed by the accident was seized by the timekeeper and the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was taken to James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He has been transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Addoye has since appeared in the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh on charges of murdering her son.
Her arrest is pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses could be questionable because her photographs have been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have held that the publication of the photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "it seems that journalists are going in a dangerous direction if they publish images or anything about any suspect".
The Crown Prosecution Service said there would be no further comment until the alleged perpetrator was charged.
The document will clarify, according to the leak, the boundary dispute, which is claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics that are claimed to have been discussed include the future status of Jerusalem and we consider them to be an important issue for both peoples and with them the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Ghor for ten years, after the agreement is amended, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a permanent one for five years.
Sensitivities had to be closely monitored before the introduction of complementary pest control, the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
A partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia has selected qualified volunteers for the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Organization, the four hunters selected for their first hunt had been given comprehensive safety guidelines and training.
Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is the fifth by-election for Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which turned violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections due to be held by 2011.
Almost 60 cases of malfunction of the iPod's overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had 27 hardware-related incidents in mind.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating phones, which the company classified as "not serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's call for a delay by stating that it was "very unfortunate".
The quake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GST).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that they had not been notified of any damage in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus in Manila and took two tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far .
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, and the Filipino photographers.
Then the cameramen took a woman's seat who had to go to the bathroom. They shot Mendoza.
Legends follow him and he is a doctor.
He trained as a doctor and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Budgins investigated preterm labor during his free time, while working at the hospital.
Research has shown that the administration of hormones accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Shenhua said government investigators found the flight recorders of the so-called black box on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers have mentioned us well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first mistress, Luna, died on New Moon Eve. She was a strong woman, a unique one".
"Goldstorm" Runnels said, "" She was as strange as she was... perhaps even more so than I am... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place. """
In a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four per cent of respondents agreed with this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In terms of the two conflicting views in the poll, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was also in doubt due to his injury, and had to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the three heats of the Commonwealth Games.
I cannot take pain medication because its use is prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people checked the discovery using various devices and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Astronomers are interested in understanding how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed from the impact of comets centuries ago.
Kummo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political and ridiculous gossip".
He may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology as opposed to the older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no additional public transport and underground trains will not stop at Wembley, nor are there any car parks, parking facilities or bus stations.
The fear of transport shortages has made it possible for the meeting to be held without an audience.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday on the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador .
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden said the evolution of new species took two generations too long - although they had previously thought that this process took much longer - due to cross-breeding between the resident Darwin's gecko, the Middle-earth gecko, the migratory gecko, and the Late Cretaceous gecko.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be broken into smaller shapes.
It can be drawn in a thin thread that can be twisted and rolled. It can be tied or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin, and is glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was used for hours to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH number of the chemical, and an indicator of this number can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of the red cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or the alkalinity of the chemical.
The level of hydrogen peroxide is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical that you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together and rub them with a clean cloth until they are ball shaped.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro have toilets with a drainage system in almost every house connected by an advanced sanitation system.
There are remains of sanitary sewer systems in the houses of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were often part of the public baths where men and women bathed together.
If you're calling someone from thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives and reflects the call at approximately the same time.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts some of the light and vision.
It would take a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically; but its most important contribution to us is still providing a faster and easier means of transportation.
We have a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
In a lower order are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to ducks and deer.
Many small cats (including the domestic cat) eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs .
A lions' family consists of up to three adult males, with females and cubs numbering up to thirty.
Females are usually more closely related, being a larger family of sisters and daughters.
Black cats serve as pack-dogs or pack-wolf, and these animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior and killing of their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well) and swim and leap long distances and can lift five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are members of the same order (genus) as lions, spotted tigers, and leopards. All four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not exactly a lion's roar, but it is more like a roar of angry words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all animals that the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the original cats tracked and hunted the animals by their sense of smell; they could also smell where they were on the ground.
It can be seen well in the dark with night vision abilities, and also moves very well. The pygmy leopard hunts its prey to hide in its environment and attack it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group of population to which it belongs (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or are moved to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment involves different resources and competitors, the new group will need different tactics or strategies to take on a stronger competitor than its previous competitors.
The indigenous peoples have not been changed at all, and they still require the same adaptations as we have.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarities to other populations gradually diminish.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups are so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. The formation of a species is considered to be a necessary and essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The moose was the dominant predator of its era, so it was not afraid of anything, except other moose.
Its long jaws were embedded with over 70 teeth that resembled clubs with another set in the roof of the mouth, meaning that nothing stood in the way of escape.
We don't know for sure, but he probably had a complex mouth. His diet included turtles, whales and other carnivores, and he was probably a meat eater.
They also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could be stopped.
Although most of the food is familiar, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual holiday items, such as wild boars, peacocks, lobsters, and a type of rodent called the otter.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men preferred to feast together and reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no cotton, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans did not eat beans.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods and considered it to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests attempted to serve the gods in ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard with access to a safe enclosure that can only be entered by priests.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the harsh Middle Eastern climate, the house was of little importance.
Most Jewish family life was outdoors .
Women were seen in the courtyard of the house, the stores were open counters overlooking the street. They used stone to build the house.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
The people of Greenland have been isolated. Norse mythology tells of how Erik the Red fled Iceland for murder, and how he traveled west, finding a land he called Greenland.
Apart from its discovery, the Eskimo tribes used to live there.
There were also significant differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, although all were Nordic.
If you watch the film National Treasure , you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence .
But that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the sheet, it is not a treasure map.
The text of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" on the reverse. The text appears at the bottom of the page, inverted.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known precisely, it is known that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was originally a folded bookcase.
So, it is likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on that fateful day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
France was ruled by the Vichy. They were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and served the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans had liberated the Free French Forces in southern France, and they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a shared culture of a large group of people living and working cooperatively and together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or state, thus defining the social fabric of a community.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization is the transmission of knowledge across many generations and the preservation of cultural traces and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Many small cultures disappear without leaving a substantial historical record and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to override the tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states ridiculed the central government so much that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world of football and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, slide hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians have competed in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the archipelago's ownership by Japan, it is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan was established in the 15th century and was called Formosa, or the Beautiful Island, by European sailors passing by.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
1895 After losing the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government ratified the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings, the Inchehuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Emperors.
Most of the existing buildings have been rebuilt on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was reclaimed and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world-renowned motion picture format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format in the late analogue film era.
Its production continues today, but more importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have the same aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually a rather complicated model, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this picture (how do I divide it by 12 to get the smallest integer ratio) is 3:2.
The width-to-height ratio is equal to or close to that of most common formats (such as the Advanced Photo System group of formats).
The oft-misused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamics while maintaining some order in the visual system.
The most prominent place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subject to censorship during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power she wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this purpose.
Central authority was vested in the Church of Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether the demands of the faith were being met.
Britain could have surrounded Germany by sea after the war had begun.
The strategy has proven effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although such blockades violate generally accepted international law codified in numerous international treaties over the past centuries.
Britain had blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, which threatened neutral shipping.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to submarine warfare not limited to its own.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, the nations vowed to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
Also, each ruling dynasty had its own era of unstable provincial division. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, there was a fierce struggle between several nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history as thousands of people died in battles to take the highest positions in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants and allowed the most ambitious to succeed above the rest.
The same applies to the military because military ranks are more based on rank than on ethnicity.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class sons in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to visit the Garh or later called "Hara" on the mountain "Nur" to meditate.
This cave, which has survived through the ages, gives a vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on a hilltop north of the Mecca Hills, and is virtually isolated from the rest of the world.
It really wasn't that easy even if you knew it was there. Once you entered the cave, you were completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear sky above the surrounding mountains. You can hear and see little of the world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC. The Great Pyramid is also one of the great pyramids built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Gizza City of Funerals" in Egypt's Mortuary Valley is home to many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), miniature tombs, temples and the Tomb of the Holies.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and other members of his family.
The "up" button looks like a "V" and the "down" button like a square without a bottom.
The upper mark indicates that you should start from the sides and bend the bow, while the lower mark indicates that you should start from the end of the bow (holding the bow in your hand) and bend it.
The fugal bow is usually played softer, and the luten bow is more powerful
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil , but do not forget that the curved print markings exist for a musical purpose , which is why they should be respected in general .
King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette and their young children (Mary Theresa aged 11, and Louis Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris amidst the bustle of the market.
They returned to Paris in the Calois and were greeted by a crowd of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen .
A crowd managed to force the King and Queen to open their chariot windows.
One of the gang at a certain time staged a parade of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the grieving queen.
The Filipino people have borne the cost of the US imperialist war to invade the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds that were issued on behalf of the Philippine government on Wall Street.
Of course the very large profits that came from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the greatest profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the organization exists.
The era of these events was called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a drive to technology or technological necessity to the conviction that there is some underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their appearance in technology that is controlling human destiny.
Two general ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that technological development tends to follow a path that greatly exceeds cultural or political impact, and that technology also has "impacts" on fixed, non-socially-related societies.
For example, someone says that the engine of the car will get us to the road development.
But establishing a nationwide road network for a single car is not economically viable, so new roads must be developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
The collective ownership of cars also increases the rate of road accidents, and this generates new technologies in health care to treat the affected bodies.
Romanticism had a great influence on the cultural determinism of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography was what produced the gods, and in time the customs and culture of geography were also created, and these were, as they were related to the place of the community, better than the laws imposed by force.
Paris is also famous as the fashion capital of the modern world, and Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It became famous as a centre of luxury around 400 AD and as such by 1100 AD.
It declined in value in the 12th century due to the return of the Crusaders and returned with its gifts of silk and spices, which were valued better than those found in Byzantine markets.
Paris is now called the fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th and 11th centuries and even the 14th century.
At first, the Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on the Hagios.
However, due to this and the resilience of communication channels, patterns in the West can be delayed by as much as 25 to 30 years.
In the Late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of this period was the Crusades, in which people began to use locks to tie their belongings.
A sustainable agriculture is an agriculture that is undertaken to produce enough food to feed a farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming - or subsistence agriculture, often called organic farming - is a simple system of growing crops in storage that is adapted to the climate of the area, combined with a method of crop rotation or other easy techniques to increase production.
Most farmers were converted to subsistence farming early on, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of like-minded individuals who are overlooked by societal norms and are allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be language, ethnicity, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures show their beauty in their dress, behaviour and language.
Among the most well-known methods used to explain the importance of socialization is the use of the social status of children who have suffered neglect, abuse, or abuse, and who were not socially connected to adults at the time of their birth.
These children are called "savages" or "savages". Some people have adopted lost children (usually their parents); in some cases, the children are abandoned because of the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have been abused as children or suffered severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some say they were raised by animals; others say they lived in the forest alone.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral cats exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are exactly the same as those of domesticated animals, such as fear or aversion to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more meaningful, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a supporting tool for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as a paper clerk in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and aims to ask questions, stimulate and explain actions that would be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
Children should not be raised in an environment that does not support care and education, but they can grow up in that way.
They know that the foster care system is a safe zone for children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The substitute must provide all the essentials that were missing in the previous rooms.
The Internet combines elements of both public and private communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction methods.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as novel motivational aspects by Eime and McCord (1998) to study audience reaction to websites.
The use of videotape led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few fractions of a second.
They say that a slave can tell if a person is lying by interpreting small expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper that the President's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess truthfulness.
He also proposed that these abilities to analyze human behavior be shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research identified two groups of Chinese varieties: the subtle and the visible.
Mutation creates new genetic variants, and selection removes them from the assemblage of expressional variants.
Separation and recombination allow random variation to occur between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins that could be obtained from leaves and bark, but these proteins were difficult for primates to digest if they were not properly fed.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites and egg) are not as easily digestible, but provide high protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problem in some way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna.
Insomnia is the process of consciously waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a mild stimulus to bring yourself back to consciousness without waking up once.
If your soul is awakened in the bedroom while you are asleep, you can put it in the other room, without having to make a pillow to stop it.
Other options, based on biochemical systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, one of the most common diuretics) before bedtime, so that one's urine will be cleared.
The amount of inner peace one has is inversely related to the amount of stress one has in his body and mind.
The less stressed, the more positive the life force is. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and contentment.
It can make everyone enlightened. The only thing that doesn 't make it is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been influenced by the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Awaken Kundalini energy through yoga poses and breathing exercises, chanting and visualization, with Kundalini yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the goddess Yuga. From the conception of the various deities, she cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, clashes of regimes, practices, and cultures had led to conflict between the two nations.
After the war ended two years later, former allies and enemies now began to fight a cold war.
This war was supposed to last forty years and be fought on the ground, on the path of proxy armies, in the battlefields of the war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman frontier.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across the oceans.
Tradition holds that the Navy's mission is to ensure your country's ability to transport your people and goods, but at the same time, to hinder your enemy's ability to transport his own people and goods.
A prominent modern example is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move people and goods across the Atlantic to support the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been more likely to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to grow up in the region, providing milk, hair, meat and skins with ease.
The breeding goats were generally reared in herds that fed on the hills or other pastures, and often grazed on the majority of the goats that were young or adolescent, such as the common herd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Carpet tiles were first made in England in the 16th century.
Although the early train sets were made of parallel plates, they allowed horses to ride them to make the trains run faster and more smoothly than the steep tracks that were considered too difficult at the time.
Railroad tracks were invented early to stabilize the tracks, but it was not until later that the rails above the tracks became more efficient.
These are the same rules that they follow, except that the iron is the same as the painting of the tiles.
Later, plate wagons were replaced by iron wagons. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were used.
Walking was the first form of transportation, humans began to walk standing upright about two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus (or Homo erectus).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not consistently erect.
The fossil record of the Australopithecus is dated to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coastal anthropoid may have been walking for as long as 7 million years.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be active in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly how symptomatic treatment works in many cases. However, if we don't want to temporarily solve the problem, we have to find the problem wall, and we have to contain it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the increase in population and the nature of the human well-being.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the nearby John Dunlap Press by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson.
In the evening between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, read by him to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The Dunlap Twenty-five manuscripts represent the earliest surviving copies of the document of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and the body of a bird.
However, there are many bird fossils that still show dinosaurs.
It has legs with outer protective layers and claws, and is white, and walks on its straight legs like a tiger .
Virtually all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in binary form.
The value of a binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the terminology of computer language.
Acute intolerance may not immediately produce symptoms. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made for symptoms such as vomiting which is common enough.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of a pack of loose medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Insectologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The word comes from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to sneak into humans.
Both "killer" and "bed bug" are known to survive for the duration of their incubation, and have adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a child.
A couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the child can be cared for by two other parents.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique to the field, experimentation is the testing that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
She accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms are based on self-sustaining cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external cyclic signals, have been observed in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A circadian clock is a self-regulated oscillator that cycles continuously so that no external influences are detected.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major studies to prove that DNA is hereditary.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or bacteria to insert their DNA into the germs.
They conducted two experiments to label either DNA using radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur protein.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are from the same cell line or not.
Mutations in cells of the same bacterial line can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas who want to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife and flora.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of a visit, photograph and information about this species of orangutan in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and meet other workers on the way where they left off.
In this dynamic mode of transport, each person is supported and somehow connected to the transport system based on their own car.
Recent science indicates that this carbon-based mega-economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the public transportation system. Everyone complains about the public transportation system.
It is rare to hear in developed countries such complaints about the quality of water or the quality of the water table being overturned.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental that is missing?
Traffic is the study of the movement of motorists and individual vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately , traffic studies are difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted one hundred percent .
Fortunately, the codes tend to behave within a reasonable range of patterns; this is why traffic has a reasonable pattern, and can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to bend their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a larger range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot be folded today are dragonflies and water fleas.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that our solar system revolves around the sun.
Some found it to be true, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river in the world. It has a volume eight times that of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the world's longest river, reaching up to 9,66 km (6.3 mi) in some places.
The Amazon River provides 20% of the water flowing from the planet's oceanic rivers.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone construction of the pyramids continued well into the ancient Egyptian Empire, the pyramids of Giza are far superior in size and technical excellence.
The ancient people of the modern kingdom were astonished by the remains of their ancestors, which had lived more than a thousand years before.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most of the state's employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, where all of these elements are found in nature in their native form and can be extracted in a relatively simple manner using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that all things consisted of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also assumes that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a combination of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are also naturally occurring minerals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon .
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could take the place of the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people who showed up.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the use of the pencil has decreased and its place has been lost.
People are now texting on the PC instead of outside .
The slave asks what the master will give him so that he can get something more recent.
The fission bomb works by collecting energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy box over a hill. It splits the core again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms are unstable, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. This is called the outer layer of the Moon's crust.
The shell is about 70 kilometers wide from nearer shore and 100 kilometers wide from farther shore.
It is less wide below Maria and wider below the hills.
There may still be a lunar hole on the near side because the crust is less dense. It is easier for the haze to rise to the surface.
The search for content theories is not something that excites people or makes them angry.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously to be fulfilled.
These theories look at what makes some people like what they do and what makes them like what they do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that may cause managers to begin to lead in their former colleagues, one of which is to try to be like the others".
Such managers have difficulty making good decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and accounting for personnel.
And then, one becomes an outsider who feels obligated to change everything the team has and does.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior leads to frequent conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria of distinction as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical collections.
They often had greater autonomy than members of traditional teams where their teams could be assigned to different time zones that might not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" has been described by Larson and LaFasset (1989, p109) as a unique component of the virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management and the Invisible Team sets the criteria for each member.
Why would a particular organization want to do an educational organization in a long-term process ? Innovation is one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
To use all available resources efficiently across departments in an organization can be seen as creativity and innovation.
As a result, synergy can be achieved within the organization to overcome obstacles to focus on new innovative actions that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
(Angel (2006), defines sustainability as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, serving to narrow the field of research and making it much more specific.
The association between neurology and behaviorism supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is also a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behaviour in an automated manner.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling and being able to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
These things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are used to create many applications for home PCs and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Many times, teachers like to take their students to places called parks because they have something that is not usually offered.
The technology provides a solution through virtual field visits. Students can view the museum's artifacts or visit the whale tank or enjoy the beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Also doing a virtual field trip is a great way to think about a particular trip and share experiences with the next departments.
For example, every year students from Bennett College in North Carolina design a setup for their trip to the state capital, and this setup is redesigned every year, but retain the online versions of the steps to be used as the register.
Blogs can also help improve student literacy.While students often begin their blog experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes over time.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers often seek to improve their content to avoid criticism.
Blogs encourage students to be smarter than their peers". The need to capture the attention of the public inspires students to be proficient and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Note-taking is a tool for collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "allow students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online content, students can determine their own attitudes toward what others write, as well as their own opinions on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital city and home to a collection of art galleries and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is found in the far south, and in the north lies the beautifully preserved and largely untapped natural habitat of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things have made Ontario look more like the Canadian thing in the eyes of the public.
The major northern regions are sparsely populated and some are virtually unpopulated.
In a comparative demographic analysis, the number of African Americans living in the United States is more than the number of Canadian citizens.
East Africa is an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states or are linked to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.

Women: Regardless of their social status, women travelers must declare that they are married.
A ring is a good-looking ring (but not the most expensive one).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment and that they are used to being watched, or held, or turned away.
Be tough on men, and don't be afraid to be right about yourself (don't make cultural differences a thing!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Merinae used the new city of Casablanca as a strategic port named "Nava" after its foundation on the route of the Berber navigation in the 10th century BC.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, to avoid the damage caused by the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Mughal sultan as Dar√¥ al-Bad√Æa, and was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least-visited shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods in the whole old city, such as mills, pottery, leather goods, linen and all kinds of cheap goods, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda .
In 2002 the lava from the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the downtown.
A visit to Goma is a must to understand the ongoing war in the North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is a base for the Niragongo volcano and one of the cheapest ways to follow the African mountain gorilla.
You can take a motorized taxi to get around in Goma, and the usual fare (local) is about 500 CFA francs for a short ride.
Apart from being a little difficult to access, the word "tumbuktu" is used to talk about foreign lands that are far away.
Timbuktu is now considered a poor town, although its reputation has been eclipsed by a tourist attraction district, and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stations for Henry Louis Gates' PBS series African Wonders of the World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, which is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krukudaya River to the south.

It is considered one of South Africa's top tourist attractions, and its park is one of South Africa's major national parks (South African National Parks).
There are daily maintenance and access fees, as in all South African national parks.
It may be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card , which will give you access to a select group of South African parks or to all of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a popular tourist destination.
The matrixed structures depicting the Hong Kong skyline resemble a bright grid that appears over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong , leave the island and go to the Kowloon Pier on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of coastal sand dunes in the world, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) into the remote areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the forest is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just the mangrove swamps; they are some of the last evidence of the dense forests that once covered the Ganges Delta.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres , of which about one third is water / marshland .
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 wild geese in the area.
Trains depart from the Inter-Regional (River Cross) station in the middle of the day although most, especially the Eastern and Jakkar/Pomthang trains, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full , it is advisable to buy tickets in advance.
Most of the area is served by the small Japanese coaches , which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Baro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ouyapoque Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Ouyapoque River connecting Ouyapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-de-Louis, French Guiana.

The bridge is scheduled to begin full operation in September 2017, at the same time as the completion of the Brazilian customs points.
The Guaran√≠ were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of conflict between Spanish colonists and native groups.
The Spanish had a colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina has a reputation for having some of the best team and polo players in the world .
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December, at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
In addition, you can watch smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.

The official currency of Falkland is the Falkish Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands, which is in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted anywhere in the islands and US dollars and Stanley credit cards are often used.
In the outlying islands credit cards are not accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the landlord beforehand to see how you pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency in the island, so it must be exchanged before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is likely that it will be winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be very cold: a few degrees below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the weather cooler than the thermometer would indicate.
The amount of rainfall remains fairly constant throughout the year, with no "rainy" or "winter" seasons.
Although many animals in the park are familiar with humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of at least 100 metres between the tank and the beaver, and 25 metres between all other wildlife!
As manageable as it may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are big, they are wild, and they are dangerous, so you have to give them their own space.
Also, be careful that bad smells do not attract bears and other wild animals, so do not scratch or cook food in the open air and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa and is located on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.

The park is near the beaches and river mouths from October to April 1770. It can be reached by an hour at other times.
The rocks are present, but few of them attack humans. Most rocks are afraid of humans and will run away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Reservations ensure that the traveler will have a place to sleep as soon as he reaches his destination.
Although you can find other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, arrangements for airport transfers or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve your reservation if you have time to think about the reservation or if you need to take other documents to your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be sent by way of a travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.

The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont is the most difficult driving stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, where it passes through isolated forested terrain in a regular fashion.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be warned: there are always steep inclines, narrow passages and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are lower than in the earlier and later sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km / h)  and their strict enforcement is the most important.
Surprisingly, the surf is much more intense here than in many other places along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, much like the pastry of its southern neighbor, Austria.
The pastry is very good everywhere where apples are baked all year round and cherries and plums are baked in the summer .
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. And they are especially popular with cake with a strong cup of coffee.
If you like small, rich pastries, try a Berliner, a Pancake or a Krapf , depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of potatoes and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be "salted" or "distilled" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in South India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout Indonesia, as there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia.
But if used without any additional terms, the term implies that the dish originated from the central and eastern regions of the main island.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simple dishes, the most common flavours favored by Javanese are cocoa, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is the support of a rider's legs that hang from both sides of a saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's leg falling off.
If a rider falls off the horse but his leg is caught in the hook, he may be dragged if the horse escapes. There are many precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most horses wear riding shoes with high heels and very narrow soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially the English saddle, have safety bars that allow the passenger to fall off the saddle and to be pulled back in the saddle during the descent.

Snowsports on slopes, which include skiing and ice skating, are popular sports in which the slide to the lowest point in the hall covered with snow is on skis or a skateboard that is attached to your legs.
Skiing is a major tourist activity and a large number of enthusiasts, called "ski-free hours", plan to spend an entire vacation skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing in uncrowded areas or skiing trips or ice hiking.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but is not generally associated with skiing or mountaineering, which are practiced in very steep terrain and require more rigid skis and longer shoes.
