The Prague stock exchange is down to minus at the end of trading
The Prague stock exchange has adjusted its losses after the morning crash.
The transactions with shares of the Czech Energy Industry Company (ČEZ) represented almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague stock market immediately began to decline on Monday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the decline.
We also see the market's reaction to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives that rejected the financial sector stabilisation plan there.
The fall in shares in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock index fell almost four percent during the trading period but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange's stock fell more than five percent, but eventually losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6% according to the index there.
"The timing of the American rescue is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets", noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the central bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the US legislature should immediately resume negotiations and adopt the financial system's proposed support.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries will feel the consequences.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a draft financial system support, which would have cost $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion crowns).
The legislators thereby ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indexes recorded their biggest decline in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell almost 7 percent, the last time it fell was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the House of Representatives had not accepted the proposal, the index began to release.
Congress backs down: the US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
They're gonna vote on this early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in the negotiations to approve the bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system (about 12 trillion crowns).
But there's no win yet.
Congress must finalize some of the details of the agreement before it can make public the final form of the law and its vote.
The draft financial aid will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee.
Senate sources say the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to the farmers, there should be a notification of the approval of the rescue plan, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there is subsequent 'discovery'.
Paulson: The plan needs to be effective.
"We've made a big step.
We have resolved our differences on what kind of package to stabilize the market should be", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, to Bloomberg.
He says the final vote could be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Saturday night to finalize the government's funding.
It should buy out unsold mortgage assets from financial companies that cause financial firms to suffer serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
'We are close to a final agreement on a project that will work and be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair project still needs to go on, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
Indication of trade in Asia
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the sharply falling stock markets.
Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said that the legislature is working to have a final agreement in Congress by Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on Asian money markets, where the congressional decision could be the first to affect trading on Monday, given the time zone.
But it's not clear yet when both houses of Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the last-minute hearing could be delayed due to some problem.
The legislators hope the law will be passed in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
President George Bush has requested that the first $350 billion be made available as soon as possible.
However, Congress can block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later at $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not doing its job.
Bush has assessed progress in the negotiations
While the president may veto this resolution, Congress can overturn its decision.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained to acquire financial instruments to purchase bad mortgage securities that would lose their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We've worked it out.
The bill should be able to be voted on by the House on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bilateral efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on the final payment of buses
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who led the negotiations, said lawmakers agreed on the financial program's liability, taxpayer protection from losses, closing of benefits, and timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called bus payments of directors participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this and made great strides toward a deal that will work and benefit all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should issue new repayment accounts on mortgages it purchases in order to reduce the monthly repayment accounts of debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
What is the meaning of the word "spiritual"?
David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, said the proposed plan is a good idea, but it's going to be very difficult to implement.
"All this is because you can't know how and at what price you're going to buy the problem assets.
This will be decisive in how the financial sector and the government allocate losses among themselves", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Marek says it's not that important that the plan be approved now or early next week.
"It is more important that Congress decides this week that they will support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of having an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
The two-way matchup: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make a phone call.
It makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons why you should buy a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
You're probably having a hard time getting a top-quality, expensive record player home to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, these musical products do not appear on the bakelite plates, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
But if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz, or blues records, you're probably dreaming of playing one.
It's similar to travel, which is compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
Some people may find it unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it hard to accept a $20 marketplace headset.
Two extremes where there's plenty of room for everyone.
There's a wide range.
The life of the elements is also important.
Some high-quality music players are capable of more than just playing music, but also of what most mobile phones do not by chance.
No device today is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can take pictures.
Multi-functional phones have their drawbacks.
The more features you use on your phone, the more times the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy consumers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than 10 or 12 hours, usually much less.
In this respect, musical players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap phones, you can expect them to be out of your game for a few hours.
If you even use a mobile phone, get another charger for your workplace for safety reasons - this applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players won't have that problem, even the worst ones can handle at least nine hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem is when you upload music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards without an adapter.
With a few exceptions, the iPod does not need any special software.
You just need to load the device from the computer to the music via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already have their own library of music sorted by the artist, album, genre name or user rating.
Some devices only display a structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating systems).
Players are easier to handle, mobile phones know more
When choosing a particular device, you should be interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of handling.
If you are primarily listening to music in the background and only listen to it for a short time each day, such as on a tram, any MP3 player is a good fit.
And that's what any mobile phone can do.
You don't have to pay much attention to what music formats your mobile or player can play.
MP3 is a problem for everyone, and the vast majority of the music you get will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most widely used and, in addition, the vast majority of devices also deal with WMA-style music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and to purchase the song or album.
This service itself can be a compelling argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the providers' offerings are shallow and generally limited to one-hour radio broadcasts.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way music is sold (whether on GSM, the Internet or wireless) that will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he feels like listening to something, he's poking his cell phone in his pocket while his forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry earphones or at least speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the most likely benefit of music phones is the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get quite a decent walkman.
But most of the time, you're limited by the lack of a conventional earpiece.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3,5 mm diameter hole headphones can cost up to 15,000 kroner.
The advantage of players is, however, among other things, their ease of handling.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection) are really all people's problems.
Minimal function, handling similar to the previously common tape recorder or phonograph is obvious.
There is no risk of a crash in the accidental mobile internet form, or the subsequent massive bill for data transmission.
What device to choose
The most affordable mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have access to interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
If you add the appropriate card, you'll be able to get up to 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB or more.
Only the most expensive can figure out what to do with up to 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irver.
On the basis of capacity (maximum 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kr.
If you're in a more demanding audience, choose a special mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have separate MP3 control buttons, which makes the handling convenient to approach the MP3 player.
The industry was led by Sony Ericsson, which has walker-series phones with the same user interface as its MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to 4000 kr, but with a higher memory capacity (about 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Yet something is missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classic providers to cut substantial prices.
Maybe it won't be like this for long.
We have written on the A.Mobil.cz website many times that Czech providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
The latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges may therefore lead to a potential conflict - some Czech mobile phone service customers will find text messages from abroad cheaper than their home customers.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
That might sound contradictory, given that we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed with Pavel Dvořák, the chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council, who has stated several times before that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic provider with its own network is likely to have little chance of getting it (although it is likely to be difficult to find frequencies).
But there's another option, the virtual service provider.
It was the move of virtual providers to the mobile market that brought about a significant price decline, which was followed by the classic services.
Even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile came to market in the UK, we heard sounds like ours.
However, it has been shown that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
Yet, we do not need to go too far for example.
In February this year, we informed you of the launch of Mobilking in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that they can focus on a much smaller target group.
It requires far fewer customers than a traditional service provider to operate efficiently.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus tend to be low-cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, but often being offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a target group can be a good bet.
This service is specifically targeted at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - who they like, who they can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether we can adopt a view similar to that of Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesman, doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small compared to the segmental approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with the services it provides.'
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone providers claim that there is no chance
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking is more likely to take place in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It has indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they do their best to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has long been keen to launch the virtual service provider, thus taking a further step towards making Telefonica O2 a true competitor in the corporate customer market.
"We are very interested in providing our customers with not only wired but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better.
We have discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in negotiations", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
From unofficial information, it seems we might be lucky enough to have the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
But his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
"At the moment we do not think that a full-fledged virtual provider has a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special unlike other markets.
We have not been so far impressed by a diverse subject offering a complex and serious project in this area", Vlastimil Sršeň, press officer at Telefónica 02 told Mobil.cz.
The other providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, exceptionally agrees with O2 and adds: "We have not yet recorded a single viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which to build further".
And he added, "It's unlikely that any virtual service provider will be available on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we should have a concrete agreement on the table to think in such a short-term way".
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From a customer's perspective, that's what we consider the most affordable.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to partner to build shared networks for fast mobile internet.'
Responsible offices - on a leash with service providers
The mobile service providers' behaviour is easy to understand, and the entry of a new service provider would increase competition, lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
So why facilitate entry into such a competition?
When the service providers are able to cooperate on something important, the U:fon's roots are also evident.
The biggest pressure on ČTÚ was probably put on the birth of T-Mobile's U:phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the CTU website.
But right now, U:fon is coming up as a good argument for why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider access.
Martina Kemrová added: 'The mobile market competition environment has recently been marked by the entry of the fourth mobile provider into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services imposes high demands.'
However, given the mobile phone providers' attitude, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulators is quite surprising.
However, it is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition.
The Competition Authority shall be the only authority to do so.
But the Bureau is characterized by its attitude to the whole problem.
'The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible if the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure had been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional providers,' stated Kristián Chlapua, of the Department of Foreign Relations at the Economic Competition Office, in response to our question.
A statement so worded by the representatives of the providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, it is more than strange that the Office should represent the interests of consumers and, inter alia, ensure that no one is able to recover from their market situation.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers generally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decline in the price of mobile services".
However, it is likely that the interest of ÚOHS does not include the correct functioning of the market environment and the pressure to reduce prices.
In this case, the very tangible consistency of the three mobile service providers' responses is truly shocking.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with gas stations, the exact same gas prices are probably just a coincidence and a hard-fought competition.
'The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither provider has a leading position, i.e. no proportionate responsibility for its market activities.
The telecoms regulator is likely to lack the tools needed to open up the mobile market of virtual providers", Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of discussion.
There is of course an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, which shows that telecommunications is the only market in terms of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always required for the existence of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment, it's necessarily dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, there should be minimal evidence for UOHS that three mobile carriers behave in a markedly similar manner.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all the providers.
The assignment of responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common tactic in telecommunications whereby the ÚOHS takes its hand off the whole case.
We've met this guy in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Law did not allow the extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the UOHS should know well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, some virtual service providers, many of which are already operating on Czech mobile networks, remain unaware.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service lists, but which are only partially public.
Because they're multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
These companies' listings usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic is that the company is acting against the service provider as a classic business customer who orders large quantities of SIM cards.
As a preferred customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile service providers' commercial terms prohibit a similar pre-emption.
"If there were cases you mention, it would be a breach of contract that we would be dealing with and could lead to the termination of cooperation with that company", Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that news of such activity would not have reached the people responsible for the mobile service providers.
The three companies mentioned above may be in the first place thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no provider is defending itself against such a procedure.
These companies have a considerable profit from their activities and, unlike real virtual providers, are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of the potential problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that their phone does not have a SIM card in their name and therefore cannot have it in full as general customers of mobile operators.'
But that's what the CTU should be strangely about.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
If mobile providers are blind to a similar process, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a relatively strong right to disclose such activity and, if it does not wish to, should not be satisfied with the explanation from the service providers that they did not suspect any such activity and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a marked decline in the prices of services.
In the meantime, virtually in all countries where virtual providers have been established, traditional providers have been trying to prevent them more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this time that regulators intervened, which did not protect the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual service provider that others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are taking the whole case to one another.
In our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertain competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If a service provider allows the establishment of a virtual mobile service provider, it is difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not get more expensive phone calls.
There are four new versions of the new Czech anthem.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented the new recordings of the state anthem Where Is My Country?
The national anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlavek.
There are four versions available - male or female soloists, choral or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlavák considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he has deliberately selected young representative vocalists who are expressive and popular to sing solo variations.
"From the beginning, both of you and later the orchestra, I tried to keep the lyrics clear, clear, and harmonious", he recalled.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where is my country?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously took it for themselves.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after Czechoslovakia was established in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven national symbols.
What is the "new" hymn?
The Prague transport company will ship on Wednesday for the first time with a chip card.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger to board the subway, train and buses will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon can currently be obtained by about 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day coupons and an annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can also save them on their chip cards at the Transport Company's information centres and destinations at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the transport company's website www.dpp.cz.
By the afternoon, the service had been used by more than 400 customers.
Those who are starting to use online commerce may eventually forget about the subway station ticket windows, where they regularly have to wait in long lines for tickets.
The voucher can be purchased online and added to the Opencard card in one of the 13 accounts of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a stand with trained servers to help interested people shop online and save their purchased coupons to their cards", said Martin Opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic vouchers will also be saved to Opencard in some self-service vending machines installed in the hallways.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket holders, and passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská subway stations.
"There are five of them in the city now, but by the end of the year they should be eighty", Opatrný added.
The coupon is checked by the driver instead of the automated
The machines that start tomorrow are simple to operate.
Just put in the Opencard chip card and the prepaid coupon will go away on its own.
Electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area from tomorrow.
So the trains and bus stations around the city are 300 to 499, which are mainly used by people from Central Czech Republic to travel to the capital.
"On trains in Prague with integrated transport, the trains were fitted with card readers to determine the zone validity of coupons", explained Filip Drápal of Ropid, the organiser of the Prague public transport calendar, who checked the tickets.
On buses around town, card readers are installed at the driver's desk.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card when boarding but also place the Opencard in a designated location on the side of the cash register.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so", Drápal added.
Passengers who travel on non-city buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service card saving machines.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the device's display.
The Swedes wanted a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Swedish Germans demanded that Šumava be annexed to the United States.
This is revealed in the letter that is in the collection of the South Czech Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that this was the wish of a group of Swedish Germans in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is also shown by a letter from a private archive that is now in the collection of the South Czech Science Library.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov requested the US president not to allow the re-ceded of the "Sumavai County" to the Czech Republic, which was taken over by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly interpreted the situation and we want to be sure in the words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors or enemies, but as liberators", the letter said, signing the words "People who bear the fate of Shumava in their hearts".
Since joining Czechoslovakia would give the Sudeten Germans, despite their supposed knowledge of Czech national character, only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US president to take over the protectorate over Šumava "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, it would consider this area a foreign country to us, oppressing and exaggerating the minority and contributing almost nothing to the victory of the Allies", the letter states.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is allegedly because of fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the president of the United States were to allegedly doubt the views of the Schumacher Germans, it would be enough for the Schumacher County to hold a referendum on whether its citizens want to become part of the United States and live under US patronage.
Although the letter's text may seem a little naive given the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians say it adequately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had the slightest idea that they would be expelled from the country, few of them recognized the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree on some sort of autonomy for the Swedes.
Others again hoped to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in Czech Budějovic.
During the war, Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German from Budějovice.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and sent him to the Holstein concentration camp, dozens of other Czech Germans joined him in teaching them Czech.
"They were confident that when they returned home, they would be able to speak Czech", Chalupa said.
He said that none of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported under the Beneš Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The emotional campaign is attacking the leaders
The most expensive road safety operation in Czech history.
This is how the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch an emotional media campaign on Wednesday.
The office of Prime Minister Alešebíček hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be on TV, radio, movies, the Internet, but it will also be on flyers.
You should warn drivers about speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
It is primarily for young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the commercials?
Emotional attacks, primarily human stories.
This is what the campaign's "bloody" slogan is all about:
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The phrase "you don't think" is in capital letters on the registration number.
And the blood test says "pay".
This must mean that a person can pay with his life for a moment's negligence.
The public is terrified by the ads until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of casualties can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were produced by Euro RSCG.
Pull it, let the drivers
"Drivers are subject to a drag-and-drop system.
For example, when they cross the red line, they 'get it' and thus save time.
The 'pull' is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need a media campaign, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks the driver's attention warning signs are less effective.
"If a danger warning sign is fitted, it will likely soon blend in with the environment and drivers will not be concerned", warned Kořán.
Because he would give back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said that in an interview published Monday by the Jedi Achronot Daily.
"We have to make a deal with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and wants first of all that tractors and bulldozers do not cross his path, as one of my best friends did, must surrender part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to the July attacks on two cities that killed some people and wounded dozens.
The prime minister said it would be necessary to find a special solution to the "Holy Mountain, sacred and historic sites" in the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work", he stressed.
Expulsion from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an essential condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace deal with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they must give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up the regular support that Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) terrorism provides in Iraq", the Prime Minister stressed.
Questions after the accident: Are passenger escorts on buses illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them. You can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether passengers and passengers could travel on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the escorting activity is contrary to the law on transportation activity", says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old passenger last week was likely caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, she was sitting next to the driver at the moment, in the least secure part of the bus, although she had two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly stop while the passenger is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
You have a say in whether the bus has a parking space under the license.
If the bus is not cleared, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency's long-distance buses have no stops; this was confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's director, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution with this ministry, and at first they wouldn't let passengers move.
However, this was withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can use the toilet on the way if they have their own seats.'
The law doesn't know the escort.
'There is no clear legal regulation on the role of an escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only defines the concept of an accompanied vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations", adds Hanzelka, a spokesman.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Department for Road Vehicle Operations at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law is addressing the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space on the driving licence.
And that's it", he says.
Buses may be urban, with stops and limited maximum speed, and inter-city, with stops and allowed higher speeds, and distances without stops and allowed maximum speed, with seatbelts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP's road safety expert, sees no fundamental problem with the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in the process of continuous progress, and we can compare the situation to the service on an airplane.
"It's not clear when turbulence will occur and the pilot will hit his head".
"But if the bus suddenly stops, of course, the laws of physics apply.
It's like on city buses or trains.
The safety of passengers must be addressed by internal rules", he says, adding that the problem is not solved by law.
Jančura is ready to end the services
Student Agency is the only bus operator to offer escort services.
He has 200 escorts.
The director doesn't consider their occupation risky after the accident.
"But once I get the impression that escorting is risky, I'll stop.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on board.
It would also be cost savings", he says.
The lack of escorts in his vehicles was justified by safety concerns, as explained by Alexei Litvin, the director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We have no escorts, we have been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it ends up with some kind of fatal injury", he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy
A young, plenipotentiary flight attendant who had been with the company for two years died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without a sign and stopped the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid the bus by a sudden maneuver, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jančura refuses to accept the fact that two reserved spaces for the passengers were also sold.
"These places are off-limits for long-haul flights, they're blocked".
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the agency is not waiting for a court ruling, but for financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment to the law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law, which has been under consideration for more than a year by the Ministry of Transport's 30-member expert group, could mean more precise information on the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"However, the group did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much about the point system as they are about the maximum speed allowed on the highway and mobile use between driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of escorts to be anything that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers", concludes Hanzelka, a spokesperson, adding that the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the labour services.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are growing in Frankfurter
The letter from the WestLB board to the bank's employees is not limited in words.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Frankfurt's Deka-Bank could create a "central capital market organisation for the reserve financial group", the letter published on Monday states.
WestLB has been recruiting a profitable 'competence block' into such a business.
Such a relationship could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the regional banking sector.
It's the reading of when a board wants to prove its acumen in difficult times.
The uncertain position of WestLB Bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only the EU Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalian provincial government that it is pressing the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, for savings customers, Deka-Bank, which is famous for its investment funds, and WestLB have long been concerned about a connection of some sort - Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly data, stated that a merger between a bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB was not meaningful.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, half of which are representatives of regional banks and half of the savings associations, instructed the Board to negotiate joint business with WestLB.
In this case, the capital market transaction or certain parts thereof may be discussed.
However, the negotiations, financial circles say, have only just begun.
Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector with 3000 employees, is not the first to be mentioned in connection with the consolidation of the savings sector.
For a moment in 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank was merging with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But nothing came of this three-fold alliance.
The plans were barely made public, the Hessian provincial government has spoken out against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks never met.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the link between Deka-Bank and regional banks has been raised again and again.
However, the last time Günther Merl, Helaba's chairman of the board, spoke out against the plans to merge with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need for a closer approach to the various public sector banks.
The first step after the Bavarian provincial assembly elections is now to see BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg link up.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further mergers increases, it may gradually run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a junior partner, although he has so far been much more involved in the financial crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba, excluded a merger with WestLB earlier this year.
If you don't, NordLB will stay.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the equation.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings and Loan Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of regional banks.
Finally, WestLB may be dismantled, which is not what they want.
Thus, the letter from the local board of directors also indicates that they are working toward a "complete solution".
How this fits into the merger of the individual units with Deka Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Italian Weekend"
This is Elena's first time, and this is Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her friend, and so everything is different, Luca says.
Behind us, beside a Kaiser five-liter barrel, stands a strong-bodied bearded man who is proving to about 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep his throat can be.
Elena first licks Luca's face, then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station at 11:45 p.m. for the "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" route, arriving at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are mostly for Italians, the fourth is for Brazilians only.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans were already singing alongside their flags, and they were already celebrating at night.
And so loudly, it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, leather-coated coat and wide, silver-shaped sunglasses.
She's been on the road for Oktoberfest for five years, and she's only scheduled three trips this year.
There at night, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would be a waste of money, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with Bavarian law, accident insurance and a German-language tour - a German language course Marco took in Frankfurt.
And buses are already hitting the highway at night heading for Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quieting down, the passengers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need their strength.
They rest in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several Italian buses also take a short break on the 8th motorway before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one last briefing, explains the war plan.
First, everybody put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of this is the inscription "Oktoberfest" with the letters "conoscersiviaggiando.it" next to Marco's travel office's internet address.
Second, "When the brewery door opens, run", Marco cries out in the morning.
"Running!" Running and taking up seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward because we're stuck, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, but scattered in the tent".
The one-liter jar costs 8.25 euros, Marco shouts.
And don't forget about the wine.
"Show the security guards how well they've behaved.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll be taken".
Third, "I'll be back here at exactly 11:30 tonight". You got it?
And now he's heading for Wiesn.
On the way, one man ties yellow hats to trees, signs, and even a large Bavarian popular party campaign poster.
We need to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people are reportedly drinking beer across the Alps, and 10 percent of all weekend visitors are reportedly from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrol police, assisted by Italian volunteers, and the Bavarian Red Cross, which has about 200 medical staff in the national statistics, leading the Italians ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British who are in need of the most basic medical care (about 60).
The Hofbräu brewery was particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even found in his speech that the German banking sector was not spared the crisis.
Because this happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Munich-based real estate finance firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies are worth 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate is only required to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, state-funded company Depfa has lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself to them on an extremely short term basis - which is no longer possible due to the uncertainty in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio also decreased moderately, from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net income from cash transactions decreased to zero compared to the same period last year, and income from claims and securities and the liquidation of credit transactions decreased by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, the reimbursement of interest on the taxable income and the transactions to the group companies, the 16% revenue deficit was relatively modest.
The former state financer first speculated on corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were later seized by Aeral Bank.
Since the classical state funding could not be profitable enough, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects, as well as in private-public-private partnership (PPP) projects between private investors and the State, and expanded its activities internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write down the value of the subsidiaries which have a 'significant impact' on the group's performance, it was reported fairly generally.
The fact is, the dividend has not been paid.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent on cross-border refinancing than other financial institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
The collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago has eased lending between banks as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance a portion of Depfa's loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion.
Hypo Real Estate stated that the group's funding needs are covered by the loan for a reasonable period of time and that the company is protected 'from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international financial markets'.
Other sources claim that the funds will ensure the refinancing until the end of 2009.
In contrast, Georg Funke, HRE's chairman of the board, stated that Hypo Real Estate did not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the market capability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now guaranteed.
It gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But the dynamics of the crisis and the immensity of it, they can't be certain.
It is also not conceivable that the funding should not be used to its full potential.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late Saturday night news reported the bank was on the brink of bankruptcy, even the temporary rescue of the equity could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75% to EUR 3,30.
In contrast, the bond market is doing pretty well.
While the debt of the first-tier has barely changed, the price of the back-tiered bonds has fallen significantly.
The crisis is particularly relevant to the liabilities of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and, understandably, to the maturities beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their stability is now to be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system following the outbreak of the banking crisis and the financial institution's almost-to-be-home takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-risk commercial banks are still ready to support the scheme, the payment of the fees can be initiated on time.
Or something happens that almost no one at the moment dares hope will be able to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports related to partial nationalization, the likelihood of a certainty limit has thus far been reduced to mere legitimate expectations.
Long-term creditors can have sleepless nights deciding whether to get rid of their investment.
Short-term investors may nevertheless use the sale to make a reserve on taxes to be paid on exchange rate profits in the coming years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to show up at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start laughing: "The German girl is a total "caviar"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word manga - in her new comedy blog she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was already on my way to school with a fever.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, heading for Kawasaki, and I'm 40 minutes away by train from Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, and fortunately I didn't go wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to get up at 8:00 until 8:40 a.m. when a short conversation with the teacher begins, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt, a blouse, blue kneecaps, and a black leather shoe.
So I was standing in front of the cathedral in this dress, trying to say everything correctly: "Syahonara, vo no Sylvana"... My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to have started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, whispered and whispered, and I kept hearing the word "café".
I knew that from my manga.
It's a Japanese girl's basic word, and it means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly got back to my seat.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide, and she felt honored to be seated next to the exchange.
The rest of the clock was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran off normally.
Everyone was talking and laughing and they were asking me questions and they were making a hole in my stomach - and it was quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everyone unpacked their bags.
My host made me a lunch like this - a whole different kind of sandwich than the boring German ten-pack sandwich.
I got spicy rice, sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit, and a kind of tofu-roasted meat.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan most of the time.
The food looks weird and tastes completely new.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well, yeah, maybe except for the salted silk, brrrr.
In Japanese schools, the entrance is not just a lunch.
A girl may present a boy with a handmade benton, which she makes especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch.
I read about it in my manga.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it's just charming".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comic book and the culture that it depicts, I started learning Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are very valuable here.
Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, but it is also rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And with everything so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo was the greatest city I had ever seen".
Rats have feelings too.
If a rat or mole is in danger, does that mean you're afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we determine if they feel the same way when they are acting like us?
The online magazine Edge has been publishing articles by famous scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE has published a series of answers to the question "What do you think is real without proof?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as we study other species and we sort of sort out the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we get to a difficult field because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it pretends to be dead, it runs away, or it attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, leading some researchers to draw comparative subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits related to human consciousness almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/ managerial functions).
This vast area is higher developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent from other organisms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as our awareness of who we are, or our ability to design and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that we are different from other major brain regions.
Another dramatic feature of human language is that, since a significant part of human experience is related to language, consciousness is often said to depend on it.
In this case, the animals may be excluded.
But even if the consciousness were not dependent on language, language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness might be like in other animals.
If consciousness is not measurable as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware, it is not analyzable from our own experience, then research poses serious problems.
Most of my coverage is about the content of conscious living, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of main memory, particularly in the example of visualization.
However, in this hypothesis, which was also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: They may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this assumption also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the development of visualization.
What does that mean for emotions?
I'm going to point this out to an emotional system like fear that is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain's localized immune system (or its consequences, such as body reactions) takes up working memory.
Emotions are thus closely linked to areas of the brain that are typical of primates and especially humans.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is also subtle, because words and linguistics help us to distinguish and categorize states and describe them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions stem from simpler activities of the brain stem and the body's sensory regions, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that span the species.
I can't disprove that purely theoretically, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what may seem fearful to rats and humans is likely to be fearful in both cases: How can you check if rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cockroach fleeing danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, just similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience.
And while neural comparisons help us further, rats and humans have similar brain types, frogs don't have brains.
But is the brain responsible for emotions?
And even if it could be proven in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even frogs (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their emotions are suspectly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm more interested in the emotional behavior of rats than their emotional emotions.
However, progress in this area is at the neural level, as long as the measurements in rats and humans are the same.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't research emotions because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem like a shortsighted attitude, but I'd rather move forward than keep hitting walls.
I'm a practically emotional person.
Platini, President of UEFA: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashyunik of Ukraine said that the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence in Ukraine in the UEFA decision on Bordeaux and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine can host the European Championship together with Poland", said Vaszyjunik.
"But this does not mean an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much work to be done in both countries".
Both host countries are lagging behind in terms of stadium, road, hotel and airport construction.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at a fast pace now", said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"We will be kept under constant surveillance by UEFA".
In Poland, they are going to take a more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN federation after several scandals, which was replaced by independent Superintendent Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
'We have assured Michel Platin, President of UEFA, by letter that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 EC.
Only last season, several top-flight teams had to be relegated to the lower division for manipulation, and eventually the league schedule had to be postponed.
The angry Dennis Quaid is backing down.
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, spoke about her personal life in the interview, and now she's gotten cold feet with her ex-husband, and Ryan, the Hollywood star, called her ex-husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
Who understands and cuts back
Late Rose War by Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-husband: Two Hollywood actors are having a nasty fight with each other seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Ryan first stated the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain".
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him with.
The mental stunt was for Ryan's new press release, "Women", which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid responded firmly to the call of an unfaithful husband: "It's awful", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is unwillingly repeating and recounting the story of our relationship".
In addition, it is "sad" that 16-year-old boys, Jacket, are repeatedly "repeatedly reminded publicly of the pain and change that divorce brings to a child".
While Ryan has been single since his divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered a twin.
So his answer ends with the following page cut: "My life goes on anyway.
I can be happy to have a wonderful family where everything is in the best of hands".
Airline tickets and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European airlines and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
A recent study shows that air travel in Germany has become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Airline and hotel room prices have again been lower - as a result of a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed the booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant drop in prices in the second quarter after the price increase in the first quarter.
After the hotel market has been rising for years, housing has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6% lower in the period from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this in the low dollar exchange rate, which has led to "a sluggish traveling appetite among American tourists".
The decline in hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, a European record.
The first quarter also saw a rise in airfare prices.
The increase in the price of kerosene caused passengers to pay an average of 7.1 percent more per tourist class than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class tickets decreased by an average of 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but for business and first-class tickets the prices changed only slightly.
Prices in Germany fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9%, and fell by 23.6% in the second quarter.
The study showed that the price of domestic air transport in Germany fell by half.
The reason for the decline is partly due to the slowing economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the airline market.
On the other hand, the competition pressure is increasing as a result of the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the USA and Europe.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
HSV is 1-0 down Gladbach.
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV came out on top.
With Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a viable team.
Kristoffer Klein is a great deep-flight for national champion Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player was late to play and his lifting bounced back from the gate.
His well-spoken message convincingly left his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", said Hermann Rieger in the hallway leading to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physical therapist at HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying greater authority than some of the most promising players.
Thus, his request was granted at the competent place.
Assistant coach Jol Cornelius nodded and agreed to point his thumb.
Cornelius is the head coach of Hamburg, Martin Jol's brother.
His command would have been like, "Here's the second goal".
The execution of the order is delayed.
"Today was not always a beautiful day", later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "dreamed it up" earlier.
The 1-0 goal result is due to the head of the hamburgers, Mladen Petric, and the fact that the very weak Gladiators could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV is now 121 on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the sign on the projector, which featured their team as the championship's top seed.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it", said Marcell Jansen.
You realize that the interim record is more about the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly recovering from its late-committed assets - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Janssen, acquired from FC Bayern - it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and more sense", Jol demanded.
After the vote
Wall Street is filled with fear.
Following initial reports of the rescue ship's sinking, the Dow Jones has temporarily dropped 700 points.
It was the biggest one-day score loss in history.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's biggest stock market was down 5 percent, and it was at 10,579.
The technology paper trading Nasdaq plunged to 1,548 points, down more than 7 percent.
Dow's biggest loser at the time was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
Not a single piece of paper has been confirmed.
Goldman Sachs' stock has fallen nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
The rescue operation is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called doubtful mortgages.
However, the amount is not to be paid at once but gradually.
In return, the State would receive the bank's share option vouchers, which would be redeemable if exchange rates developed properly, reducing the burden on the State Treasury.
European and American and stock exchange rates declining
The billions of dollars in aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate's German bank stock market is down and it's taking Dax with it.
The US Dow Jones indicator is falling despite the state's planned rescue of the money market.
The dramatic exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (Dax) deeply into the negative.
The value of the Munich real estate financing company's shares fell by a quarter, despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20%.
The Dax has fallen below the 6,000-point mark of mental importance, and has scored 5,839 points at a 3.7 percent drop.
Stock markets around the world have been forced to kneel down.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to stimulate the financial markets.
Dow's first hour of trading was 334 points down, down 3.3 percent to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives has called for a rescue plan to be voted on in the Senate on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, in Paris, the CAC 40 fell by 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after its initial strength.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has slipped 2.1 percent to 18.286.90.

The Commercial and Tourism Group also announced that Thomas Cook shares will not be sold.
Dark matter is affecting spacecraft flight.
A mysterious phenomenon has been a source of disagreement among scientists for years, with dark matter affecting the speed of space probes during a so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for almost 18 years.
The fuel lines are about to freeze, and he's threatened with death by ice.
Scientists have been confused for years by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational pull of space probes to give additional momentum to a celestial body, such as Earth's gravitational field.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research mission, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
But what has puzzled scientists for years is that flying objects do not behave exactly as the ancient law of gravitation would have expected.
Instead, there are anomalies in the speed.
The probes are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which views gravitational pull as a curve of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, remains a firm believer that Einstein was right, and he tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found as close to Earth", writes Adler.
Space scientists only learned about the existence of dark matter ten years ago.
It's obviously a gravitational force that has effects on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself does not emit or repel any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up about one fifth of the universe's total mass.
Abducted tourists in Egypt released
After spending ten days in captivity, tourists stranded in Egypt are once again free, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros in ransom.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a shoot-out before the hostages were released.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Time and time again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is reporting the most important cases.
European tourists stranded in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arabic TV and Italian media.
According to Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their health status", Frattini said.
Five German, five Italian and one Romanian nationals, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, state television reported.
19 of the Desert Expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
Further, the reasons for the hostage-release shootings remain unclear: An Egyptian security official said the hostages had already expressed their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom", the official said.
"The trial was about hostage taking", when suddenly the surprise occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers and arrested two on Sunday in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which one of the hostages was to hand over to the German wife.
The Al-Maszri al-Jom newspaper quoted a German spokesman as saying that the hostages' release was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
The report says hostages will release female hostages after the ransom is paid.
Men are held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Suicide Led to" the Violence of His Stepfathers
He testified in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, County Cornwall, has spent six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of attempted sexual assault.
The Criminal Court of the city of Heathrow has learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of her confessions, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for her death".
At the hearing, it was stated that Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at his home in the Mutley area of Plymouth on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes and blindfolded her before sex while her mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His step-mother moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing, it was revealed that Ms. Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was being haunted by the nightmares of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been a passionate surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead" and "rejected from life", according to her friends.
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his Plymouth apartment.
He probably choked himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a falling out with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his testimony in a letter: "I always tied her up and blindfolded her.
I didn't sexually harass him.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure that was terrible for your victim, especially when she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family affair ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more remarkable, though, is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might have never been brought to trial".
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the effect that Stephanie's parents feel your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
If that had not happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful, happy young woman".
An official who lost important data has been charged
The BBC reports that a government official has been charged with breaching official secrecy for forgetting top secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on an expert mission from the Department of Defense when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were delivered to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the smallest charge of a violation of the law and there is no suspicion of intentional assault.
Frank Gardner, a reporter for the BBC's Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal affair", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which deals with the retention of information.
The state's attorney's office has suggested that the prosecution against the officer be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the man's rather sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included covert intelligence on al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi military.
They notified her of the decision on Monday and then moved her from her home to an unknown location.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B bill
UK housing co-operatives can expect an account worth more than £80 million after the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank was rescued.
The government has spent £14 billion protecting the 2.6 million account holders of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies using the depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), said it was "disgusting" that the companies and their members should pay.
The repayment of the 14 billion important loan will ultimately be made after the repayment of the signatures of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
However, the accruing interest is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives were among them.
It's annoying that institutions that have been so cautious... are now having to pay the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We've learned that every company has to pay at the rate of the amount of deposits they have, and the companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must set aside £81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the Housing Companies' Trade Union, told the BBC that he considered the move unfair.
'It is outrageous that institutions have to pay the bills of much less cautious institutions that have been cautious during the housing boom.'
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since it started operations in 1945.
"We need to look at this case from all sides in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from the significant bill", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, a full annual interest rate may be paid, which may be at least twice the current rate.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest on their deposits.
The price of milk is rising by five pence per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another five cents per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two penny increase in February and following a survey by a consultancy.
Retailers shall decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Rejected a request from a former member of parliament of Bangladesh to defend himself freely
The Bangladeshi court has rejected the former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, which means he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court denied him the right to defend himself on charges that he had been blackmailed by a businessman for 50 million dollars ($729,700) while he was a member of parliament.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country's military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions for his release do not clearly indicate whether he will be able to maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he's now going to appeal the appeals court's decision to the Supreme Court.
"The appeals court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application saying that she was not needed because she was already temporarily released and was undergoing medical treatment abroad", Rafique Huq's lawyer told us.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal".
His lawyers argue that he needs to be defended in order to return to the country and prepare for the December election.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the military-backed provisional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges brought against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have been excluded from the recently organized polio vaccination program because of Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesman said that this was despite the Taliban's pledge not to attack or disrupt the work of thousands of staff who are vaccinated.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV was rejected
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Law Commission's decision to reduce its interest in its rival ITV was rejected.
The Court of Competition and Development ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission previously found that BSkyB's stake impedes competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, BSkyB reported to the Competition Authority that its stake in ITV was undermining ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Law Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin's CEO, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervisory board all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV stake was a meaningless and disproportionate compensation, in particular that BSkyB had stated that it would be willing to relinquish its voting rights.
The U.S. Attorney's case is under review.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move followed a report by the Chief Inspector of the Judicial Branch on the case that criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalest.
The investigation was ordered because they feared the prosecutors would be dismissed for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, Special Counsel, will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation attempted to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious charges against the possible crime have not been investigated or clarified", said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with authority to compel witnesses to testify.
The series began in December 2006 when nine prosecutors were removed from their posts by the U.S. Justice Department.
At the time, they said the DA's were fired for their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the fired prosecutors received no worse reviews than many of their colleagues, leading many to conclude that the firings were politically motivated.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges brought against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting cases on behalf of the government.
They can leave anytime, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department at the time, Alberto Gonzales, was the target of attacks by the Attorney General over the firings, and he eventually resigned.
Several other officials in the Justice Department have also resigned.
In his report, the inspector general strongly criticized Gonzales' role in the case, saying that the attorney general was "primary responsible" for the firings, "abstained" from his role as a director, and "clearly withdrew" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former aide to the elder Bush, have been criticized for failing to cooperate in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic is getting recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf is getting a nod at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will take home her special gold medal next week at the London festival, said she was honored to receive the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, and they were nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genre, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is like that".
The song that Jim Steinman composed required a very high volume, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" topped the charts for almost nine years, and it has since sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been struggling with health issues recently, including having a heart attack in 2003 after falling down on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few shows due to a severe burn.
Later, it was discovered that she had cystic fibrosis.
An unknown street in the city that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, subways, and other sidewalks, some famous, others merely for practical purposes.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The little street is in the East Village and it goes north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and is much more like a dusty alley than a main road.
There are no street signs.
It's practically impossible to find on a standard map.
But the street has admirers.
There's Avalon Bay, the developer of the recently built First Street luxury building.
He wants to re-cover the Extra Place, and he wants to make sure he can get to the shops and boutiques in the new buildings on a cleaner road.
Among the street's admirers are the longtime neighbors who were caught by the bone in the street that it was the only remnant of the pre-renovation past of the neighborhood.
However, the owner of the street, the city's building maintenance and development department, has no interest in sticking to it.
This month, at a meeting of the local government area management committee, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street remain under city control and request a new plan for next month, said Susan Stetzer, district manager of Local Government Area 3.
"There is very little land in the city now, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city", he said.
"There may be proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would re-cover the small street and provide seating, some of which would be used by a coffee shop, which the builder is expected to lease an area of land.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that while the company wants to use the street, it's not insisting on owning it.
"The main objective of Avalon Bay is to restore this ruined gorge and turn it into a pleasant public park", he said, adding that the city had proposed its purchase.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Bureau, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the office's job is to develop the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say it was given the title "No Man's Land" in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among countless children and no one claimed the narrow strip.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for being the location where the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album cover was taken.
"It was a great location", said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, garbage, cans and posters, and woodcuts and rope".
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how the middle class took over the East Village, object to the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the community's possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Lost New York", posted a section of the Extra Place story on his blog, which appeared in the weekly "Foreign Rumours" section of The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small backpacking street, dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron storage windows and firewalls, and where weekly newspapers are carried by the wind in the canals".
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street at the end of the back door that once led to the CBGB, now part of a higher-cost clothing store built on the site.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75-liter beer bottle lay next to a discarded pile of fresh newspaper.
Some of the passersby said they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think it might be worth renovating.
Fields said he thought some people underestimated his appeal in the current condition of the street.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, grim, and disgusting places", he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English-speaking environment
In this section, Education Observer Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research fellow in California studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and director of education research, is co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's education proposals are included here.
According to the Obama campaign, "African-American and Hispanic-language students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and that's true.
To address these performance disparities, Obama's education plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
However, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English language schooling, outweighs his interest in overcoming major performance disparities.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a contract elementary school in east Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Hispanic and have low incomes.
More than a third of the students - many of whom are recent arrivals - are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of the fourth graders did well in the 2008 state math test.
It's equally impressive that 93% of fourth graders did well in English language and literature.
This incredible achievement was not achieved with the tools Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street is focused on repetition, practice, continuous skill assessment and rejection of objections.
In addition, and that's what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" students learning English in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We had the greatest success in making sure that if someone walked into a classroom, they would not notice who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier".
"It works", he said, "it works for us".
Would Obama set an example for other schools that teach Spanish-language and English-language students, such as Sixth Street Prep?
The school's results should be clear, but because of its own party's education policy (the National Education Associations have long been supportive of bilingual education), and because it itself consistently supports bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a disparaging statement about the issue, saying that people should not be so worried about legislation "only because it's English".
Instead, he said, "they should be able to teach their children to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to achieve reducing the gaps in outcomes, he should be serious about studying the models that work, rather than looking down on them and ignoring them.
Renewed economic concerns have led to a sharp drop in oil prices
Oil prices were down on Monday because of concerns that America's financial market bailout plan would not be able to boost the economy.
Crude oil stock plunged 7 percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock market has been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before falling again under the immense uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, concerns were reigniting investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached a deal over the weekend for the largest economic bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for long.
As the latest event in the ongoing crisis, Citigroup will acquire the Wachovia Corporation banking business, the government announced Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts say that as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "the rescue operation appears to have failed to stimulate the willingness to trade in the stock market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities such as oil is expected to decline.
"The future of the stock, interest rate and exchange rate markets has become uncertain worldwide", wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the global commodity market will not be spared by the pandemic.
The biggest question for the stock market is the extent to which the US 'disease' is infecting the entire world, particularly China.'
As oil consumption declined due to slowing economic growth, bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year by 20% and lowered their forecasts for 2009 for oil and gas prices.
With his second quarter bravery, the team set a new record.
After spending more time in the Jets' field than anyone else in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, who plays the defensive end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like this", Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals teammates played in full alignment with the sky's towering dark clouds.
Brett Favre, the quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, which was a perfect foray into an afternoon where their growing relationship has evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes this quarter, including two back-to-back cornerbacks who fell 10 seconds into the half.
"I didn't regret the effort", Favre said of all the passes given to Coles.
"He's a very good player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think".
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
The cornerback, Darrelle Revis, caught a bad throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player, went into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to get the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last lap would have been the most amazing move of the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets won, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, setting the score at 34:0.
That was the best score the Jets have ever had in a quarter.
When asked by Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the sensational nature of the game, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When told that the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter, the Jets scored none, Mangini said: "I have to say I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time".
The restless Gebrselassie is breaking his own world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best middle- and long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first person to run the mile in under two hours and four minutes.
With a comfortable 2 hours, 03:59 on the flat track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous record of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin.
At age 35, Gebrselassie set a career-high 26th world record in so many disciplines that he won or set world records in almost every distance from the 1500 meters to the marathon.
Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics last month fearing - perhaps in retrospect - that air pollution would further worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he invited me to the Berlin Marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions - sunlight, at 9°C at first and 13°C at last - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since unprecedented marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya turned to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won the 1998 race in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a sprained ankle and could not train for two weeks.
Obviously, he was refreshed during the forced rest and not intoxicated.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but eventually everything was fine".
He has received some criticism - particularly from his East African rival Kenya, Ethiopia - for using too many aids during his races, usually avoiding many world-famous marathons, relying on his track runners as if he were running on a course, and setting world records ahead of the race spirit.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the semi-finals on Sunday with four Kenyan runners in 1:02:04.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the beat after the runners were exhausted.
With a distance of just over four miles (4.8 km) to go, Gebrselassie took a final sprint to knock out Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving to his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the Kazakh-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German, finished a remarkable year with her seventh-fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The British Paula Radcliffe is the world champion with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised the world by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in the Beijing Olympics due to her alleged back injury, but she quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where she improved to a personal best of five minutes.
He won the race with a clever calculation: First, he let a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans get ahead and gain a significant lead, then followed them after running about 30 km.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with a time of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
In the park of experiences in Greater Orlando - a few miles from everything that is glittering, loud and mighty - lies a quiet little town where the pride and complexity of African-American life was born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as what she described in 1935: "Five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, and two school towns, without a prison".
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival, which is celebrated in Eatonville in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction - which is also listed in the Florida Roadmap published by the Federal Writers' Project for the Depression - is separate from its surroundings.
It was as independent, dignified, and secluded as it was in the 1930's, when, according to Hurston, black people in Florida, the city, often refused to share their true thoughts with white people, who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing".
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama encouraged open debate on the issue of race, many here are distrustful of the outsiders' views.
"We take great care to tell our story", said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to tell it right".
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
It's a historic model of black exposure, but it's also a community of almost 2,400 people where poverty rates are twice the national average.
Partly a literary hub, partly an example of the American slavery that has created, sometimes despised, sometimes praised, the southern, urban, black culture that thrives in the shade of the oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the inhabitants here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (who everyone calls Hurston here).
In his books written in sincere, strong dialect - such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The Florida Road Book, paragraph five, transformed the city along Route 17, which leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, as well as in drumming, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to the more trusted spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road is a modern public school, with a brown foundation with a white corner, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, maintained by Howard Miller, who can barely read or write".
She mentioned Dash's new husband, and she wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything you need at temporary accommodations".
So, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly, Fodor's guidebook showed you different.
This description didn't really appeal to everyone.
"She told things the way they were", reported 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters, who Hurston made immortal by quoting from the roaring songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as the living stranger who often visited his home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston entered the city, he usually arrived without warning in a flaming Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing long skirts in a city where people are still proud of their decent dress.
Most people were enchanted, Franklin said, but many were phytically enchanted.
"People were always happy to see Zora", Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, sitting in his chair, "I never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were never reprinted.
It seemed like Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
There were no major memorabilia or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, "Cutting in the Rain".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane highway, the Kennedy Highway, which played a major role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already entered the city's western border via Interstate 4.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still standing after a difficult historical period.
Forced integration has, among other things, ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, racial conflict was a source of hatred among the community.
"A group of white boys came by and threw oranges and other things at those sitting on the side of the road", Franklin recalled.
"There was a lady who died in it.
They threw a Greek chicken out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to force integration, stating that the Brown v. Board of Education decision "offends my race rather than respects it".
Today, residents say that while the desegregation of schools was positive in some ways, it weakened the cohesion of the Eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children were used to being killed - I remember - and you hugged your teacher in the morning and evening", reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit organization "Keep the Eatonville Community".
"It took until the students and teachers came from a common place", he added.
"We didn't embrace our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us", said Nathiri.
However, human rights helped to propel many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors, and artists who rose above prejudice, as she did, with such outspoken confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company?
This is incomprehensible to me".
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to regain her reputation.
Five years later, a well-known biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the bookstore shelves, which again established him as one of America's leading figures.
The road project was to begin just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston was seen as a savior by his old neighbors.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston Festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway.
Thousands of fans attended the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county withdrew its proposal to build a road.
"The fifth-level of the highway has brought the community back to life, connected to full speed, which is a real civic pride", said Nathiri.
Boyd put it simply, "Eatonville was saved by hard work".
The victory over the road project helped change the city's image of itself.
More and more out-of-towners, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began attending church here in 1993, began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
In 2006, the new single-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened on the re-packed and refurbished Kennedy Street.
Eatonville remains a Florida cocktail: not only 10 miles from downtown Orlando, but sometimes you feel like you're on a suburban sidewalk during the summer rains; as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They still take care of outsiders who come here looking for a story, a story to tell.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things -- like the oldest fresco in Eatonville, painted by a white man and depicting a black man working on the land -- are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their isolated community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, so did the pride of the hometown.
Young people in particular are increasingly seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with problems and with everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A genuine civic bond is silenced by the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job with the local government or police that he believes needs help.
And it seems that even younger ones have learned to properly characterize Eatonville, like the 11-year-old twin sisters from Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just pass by think this city is nothing compared to others", Alondra Kenon said recently after a Sunday service.
"But if you stop and take some time to learn about its history, it's a very beautiful city".
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newspaper vendor's booths and the huge TV broadcasters in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the middle of a storm.
They'd never realize that with their glass-walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who hold New York City in power are having their toughest days since 1929.
The runners still roam their metal tea trucks on the sidewalks, carrying muffin-packed baskets for morning meetings.
Still, Spanish-lipped men roam the brickhouses, wearing some fifty-five silk shirts as human calves, hanging on their shoulders in a yoga-like circle.
Office workers still line up for their breakfast sweet pastries at the sidewalk restaurants, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi every day between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I was planning on doing this on my local JP Morgan Chase bank account during the afternoon break, but I had about 20 people in line.
Not at the bank vault where you can cash out or pay, but at the customer service desk where old customers order checks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me - I learned later from Star, the "ordered-for" banker - lined up with the same intent as I did.
But unlike me, they've already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their home states, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their customers like family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has filed for bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was seeking a buyer for a $440 billion savings.
The office and store workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection transactions on Wall Street.
The average New Yorker has become an expert in finance in the last few weeks.
A woman at a local Chinese department store on her phone was talking about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed housekeeper in my apartment building, who's been a groundskeeper for 50 years, we're not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food supply, like we always do.
After I went to the bank, he said to me: "All my savings were in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim tombs were desecrated while Austria was lying on the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to present the organisation 'Women Against the Conquest of Islam'.
Traffic signs were shown with imitation signs showing mosques dotted with red lines.
The police say far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Austrian Muslim cemeteries that took place on the same weekend as far-right parties won a significant lead in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Trauni cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols on some tombs, such as the Star of David, but the investigators said they were only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stemmed from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said they were "deeply shocked" by the funeral, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscientious examination following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of political balance has shifted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria's Future, a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, has also expressed displeasure with the campaign against headgear and headscarves and food that is allegedly linked to Islam.
At the party's final assembly in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" that could prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both sides want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing manipulation of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election that brought the far right victory showed that the change was largely due to a young voting base who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign trip
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by a court.
The judges ruled that Glitter was banned for six months after he informed the authorities that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after presenting evidence to the court on Glitter's child sexual abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Magistrates' Trial in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent Police filed a request with the Ashford Magistrates' Court to prevent Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person".
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities of her intention to travel abroad because she is required to do so by the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If he fails to notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years.
Kent police said they don't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and possible locations.
A police spokesman in Kent told us: "The police in Kent are doing everything they can to protect children at home and abroad.
"We believe it is easier to monitor someone if they do not leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent Police believe that the primary duty of the police is to protect the people of Kent, and through close cooperation, we are continuously monitoring the conduct of registered sex offenders and those living in the county to minimize any potential risks to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed he was feeling ill and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities refused to let him pass the passport check, so he flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him into the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the local police and the Immigration Service insisted that he return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the uxbridge court in West London, as at the request of Scotland Yard, he was admitted to the sex offender registry under a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photos depicting child rape in 1999.
According to an Interior Ministry source, Secretary of State Jacqui Smith reassured and welcomed Glitter's denial of travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal perspective". Photographer Günther Bauer
No decoration, no hair, no dancing shoes.
Flamenco masters are in the flesh, without the excitement of performing, to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
The artist, on the one hand.
On the other hand, the average person.
And these two sides cannot be separated except in intimate moments away from the audience, when we can touch a personal movement, capture the depth of a caught eye, or marvel at the beauty of an artist's hands, empty but expressive, when they're not on stage.
In the German photograph series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, he combines the theatrical talent of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, he presents flamenco's distinctive iconography from different points of view.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco day by day", the creator believes, adding that the Flamenco-people "can be played by anyone, as the images make the observer realize that these images do not typically depict artists.
These people who are being lentiled on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and capture the audience.
But stage photography is not a way to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are deep within their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to embrace the personality of the great flamenco".
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas Festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997, taking portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
This portrait, thanks to the camera and the choice of subject matter, evokes classic photography.
However, the use of different stylistic tools breaks with traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's view of flamenco: "It is a music with traditional roots, but one that changes day by day and is always impressive".
It's not the dance, not the song or the music itself, but rather the artist's personality, character, that enchant the audience.
The main motivation of the works that can be seen in the El Fotomata Gallery these days is the search for a meeting with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
The names of well-known flamenco artists, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are a metaphor for this collection of photographs featuring over sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be released as an album of portraits featured in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the Flamenco people's concept differs slightly, the photographer adds: "I love taking pictures of people, getting to know them, and entering their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult art form in photography is portraiture.
You meet people, you meet people, you meet people you don't even know, or you just take a few minutes to take a picture.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my dreams come true.
The exhibition, which is a selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled Flamenco-people, can be viewed at the El Fotómata Gallery, at number 20 of the calle de la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "very cowardly"
The setting and plot are unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel, which is about an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who has lived in the Congo and the Amazon for 20 years.
The Nobel Prize-winning author admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work is "very daring" and "all indications that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't, but I will, and I hope to one day make it through", he concluded his speech at the four-day festival of ideas, ideas, and opinions in Aqueduct, which welcomed hundreds of writers, historians, and journalists, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary festival and he also fulfilled the hopes attached to it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend", which was voted by the audience.
A dedicated audience was greeted by Felix Romeo. The audience was soon struck by the hour when the Peruvian writer, with his amazing memory and a great deal of humor, told how his writing career developed from his special adventure of reading and his desire to live life; how he alleviated the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many improvements and rewrites; how his writing career was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories are based on his stories.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or prove whether books change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is just entertainment or a life-long experience", as it influences people and makes them think, so he urged writers not to be tempted by ease and to take responsibility for their profession.
The weather is getting shorter, so the goodbye at Pozoblanco and the bullfighting are missing.
Traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco festival, the horse bullfighting was cancelled yesterday morning after future horse bullfighting towers found the arena unsuitable for the fight.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided not to engage in bullfighting.
Weather conditions have thoroughly altered the celebration schedule, as two of the three events could not be held.
Saturday, the rain left the second bullfight.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought the Castilblanca bulls.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic fight, he was carried on his shoulders.
That afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won numerous accolades and trophies for his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the ageing reputation of the Los Llanos Arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of the loop.
A van carrying two tons of hay once tried to escape from a road check
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police conducts traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiño (Alava).
The authorities are stopping a van with two passengers on board, trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, over two tons of cargo, was not noticeable.
Investigators pursued the passengers, and one, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A. A. J., the Basque government's Interior Department said.
The man arrested is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armiño, where traffic controllers from the Alava Traffic Supervision Authority carried out a traffic check on the N-1 motorway.
When the van was stopped, the driver refused to comply, suddenly gave gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Investigators pursued him, and the vehicle stopped a few miles away at the stop, leaving the highway for a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hay.
The rear-end of the vehicle was loaded with fuel rods and transported by police to undergo further investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, the verification showed that the vehicle's false registration plate did not match the information contained in the van's documents and therefore the arrested person is also being prosecuted for falsifying public records.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing its investigation, aiming to arrest the other suspect who, as mentioned earlier, escaped from the highway and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police for the necessary interrogations, and within hours, court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the star of Melrose Place's popular series Amanda, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara, California, over the weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
"A witness said he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers", a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
According to the witness, at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, cried out to the engine, tried to leave the parking lot back and forth, and went backwards through the sunglasses several times".
Not long after, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "outraged for Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed to be a bit of a mess", so the patrol took him to a drug and alcohol testing center.
A police spokesman said the actress was cooperative and alcohol use was almost immediately prohibited, adding that the first impression of the officers suggested Locklear was under the influence of drugs.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified substance. He was taken to the local jail around 7:00 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago to treat her anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, IU's secretary general and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the organization will decide the case of former Seville Municipality Youth and Sports Councillor Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family members.
"I am a federalist by far in these matters and this matter is certainly within the competence of the Andalusian organization", Llamazares pointed out to the method of procedure that the party must apply to a former member of the Seville city council.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed that 'transparency' should be taken into account when investigating any irregularities committed by Silva: 'At IU it has always been smooth to ensure that cases of this nature are fully transparent.'
He added that training included "a strict code of ethics for employees".
"May's Blood", by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes was inspired by José Luis Garc, who cites the famous Spanish anti-French uprising in May's Blood, the largest film of his career, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the humanity and social analysis he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, which he told the audience of the actors in the film show Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two and a half hours of May's blood will be shown in cinemas on Friday and will later be shown as a four-hour miniseries on Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, realized his childhood dream with this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who was commissioned three years ago by the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the events of 2 May in Madrid.
The $15 million budget was fully financed by the Autonomous Community of Madrid and presented a special opportunity for Garci: a timely decoration and emblem to show "the confused Spaniards who mistakenly stood by a bad leader because the struggle for independence had left the country in a great backwardness under Ferdinand VII", he said.
However, the director expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of the ghosts of Alatriste or Goya, who were more than double the blood of May, and was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, he is noted with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the director of the Reboot took his usual approach, taking the scenes with the actors he had been rehearsing with before the filming, and the casting was not there because Garci thought it was "humiliating", and because, as he said, "the art of directing is to go to the theater and the movies to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in".
Several May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have not been in front of their cameras.
Garci - who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Academy Award - believes that Spain's nomination for the Hollywood Academy this year, meaning May's Blood, the Seven French Billiards Tables and the finally-invited Blind Sunflower, does not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema, "should be presented dead", he said.
Garci's film doesn't count on any awards.
"You start off thinking you're working for the future, and then you realize that it's all about success, and then you're happy when you're making another movie", says Garci, who has a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian flamenco dancer remembers a Sevillian dancer who is also a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
She was a free-dance artist and an expert on Eastern dance.
During her active life, she was a pioneer in women's equality, whether it be Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing bandages that restricted women's freedom of movement.
The war broke out in Europe, and Isabel Bayon was fascinated by her life.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa, and he recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me".
The flamenco dancer stated: "Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
The dance titles remind me of flamenco styles.
For example, the "flipping dance" is the guajira, or the "snake dance" is the tango.
"I was a passionate dancer, and others say that is my style", she says.
The show was highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, who is now singing again at Isabel's After the Open Door performance; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with an ex-disciple.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you agreed to the request, and it's a great honor to have you in my play".
In addition, the production features music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, singers El Pulga and Moi de Morón; drummer El Pájaro, drummer Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character who constantly besieges the real deity with his love".
The play depicts the life of a woman who lives in London but also travels to Europe and even to distant lands, including India, the United States and Italy.
"I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great influence on his age", says Bayón, "but his work is now less well-known and less appreciated".
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will be published.
The first illustrated edition of the diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The exhibition is part of a series of programs titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Regional Government of Andalusia to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
Thus, the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium concludes the re-issue of the work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet memorial and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Summer Tree".
The Regional Government of Andalusia's Cultural Committee obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes makes perfect people room.
Paul Newman was like that".
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on the film Victims of a Scene, and reflects the shock and helplessness Newman's death has caused in the American film industry and throughout America.
I mean, how hard it was for him to win an Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
And he was known to be sick,
But still, he scared everyone to death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and I've just lost a good friend", Robert Redford said in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went through a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-esteem and a desperate quest for dignity.
When times are so hard and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people left to look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, she embodied the beauty and justice of the plateau.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a champion of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation established in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his home-grown biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was struggling to overcome its culture of suicidal nutrition.
The wave of admiration swept through Hollywood regardless of nationality or origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, says he died not a man, but an age.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that his collaboration with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe called Newman, the bad boy from Australia, his greatest inspiration.
"He's set the bar for all of us", observed George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today try to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle of demanding honesty and privacy away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy, if at all, in today's media jungle.
There are those who try, and Paul Newman is the model.
He was divorced once, but then he was faithful to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, although there were certainly many occasions for infidelity.
"Why eat hamburgers elsewhere when the roast meat is waiting at home?" he joked.
Heaven can be proud that his daughters on earth are fans, which is not very common in America.
"In all his roles, he was not as proud as his role as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted human friend", they say.
The road to the Madrid Olympics
It's a dream for many of us to go to the Olympics in Madrid, and after 2012 failed, it could be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we really ready for this?
Because if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called the perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of many I've ever been.
It was a bunch of nonsense, and if you were to evaluate it once, and I was to be the examiner, it would be a clear failure.
But let's go ahead and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the serial number, because it had to arrive sooner.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go early, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid a later line).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, they just gave me the serial number (first, it's pointless, just to get there sooner) and (after the usual line), which is surprising, it was just an S-shirt (second, it's pointless, because I'm XL size)!
What kind of world are we living in?
Or did the crisis make you decide to save money on the material and buy cheaper, smaller t-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still fading from what happened on race day.
Besides having to go there at a terrible early hour to pick up the chip, the queue took 15 minutes to arrive and even the backpack had to be dropped off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unimaginable for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't give up our backpack, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more pleasant wait of more than 40 minutes, which was marred by attempted riots and stand-ins.
I think we'll have about 500 certain pneumonia by tomorrow, and some, including myself, will not be able to get our position in real time, because I assume my chip has been wrongly recorded to start.
If you were to ask me about the perfect running contest, I wouldn't think of it by accident.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual reception
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft unveiled the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence that's not too smart, but can do some basic tasks, like calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle that's on the company's territory) based on the information we've heard from the conversation.
This "receptionist" uses a camera and a pattern- and facial-recognition system to detect how many people are in the room, who they are, even what they are wearing, and to listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
In addition, you can group the audience based on the conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist identifies a third party, but she knows that she is not a member of the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he has visited anyone and assures him that he will be in a hurry to help.
All this without the blue screen.
It's amazing.
But of course, this is the music of the future.
The company currently has more important tasks to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have been pushing for Microsoft to change its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will contain fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster -- wow, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish fluid, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction is coming back.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is getting more and more backward, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome came online, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step toward becoming a competitor to Windows.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the interaction between hardware and software.
She's playing the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never go away, but it will be the death of the operating system, not in the absolute sense, but in the relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more attention to the web browser.
We turn on the computer just to open Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and we're spending more time browsing than we spend on windows.
What are most of the applications that go with the system for then?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be much, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less heavy, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services more online and ultimately to provide an alternative to Google.
They need Minder so badly, I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month in a Microsoft employee chat room in Redmond.
A poster on the vending machine calls them to use the company's browser, "Your browser.
In 2006, an independent survey found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week, they announced a new version of Windows Mobile 7 slide.
It's not coming in early 2009, it's coming in late, actually, it's coming in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, cell phones are increasingly functioning as computers.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
♪ Le Fabuleux Marcel ♪
This was worn by Pablo Picasso in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Cross, and it's also one of the basic outfits of the gay consumer community.
And when we consider the list of specialties, we might also recall the peaceful figure of the wandering circus' chicken-haired weightlifter.
It's nothing more than a typically narrow, fingerless male cotton cotton.
I mean, the tank, as the English call it, but none of the competitors with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, it is because of its elegant name - although it is only referred to as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to the sport, which according to legend is named after Marcel Cerdan, a boxer, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton, unisex design, distinctive emblem and small (albeit recognizable) Belgian flag also distinguishes Marcel from its competitors.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sportswear, retro boxers, cashmere bags, wool skirts, seamen's shirts, baby dresses, and even a mini-series - all are part of the company's products.
And they all fall into the category of comfortable underwear,
It's a shame that they have to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd love to be a young mother, no matter who the father is"
He looks a lot like his brother, but he's also been able to make himself real.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling is more than just some pretty, beautiful girl giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new Paris headquarters and the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It brings warmth and gentleness.
What are you doing in Paris, exactly?
We're introducing the new Mango autumn/winter collection that my sister Penelope and I designed, and we're also going to be presenting the second Mango Fashion Awards and the Gala Dinner at the Opera House in honor of Valentino.
It's a busy day, but it's exciting.
This is your fourth season with Mango, so where did you get the inspiration for this new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s, and we've taken a lot of things from there.
And then, I often go around the city and watch women dress, vary and choose their clothes - one of my favorite pastimes.
You're also a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
I think so, but after all, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and look in my aunt's closet.
Well, it was you in Canaan, almost up to a amusement park.
Then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to invent our own style for class and rehearsal so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you're really identifying yourself with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and I have all due respect for your designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I feel better than ever, I love the '30s.
I think women are really mature, experienced enough, and less likely to make mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't bother me.
Since I was a child, I have done what I wanted to do, and it fills me with great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother, because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's talk about the cinema, you made a few movies last year that haven't been shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and anxious, I want everything right away, but of course I know that's impossible.
I can't wait for you to introduce the Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you'd say to them...
As far as I know, you made your debut on the track a couple of days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go to the track as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she organized for her own organization, Women for a Better World, and I picked out two of her Mango collections, and the clothes were sold out, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much going on about him, I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the positive side of your business.
She asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if she wanted me to stand up, I would.
If the fate of women living in the Third World is the same, I don't know the impossible.
Drunk drivers who fall will be required to install the "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require the vehicle to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not enter the vehicle.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being considered by the Prosecutor's Office, which says the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the project is aimed at restoring traffic, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Office of the Prosecutor-General for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) are also participating in the experiment.
Statistics show that 30 to 75 percent of drivers who have been arrested multiple times for drunk driving are back in their cars.
Alcolock would prevent this because the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air inhaled, and if it is higher than the permissible level or if the driver has not inhaled the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument, which is over 1000 euros, would be the responsibility of the offender.
A related 2007 US study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to implement the reforms in the Member States, as it is not possible to implement them in the same way as the reforms in the Member States.
The instrument is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which is calling for the system to be fitted to school buses, as in France.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English precision, the Spanish Air Force's Transport Party of Asturias aircraft landed at 5:40 p.m. at the Benito Juárez Presidential Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting, but it was still so bright that we could only see the royal couple getting off the plane with our hands as an eyelash.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other high-ranking figures.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Duke and Duchess were coming to town for an official visit.
- Great, then there won't be an airport transfer for a long time today... the woman is from here or something.
- No, no, sir, the Spanish lady, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Asturian couple and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon of 27 Marines who will protect dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, dressed in a sea blue, and the Princess, wind-blown in her long hair, dressed in a restrained dress, but not in the usual, thumb-slittering shoes - perhaps warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They'll stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then walk into the room where the official bet is taking place.
At the entrance to their hotel - one of the city's four largest - they are joined by a reporter from a soap opera on Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion award
The most appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and among the most sophisticated and coolest fashion designers alive today is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second bid for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the youth talent of the fashion industry internationally.
The grand prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first bid, saw her own designer clothes on the Mango exhibition at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out for her impact.
Besides, it's the company's second largest European store and recently opened in 1,335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
Amidst the funerary event and the thanksgiving for Valentino, who presided over the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
The most pleasant Chagals were accompanied by a gala dinner prepared by Mango.
Nati, who had recently passed away with a heavy heart and sadness over the death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the ELAH's breathtaking jewels, and accompanied Valentino to his dinner table with his two-foot-tall son, Luis.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests, and they were so chivalrous, together with Baron Rotchil, that they were left without a suit, as they were both given as gifts to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store in her own design of pants and shirts, and at dinner she was wearing a sexy long black dress, and on the night of the opera tour with Gaya Toledo, she was so enthusiastic about the ballet room that she recalled the old days and rushed to one of the bars and a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace tour, but showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to admire Oliver Martinez -- he was about six feet tall and on a motorcycle -- and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, bringing his own towels and towels, and he made a good prediction that he would not want any perfume in the room.
The stars are under the starry edge of Paris.
Oh there, there's a life.
1001, the stress-resolving number
Not 1,000, but 1,000, and there's a way to get out of this chaotic, messy routine.
The good news is that we can find them all in one book, which will arrive in bookstores on September 30th to bring peace of mind.
It's almost painful to watch at 7 a.m., but even worse, to think about the accelerated life that the world is forced to lead every day.
The office's called a stress, and the computer's called a back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
But there is no one way to overcome daily exhaustion and workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classical massage, or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find a solution that suits their preferences and can be tailored to their free time.
The stress-relieving work is titled 1001 Relaxation Methods and the peace that flows from it is coming to bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress is hardly eliminated in the world of work or personal relationships, this handbook will surely move you in faith.
And in addition, it's also offering other ideas that can both help you relax, like tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it's time to sit back in your chair and relax and focus on reading.
♪ Who talk in their dreams ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about people who are upset and are fully awake telling what happened to them that day, but people who are talking in their sleep.
This phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This kind of well-meaning sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It's quite common, especially among children and teenagers.
I'm sure most of you have heard that he spoke at night.
The child may have a completely absent-minded routine (e.g., one time in a high-grade fever) or more regular (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly), and usually remember nothing the next day.
His appearance cannot be traced back to a single triggering cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime sleepiness, nocturnal enuresis, or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned earlier, it can be accompanied by a high fever, or even a stressful or aroused state of mind.
However, little has been studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, or consisting of unrelated words, murmuring, but it may also come in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and to consult a specialist, who can help you to determine if there is a problem that causes great anxiety and thus a solution.
As mentioned earlier, this is a benign condition, so there is no cure unless it is accompanied by another manageable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things we can do, and here's a tip:
Make sure that the child stays calm before bed.
Choose soothing toys and avoid making children watch frightening or more aggressive television programs or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or who find it difficult to relax are taught some relaxation techniques to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child sleep more peacefully.
If he starts talking in his sleep, we try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be superfluous, because the child is unconscious, but it would cause him to fall asleep.
Despite speaking, he's actually still sleeping and resting.
Remember, if you experience severe anxiety repeatedly, consult a counselor or find out what causes the child to experience severe anxiety.
If you speak intelligently (this is the rare case), do not start asking questions to get anything out of him.
It would be superfluous, though, since he is not conscious enough to gather his thoughts while sleeping.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech but not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful about what you hear and what you may conclude.
Never tell a child that they can ask you about their secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is that you don't worry, because this is just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally, straight to the Illhaeuser.
After a long dive, Illhaeuser's team finally took a new leap of faith and won again on home soil.
Although there was no big game, the Yellow-Black got into a lot of situations, and they took advantage of one and won.
The pace of the game was not too tight, as the attackers found it difficult to adjust to the rhythm.
The first shot was fired by the guest team captain, Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the top corner of the gate wall. Then the Illhaeusern came to the fore and the shots followed: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn's shot landed over the gate.
On the other side, the players were crammed into a block of defensive midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on the side of Dannemarie.
However, Illhausern's goalkeeper did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue the fight in the back of the head.
Dannemarie, however, was not able to take advantage of the situation, as they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who were only slightly backward to reinforce their defense.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a shortcut to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports, so the president of the republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president "in a constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with the meeting of the 'Crisis Committee', which was set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in oil prices, as the oil price exceeded the record price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, the President "will discuss with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
They've also restricted the traffic to Quiberon's yacht pier, but they haven't blocked the roads to Belle Isle.
They've set up roadblocks on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors demonstrated their determination, setting fire to tires and packaging before the gas stations of the ports of Brest at dawn, as demonstrations took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
Further moves followed in other ports along the Atlantic coast and in La Manche, such as Sables d'Olonne, Vendée, where fishermen were not allowed to board, and Le Havre, where about 20 vessels were blocked from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique district have lifted the blockade of the huge Total oil refinery in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, have decided to wait for a ministerial meeting on Wednesday to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the 'Crisis Committee' will have to decide on its next step and its participation on Tuesday at the meeting planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Some Breton fishermen, however, do not want their interests represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, since the committee has not supported their efforts.
"The strike continues", for example, Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the Lorient fisheries committee, reported, "because fishermen refuse to grant their demands" and "they refuse to travel to Paris".
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gasoline currently pay about 50 cents a litre, but believe that operating a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gasoline dropped below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The memorable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" died of cancer at age 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to the film legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, can keep up with plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008", said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for its 30 to 120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in the last eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, an insurance company backed by U.S. financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back its $85 billion in debt, the Financial Times reported.
In addition to its international life and U.S. pension insurance business, AIG would be free of most of its other business, the paper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday night to consider the sale.
The AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG intends to sell include the company's aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, the final decision on the sale has not yet been made.
AIG must quickly access liquid assets to repay the $85 billion of loans approved by the US government, taking the risk of acquiring 80% of its capital and losing shareholders in proportion.
Study by Paris Historique of the historic Morning Meeting session of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bailout plan, with the Dow Jones index falling 6.98% (which it has never seen, a drop of nearly 800 points) and the Nasdaq down 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index fell by 777.68 points, closing at 10,365.45.
The index's greatest drop to date (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
The Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technology papers, closed at a decline of 199,61 points to 1 983,73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index fell by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street market was already weak at the opening, and then when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a plan to restore market balance, it took off.
The House of Representatives rejected the funding requested by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson by a vote of 228 to 205.
The plan was voted down by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
"This market has filtered out bad signs because Congress seems unable to approve a plan", believes Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"It also shows how much the market was expecting this plan", he added, expressing concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is indeed doomed . . . , it will be the Fed and other central banks' turn to handle the crisis, and credit conditions will continue to tighten", warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "Every day, more and more financial institutions are going bankrupt" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking business to be acquired by its rival Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has suddenly accelerated, necessitating urgent measures to rescue banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the market has been "not only in the United States but also worldwide", adds an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has been significantly weakened.
The yield of the 10-year government bond fell from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday evening, and fell from 4,357% to 4,161% on the previous day for the 30-year period.
Obama won the first televised match
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be eliminated as winners.
Not surprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign leaders alike claimed victory in the televised matchup, which was watched by one-third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen says that while John McCain's performance was respectable, it was not "exciting" enough to stop his decline in popularity, as evidenced by surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup poll, the Democratic nominee is better at fighting: the results of a public poll published Saturday show Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most promising, yet undecided voters, 39 percent of respondents believe Obama will win, while 25 percent believe McCain will win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his lead with his party partner, Joseph Biden, making a promising performance on Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned over the weekend: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
She has good instincts".
McCain, in his seventies, never fails to put his own undisputedly vast foreign policy experience first, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" in these matters that were the focus of their first personal encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that"... - repeatedly said the attack.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", McCain said.
This is the main attack platform used by the Republican TV commercials that have been running since yesterday.
But Obama emphasized that he represents the future.
He didn't let himself be confused: he put it in a concise and accurate way.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the world's image of the United States.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does", echoed a Democratic ad broadcast over the weekend, pointing to the Republican leader's failure to assess the impact of the crisis on the American "street people".
"John McCain had a lot to say about me during the 90 minutes of debate, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered in a rainy North Carolina election meeting.
The financial turmoil is undoubtedly in favor of Obama, who the Americans believe is the best fit to save an economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next seven weeks could prove a turning point", said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator yesterday.
Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat and a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama has "as great an economic drive" as Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final judgment on the eight-year economic policy of bad behavior that George Bush created with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include creating potential energy independence for the country through the use of renewable energy sources and establishing a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues surrounding the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank bailout plan: the extremely unpopular plan was passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the capital to reject the expected result of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the polling stations, hundreds of white Russians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been released, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukasenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!"
Some admit that they did not even go to vote, and one young person says: "Why did I go?
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to show itself in a good light to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic change of regime.
If the election were to be considered fair by observers, they could lift the sanctions on the country, which denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and froze some bank accounts.
However, the opposition says the elections were not held in a transparent manner.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting", regretted Yuri Potyemkin, spokesman for the highly heterogeneous coalition of the United Democratic Forces, which was organized by 12 parties.
"The changes were only nominal", stresses Aleksandar Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case, that is the executive.
If the opposition delegates enter parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But getting into parliament allows them to get a seat on television, sit in the country's regions and make bills.
The opposition must therefore take a leading role in political life because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we are unable to recover, we risk falling under Russian rule.
We want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the election process, will accept the results of the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems too high and that the extensive organisation of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of voters took part in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks the Social Democratic leader, Alexander Kozulin, who was released last of his political prisoners in August as a runner-up.
No one was in the polling stations.
The parliament will have a maximum of five opposition members, the ones who are most suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night is once again in October Square.
And on television, President Lukasenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are happy to succeed.
Blood is safe again.
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and President-in-Office Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood donors in the world today.
Most importantly, he has regained the trust that was severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service became infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the tragedy and the general upheaval, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994 led by Judge Horace Krever to shed light on the circumstances leading to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever was delayed in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committees to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has completed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one for Héma-Québec, serving Quebec, and the other for the Canadian Blood Service Company, which provides all other provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec began operating in 1998, only 38 percent of people had confidence in Québec's blood supply system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years that followed, however, we were able to regain the trust of people by improving blood products and by working in the field". Décary proudly reports that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 percent of Quebecers considered Hema-Québec to be reliable.
However, Dr. Decary remembers that "confidence is a very fragile thing".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this time, a number of cases of new strains of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were detected in Europe, the doctor, who has led the company since its founding in 1998, says.
"We had no idea if this disease was transmitted through blood.
So we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that if we are unsure of this and there is a risk of serious illness, we should take exclusionary measures.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was unquestionably established that the disease was also transmitted through blood.
This case convinced us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999, a technique was introduced that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV, the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can detect the virus directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies to the virus that previously used tests were based on.
Using the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period from infection to detection of the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be shortened to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk of blood donors unknowingly contaminating the bloodstream and preventing it from being detected.
These advances have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million a person.
"In other words, we should be allocating 12 million blood products while someone is infected with HIV.
Since HEMA-Québec distributes 400 to 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that anyone today can readily accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health", says the head of the Hema-Québec.
"The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen will enter the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is introduced into the bloodstream through insect bites.
We must therefore be constantly on the loose", continued Dr. Décary, and stressed that in addition to the stocks of pesticides, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent stocks.
"As the population ages, so do the demands.
As cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or blood platelets to be replaced.
The ageing population also affects the blood donor population, with the number of people eligible to donate blood in the network representing only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, any healthy person who is at least 18 years old and who meets the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of the respondents refuse blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is rampant are not eligible for blood transfusions for a year.
"We have enough reserves with that 3 percent to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's rare to run out of supplies.
But we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the people who are present get older because after a while they can no longer give blood.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's rushed world, a person has barely an hour to go and donate blood". - Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues such as bone grafts, heart valves, eye tissue and skin tissue, which are almost exclusively used for severely burned persons.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages Québec's only public stem cell bank.
Now, only medical waste can be used to produce blood that is rich in stem cells and can treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the first blood sample of the baby's blood a few weeks ago, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
By the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering these for organ transplants", explained Dr. Décary, who said that the cord blood transfusion program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are saddened that they cannot afford this", - indeed, because Héma-Québec cannot afford to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Québec.
Football - The Impact in the play-offs
The Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounders 3-1 in the USL-1 playoffs yesterday, and advanced to the quarterfinals with a combined score of 4:3.
The decisive goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute.
While the first half went without a goal, in the second half the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found their opponent's net.
Roger Levesque is the only one from the Sounders to have managed to knock Matt Jordan out of the gate.
Let's recall that in Friday's first game, Impact suffered a 2-1 loss to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact is playing the Vancouver Whitecaps in the playoffs.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who beat the Whitecaps 3-1 in the first game, 4-3, but the Whitecaps advanced to the quarterfinals with a combined score of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the games will be released later this day.
In the match, Kovalev scored the winning goal.
The Canadiens' favorite trio is preparing for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great strikes and finally the Canadiens won 3-2 on penalties against the Florida Panthers last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the top scorer of the match, scored one goal, Plekanec two and Kovalev one goal, which was the team's fourth victory of six pre-season games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the match.
"I'm not ready yet", warns the Russian player.
"I need one more game to feel really fit".
"He tried too hard in the first third", notes Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy about the outcome of the game.
She got a huge ovation".
The Northern Purposes of Charest
The governor does not rule out that the election will begin this year
Just after the Liberal Party meeting, Jean Charest travelled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is seeking victory in the midterm elections to be held today.
"Straightening our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charès at the Liberal Party meeting in Levis, Quebec yesterday.
During his performance, behind his back, he was projected a film similar to "Moulin à images".
The three giant launchers were followed by impressive footage: damages for hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular devices are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his timetable was very tight.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's 'vision' for the future of Quebec, embodied in a 'new economic zone', which includes a labour agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement and several agreements with Ontario.
Recently, the opening of the North (i.e. the northern region starting at 49°N) has been a frequent theme in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
However, the Head of State only insisted on explaining why he considers the North to be "a treasure trove of immense potential", but did not mention the time factor, the amount of investment or the precise order of importance for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities, notably in the water power sector, the forestry sector and in particular in the mining sector, which is further stimulated by the growth of the developing countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
"Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds" are found in the north, Charest wrote.
This territory, which is "twice the size of France", "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, it is in us", the head of state repeated, stressing that he wants to create a national founding myth.
He stressed that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Quebec design work, James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a stage break and gazing at the giant map behind his back.
The north, which covers 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded of itself, the Prime Minister told a press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and if the opportunity arises I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government.'
On the other hand, "in the face of climate change, we must rethink our view of the North", the Prime Minister said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which opens every year as the polar ice melts.
The Prime Minister believes that in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister stated that the Government of Quebec paid special attention to them and that the plan would bring many benefits, especially to young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate of the Parti Québécois) have already started the consultation with about thirty local communities.
It was also launched by an inter-ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where "they create a common vision".
The development of the North would, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematic and environmentally friendly", the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime minister who preceded him.
"Like the liberals of the past, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development through challenges".
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with a large cocktail party on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as president.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes the conversion of the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout canal.
"Our Party's politicians, including Godbout, founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who led the quiet revolution and the nationwide distribution of hydroelectric power plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another true, conservative work, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program from 1957 to 1963.
In connection with the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam project, Chairman Charest stressed that the commissioning was planned for 2012.
"This should stay between us, but I plan to be there", he told his followers, and his statement was greeted with a loud applause.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out a vote this fall, which the law allows.
However, he stressed that the calendar is now full, having taken on duties at the Federal Council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party's weekend meeting proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal president to articulate nationalist resolutions, which were passed almost without thinking.
I also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council, and those members have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, however, has been skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-examined the development policy in northern Quebec that was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
Marois said the liberal government that came to power in 2003 had refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would have gone much further today", Mrs Marois thought, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was launched as a candidate in the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"But we wish it wasn't just a game", noted Sébastien Proulx, the party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from prison today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, the Harper Cabinet Minister (pronounced "Justice") took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt Canada's "shame".
To insult a woman who has fought tirelessly for the truth and deserves all our admiration reveals a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which is the only Western country that hasn't sent its own citizens home from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is a government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of committing.
It's the only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, has refused to give its word and let a child soldier languish in inhuman conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet show of justice while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let's just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding Omar Khadr's return to Canada for a fair trial.
Our government is blind to torture, it doesn't care that a young adult has been spiritually destroyed and that years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently undergoing the subtle destruction of our rights, our freedom and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper is constantly saying this word, which sounds like a mere empty word in his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the pleasure of a government leader who has been a minority until now (and what can come after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies the virtue, the law and order, and they don't see that this government is trampling on the values that our country has been blessed with its good reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, this is the shame of it.
Opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
A letter was published in the September 17 issue of Le Devoir from Patrick J. Garver, vice president and general manager of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
Following Orwell's impeachment, Garver claims that the world's largest gold producer has filed a $6 million libel suit against three authors and a small-scale publisher to launch a so-called "public debate".
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions - especially in libel cases - are based on the law rather than on justice.
No wonder Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate is to destroy anyone who has a contrary view?
Regardless of the outcome of the case, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend significant sums of money on defence and combat in an uneven struggle where the mining industry is supported by an army of lawyers with almost inexhaustible resources.
In such unequal combat, however, tactics are often employed to destroy the defendant and to make a friendly settlement, not only silencing the opponents but even intimidating those who would try to re-examine the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have been more about public opinion.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is different, in Canada the parties to the dispute do not usually slap each other but express their views.
So the mine would have just opened its books and files and prepared for a real debate in the press, the media, the publications, paying independent research groups to shed light on the issue.
But it seems Barrick Gold is not trusting the public and is moving to dismiss petitions and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Mr. Garver, could you please explain how to initiate a "public" debate while at the same time ignoring this public opinion?
In the Vice President's mind, the word probably refers to only lawyers who are paid by bus, not the Canadian population as a whole.
In a democratic state, even those who despise others are allowed free speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because they condemn the mining's harsh practices.
The public is willing to hear Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments rather than a lawsuit intended to silence many. (In a recent letter to the authors of Noir Canada, Barrick Gold has, by the way, called for the use of the term "public debate".)
In addition to Garver's surreal overtones, Barrick Gold's process is an open attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, the cornerstones of every democratic society.
In the course of the proceedings, he denies the right to quote credible sources, to debate anything about the facts and their interpretations that underlie the intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss issues that are not pleasing to the rich corporations of today's world under the weight of legal proceedings, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have a right to answer.
We have long been able to handle debates, differences and conflicts in our academic circles.
Barrick Gold's reckless course of action shows that contrary to what he claims, there is no willingness to openly debate.
This is a loss to both the university world and the Canadian Institute of Public Disputes, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit legal proceedings against such abuse.
Wall Street rescue - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress finally agreed yesterday on an economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to default; the right to access the salaries of the managers of the companies that received the aid.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, a Republican delegate to the hearing yesterday, announced the good news minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon hearing ended.
"We have made great progress toward a solution that will work effectively in the markets", said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
"We did everything to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be a huge amount of shock, chaos and chaos in the everyday lives of Americans", said Republican Rep. Judd Gregg.
The trial has been accelerated over the past few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investors' mood.
The deal was given a deadline until the stock market opened this morning.
Two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late appeared willing to agree, but they expressed their displeasure that the situation had escalated to the final.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the extension of the agreement to provisions such as keeping house ownership or paying the heads of state-aided companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps for the irresponsibility of others, it is not a very pleasant thing.
But these steps are necessary", he noted on an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so".
"What I have read in great detail shows that this is something we all have to digest and move on.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan was to use taxpayer money to buy the dubious claims of American financial institutions, risky, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the housing bubble, which led to the collapse of risky mortgages, then spread to other credit-based (commercial) securities, and finally to the freezing of liquid assets and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft of the agreement was defeated by a group of Republican lawmakers last week.
It seems we've been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of troubled companies should be insured by the government rather than bought.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan included a provision that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would be paid first; an additional $100 billion could follow if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress by a vote of no confidence.
In exchange for the help, Washington will get a stake in the subsidiaries, which will give him a dividend on the profits, and which he can sell after the crisis subsides.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the foreclosure of the mortgage loans covered by the plan and to set the maximum amount of wages and final payments to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan makers want the bill to be approved by the House of Representatives today and the Senate Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still unsure whether the plan will be approved.
Because yesterday, there were repeated statements against the plan from both the Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice", said House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett, a Republican.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is none that would benefit taxpayers".
Brad Sherman, the Democratic congressman who leads a small group called the "sceptical faction", presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, have written to us asking Congress not to rush and to consider carefully which path to take", Sherman said yesterday.
Europe was once again aware of the global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize a part of the Fortis banking group worth EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French BNP Paribas announced that it would not acquire its bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 million (US$ 2,9 billion) in the US secondary mortgage crisis.
Fortis, with 85,000 employees, is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
"This is not a waste of money", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government appears to be nationalising another bank that has been hit hard by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the entire ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley Bank, which includes 41 billion pounds ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the British bank's subsidiaries and client assets.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actors' Room
Some say that the beautiful blue eyes were his main card, others say that it was his main weakness.
Has the charming American actor ever been rid of a narcissistic mirror?
Yeah, and no.
His shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent also kept him away from the noisy style that is the very existence of the great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge race he's been on.
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at his Connecticut estate, one of the last icons of the American cinema boom.
He was less monumental than Brando, who he looked like and who had long been a rival in the film business, more restrained in his ways and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The blood mix often produces extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merit.
He was a self-made man and a pacific war fighter, and he went to Yale in the early 1950s, then to the Actors Studio in New York before he was drawn to theater, television, and soon after to film.
In addition to being a civil rights activist, he was runner-up in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and was regarded as a sex symbol, even though he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know what shadows were in the life of this mysterious, secluded, dedicated actor who hated the glitz of show business.
He was a man of integrity in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the weekend shocked movie fans: his big roles are now only visible on the black screen of memories.
His life's work is a testament to the seventh American art movement, which has been continuously evolving for over fifty years.
Our memories are intertwined with the charming 1969 cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and the chilling young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who was seen in the 1958 Tennessee Williams production of "Cat in the Hot Tub".
Recently, in 1990, we can recall the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age and his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
We've seen a lot of other faces of Paul Newman in his movies.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Upstairs", he played the unforgettable role of the violent life-crime boxer Rocky Graziano, a role originally intended for James Deann - and taken over after his death - that launched Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant play "The Great Trouble", which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
He played a bitter, vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's brilliant film The Swindler (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, for which he received his only Academy Award nomination in 1987.
Times change, but it's always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
His career was marked by the change of the ages.
Younger is best known for his 1977 cult film "Icebreakers" by George Roy Hill, in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an ice hockey team who works in unconventional methods.
His fans were able to see him in "The Big Leap" recorded by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The series ended in 2003 with Sam Mendes' film "The Road to Perdition", where he was last seen as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many film legends who left the film industry relatively early, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood for its glitter, glamour and hypocrisy.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered the film "a living reflection of humiliation" because of its overly powerful play.
However, the profession was not always kind to handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time was simply obsessed with film roles.
Rarely, however, did he play young and successful characters, but rather figures living on the margins of society - nervous, alcoholic, malicious, or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he could replicate with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: deep down, a truly self-absorbed and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (which is an adaptation of the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), he and his wife, Joanne Woodward, portrayed a melancholy woman in the title role.
In 1984, he made a film that reflected restraint and sadness, "Harry and his Son", in memory of his son, Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's many admirers remembered the actor, and his close friend and longtime combat partner, Robert Redford (who he played with in The Great Trouble and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), said in a sad tone, "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of this great actor's vibrant personality, which we just lost.
His legendary career is overshadowed by his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and his comments against Hollywood's scandals.
We've seen her smile many times on the packaging of sausages, cookies and other foods, and she's been doing it with a pretty bad mouth, even though she thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to the Foundation for Children with Disabilities.
Newman never sat down in his beers, he was committed to his profession the whole time.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following: "Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for the lucky star.
It was a privilege to be here".
We too are privileged to have been able to accompany such a brilliant and generous American artist throughout his career.
He was a citizen, after all.
What did they produce at Zuschlag & Tsai accounting?
Soon, on October 8, the criminal trial of John Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are charged with fraud and other offences, including forgery of documents, which are particularly damaging and are committed in a continuous and business-like manner in a criminal organisation.
The prosecutor's office said that the tender money won was used for its own purposes and that the tasks were often verified by false invoices.
State and local government funds - a total of about HUF 65 million - went partly to the Youth Left's cashier and partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method described by the Authority was that the tender money won was collected on the basis of cost accounts which had no real performance and the associations never fulfilled the undertaking.
The indictment says most of the accounts were fake.
The stamps were obtained from the market in Johannesburg and the stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And to which companies the accounting was to be made, including the Balaton-Rural Circuit, to which Zuschlag John sent István Lados.
The latter's testimony says he had to look at boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption, which was then used to prepare invoices for applications from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Labour Office and the Metropolitan Municipality.
Most of these were recorded by Lados István and his colleague, Guardi András, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports to obtain the grants.
One of Lados's "training routes" was a church.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlagek in 2003, the inn provided food for a group of 90 people of the Secure Point Association.
However, according to the manager, they would not have been able to enter the inn at the same time.
Similarly, the Bill for a Better Future, later known as Together for the Third Millennium, issued in the summer of 2002 was plagued by errors in form and content.
A guesthouse in Bacon County had only three rooms, and more than 10 people could not sleep in it for one night, yet the bill was for 130 guests.
But the fanciful applicants were overwhelmed when they nominated Pigal Kft., also a hospitality company, whose books, according to the prosecutor's office, did not include the documents for Better Future and Hope.
The company's manager, Wolf Winner, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown the bills, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The label misplaced our business name and tax number".
He added that for formal reasons, the fact that 100 people were displaced was also not correct, since they have 11 rooms in total that do not have enough room for husbands.
And the bill was for catering, even though their restaurant has been closed for a long time.
The enthusiastic accountants also failed to take into account that the Budapest travel agency they were looking at only organised foreign travel, so they designated disruptive travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not conform to the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, the document also included the alphabet, although travel to countries outside the European Union was off-limits.
The amount of VAT was also found to be in error in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Better Future, since the company's services were not provided by the 25% VAT rate indicated, but by the 15% VAT rate, and the hotel's employees only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the 'exhibitors' have also failed to account for the fact that, in the case of a company, they have designated road freight as an activity carried out, as was established by the prosecution, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal differences - not the correct account format, not the actual stamp - it was found that the accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Secure Point were fake.
As with Ravenna Bt. or Kunvehringen Sport Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued the bills.
The counterfeiters also failed to take note of the fact that HIB Kft. in the archives was being liquidated at the time (2001) when the Young City Association group ate there, and the company's liquidation officer, to our knowledge, denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously stated
The second group of account issuers is those who were aware that they had to issue a fake account.
The Budapest Opportunity Foundation, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, issued a bill for the Third Millennium Foundation together, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Ltd. was, according to the indictment, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, who ordered the issuance of the fake account.
It also cooperated with Zuschlagek, Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Mines Association in 2003 with accounts valued at roughly HUF 5 million, without any real economic activity.
No movement of funds, because the bills were then stolen, but the organizations forgot to include it in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the bill is those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery agent for the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and automotive business headquartered in Budapest, although not located there, was Ivan Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment in October, November and December 2005 worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalasi, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The company was run by a Romanian man, who was also reported to have been sent documents relating to the company by Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
We know Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the firm to Atlas, Hoppa and the Joint Third Millennium Foundation, and he recorded their counter value.
In particular, at the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian stoneworkers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually operated, which the defendant said was because they were not getting jobs.
The companies benefited, however, because, at the request of his partner defendant, lawyer Saint Zsolt, who also produced the company documents, he issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlag-related associations Atlas and Y-Generation.
In total, Kubatov provided 15 accounts to the organisations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the accounts and the stake hit the Kubatov mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to display fake bills, which were produced for the Safe Point bid.
Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a tender in January 2006 to the Dancsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), the socialist party's public benefit organisation.
They won 500 to 500 thousand forints, but the money was not used for the purposes stated in the tender.
To keep this from happening, five fake bills received from Works Team Kft. were filed with TMA.
These bills were found during a search of the house of Kemecsei Árpád's office near his educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, like the prosecution, are likely reporting on the accounting process.
Perhaps most interesting is that you are the prime defendant, John Zuschlag, who decides to appeal the verdict.
His testimony so far has not been very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak in full, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in his best interest, even though the socialists have made a deal with him to pay back the greater part of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi will take the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, because his requests to ease his conditions of detention, that is, to house arrest, have been constantly deafening.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause far greater harm and do not compensate can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he has no option.
The psychology of over-crowding: Why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuroeconomic basis for this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been uncovered by researchers at New York University, neurologists and economists.
According to their study in the journal Science, people do not want to lose out in a type of competition, such as eBay auctions, and they are willing to pay too high a price.
The research attempted to map the neural system of this "play" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took part in a lottery, the other group participated in a game auction, while the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examined the active brain areas of the subjects.
Both games allowed participants to earn money, but in the auction game, where the other party's over-engagement was a key element, a sub-brain complex called the striatum became active when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, among other functions, plays a role in the "rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, the researchers believe that the price shock can be explained by the avoidance of the intense reaction of striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group, economists, also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this case, three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they won the game, they would receive another $15 in prize money.
The third group received $15 just before the auction, but the group members lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
The only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on winning for one group and losing for the other.
However, proving the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the "loss" team were willing to bet higher than the control and the "power" group.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previous economic theory.
They have thus far explained the phenomena of auctioning only by the joy of winning and by avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, and now we have a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the economics department at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and chronic liver disease is listed as the leading cause of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis at home can be in the hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name for infectious liver infections caused by various viruses.
They have many similarities, characterized by inflammation and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms, depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the feeding ducts (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (feces, bladder, saliva).
Travelers should be protected against A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after eating infected food, generally accompanied by poor mood, weakness, stomach complaints, nausea.
Afterward, yellowing appears on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing process can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, one million people die each year of the more serious form of the disease, liver and liver disease caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that only one in ten infected people is estimated to receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver failure, liver cancer.
Most infected people are unaware of their disease because the pathogen secretly destroys liver cells, often not showing symptoms until 20 to 30 years later.
So it's very important to have early prevention, regular screening.
There were three groups with far higher than average incidence: people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people worldwide infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, it is advisable to consult a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
If the disease is detected in time, it can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, eliminating infectiousness and preventing cancer.
World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world, is celebrated on September 30.
It aims to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection.
Does anyone who believes in God feel any less pain?
A recent study has shown that religious faith acts as a kind of pain reliever that could have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how belief in God influences people's perceptions of pain, reports The Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and the same number of atheists were electrocuted while they were all studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to human brain dissection techniques, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brain that controls pain.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics, scientists, philosophers, and theologians from across the university.
The study was conducted precisely by attaching a spark device to the left hand of the subject to provide the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look closely at two paintings, the 17th-century painting of the Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century painting of Leonardo da Vinci by Lady Hermeline.
The study's authors hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would evoke a religious state among the faithful, while the da Vinci painting was chosen because it was not too different from others and thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while viewing a religious or general image.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" as they "cared about" and "calmed down and were filled with peace" when they saw the Virgin Mary.
They reported 12 percent less pain when viewing a religious-themed picture than when they saw Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was also involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong-impact image, even in atheists, only by finding the right photo.
"We should find a picture of someone who feels very positive about you, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
"Faith should be practiced and in many cases it changes our personality", Wright added.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similarly calibrated painter showed a picture of a madonna to the faithful, what effect would that have on their pain control?
Would a quality vision of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share about yourself
On your 10th birthday, Google can tell you that you can find it in people's pockets at least as much as you can find it in the sky above their heads; you know where they've been on vacation, what specialties they're attending and what interests them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top executives.
But for the skeptics who have the Orwellian horror, they don't see the very essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's primary goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and that's necessary to keep up with the original goal of the founders of Google, which sounded like "getting all the information in the world".
The spokesman for Google said that after 10 years of global work, the company is still in the early stages of managing all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like, "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would really fit me?" - but until now, software can't answer these seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms are recorded exactly when they are searching, from which IP address they are searching and which page they are going to after the search.
For example, with Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can store their own browsing background, re-check what they're looking for, what they've clicked on, and this will generate much more personalized finds for them in the long run - the same logic that recommends that the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at what I do? - users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the potential power of the company can be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom, or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only recorded but can also be passed on to third parties where appropriate, and in such legal cases the privacy rights of internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the most famous example of this in recent times was a coordinated campaign against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identifiable information about pedophiles from its social network, Orkut, which it operates.
But privacy-conscious Internet users could have fled in May, when the company successfully defended itself in court against the FBI with the help of the electronic law enforcement agency EFF, which said Google could not be forced by any constitutional clause to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(However, the federal government has successfully fought to obtain some 50,000 websites and 1,000 search terms, which it won by citing the reaffirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but has yet to obtain individual users' search lists or a complete two-month list of websites and keywords.)
So Google's judgment is quite controversial: it's being scolded by those who fear giving their personal data because they feel their privacy and privacy are being compromised by the fact that they're starting to use Google's services and are going to revolt against them by the conservative-imaginary multinationals.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild drive to cram into many countries of passionate computer fans, activists, users sees the next generation of big companies, the "great corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which has emerged as the world champion because of Windows, no matter how hard they both fight for the same goal.
This is because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for an ID code, does not ask for money for its applications, and open source software and software packages that are free, constantly updated, are much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software theory practices.
But it can also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy and the Internet, which is one of the most talked about keywords of recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about knowingly leaving traces behind and using the communication channels we have, and while the scale varies from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
The average teenager can create profiles on multiple social networks from Facebook to Shangri-La, link them to other services like Twitter or last.fm, which lists his musical habits, then link them all to tracking systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also run a blog that automatically shows up his latest photo galleries, which are stored on Flickr or Picas.
While there are many exemplary examples that illustrate this, a girlfriend can easily find out from the morning photo feed of a group of friends who spent the night with a cheating friend or can fire a company employee just because she shares her honest opinion on top management on her blog: a confident, private life concept that has been completely reevaluated by now.
The online life is what you show yourself, and that's the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And if you want to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, you can do it (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google's search engine but doesn't intentionally leave a trace).
For example, there are a lot of people who don't register on social media to avoid being caught, and Google's online apps, from text editors to image managers to news readers, can be replaced with alternatives that don't connect to huge server parks and don't build the best profile we've ever had.
The public isn't so secretive about Google showing off tooth protein.
With its current value of $156 billion, which is more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising interfaces threaten advertising agency revenue, and the rapidly expanding services it is introducing are causing severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, find disturbing counter-arguments: for example, top management completely rejected employees' protests after doubling the cost of corporate daycare, found it too expensive to feed employees at will several times a day, but all this is reflected in the fact that Google had already turned its head to the Chinese government in 2006 and, by agreement, the company would eliminate any findings that would violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they don't announce a new service in advance unless it's already available, but the problems that may be present in the months and years ahead will surely move the world to another point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project has reached such a size that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others fear the Health system, because we can build a complete health profile with our previous records, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could provide a good foundation for the next generation of science fiction writers, and Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled, describes a future where a person can only be approached with a very precise approach from Google data.
Two teenagers helped the former double murderer in the fingerprinting demonstration
Two teenagers were questioned by police in the case of the former double murder, allegedly helping to dispose of evidence of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Department said Tuesday.
The young men have admitted to committing a crime and are currently being charged with criminal misconduct.
The two teenagers, two girls, according to MTI, are on parole.
The offence is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.
The suspect in the Odessa double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was placed under preliminary arrest on Sunday.
Predeterminedly, out of a desire for profit, he's being charged with the crime of killing several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed more money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect refused to settle his debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an old place, where he killed him and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, and the evidence suggests that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon.
The police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the weapon and its use with the help of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to acquire the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - some 5 billion Czech crowns - to buy the 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded from the Czech market by the Prague Stock Exchange as a potential new owner.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the paperwork within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 has recently learned that the Polish offer represents the highest amount ever offered by interested parties on the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted tenders.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, stated last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among the interested parties and did not exclude that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by market experts at 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders' agreement, about 90% of the papers could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a stake of around 25%, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the worsening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already referring to "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president, accuses La Repubblica in Rome, who has not even been able to put his own party behind a wounded bill designed to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it's more appropriate to talk about the second 9/11 attack.
A section of the Madrid press is seeing the criminal in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of the American financial system collapsing is growing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the congressional vote, the danger is that Washington will not offer a political tool to handle the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still provide relief to the backward financial institutions and use taxpayer money to save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor the new impulses will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national selfishness and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, weaker financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, says Vienna's Der Standard, which says that the growing concern that European taxpayers, like Americans, must go deep into their pockets to fix the crisis is real.
The EU has not taken seriously the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'savers' do not have to raise a hundred billion euros immediately, but it would be good to set out: in which case it is reasonable to tap into taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The flight of the dongos is imitated by the intelligent car
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than to mimic obstacle detectors in the natural world?
Like the bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the dongos gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type, bio-modulated robotic control system, a robotic minivan equipped with bee traits, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that avoids all collisions.
During flight, each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety coat", explained Kazuhhiro Doi, brand manager of technology PR and R&D at the exhibition.
It is important for the complex eye of the bee, which can see in more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To simulate the complex function of the eye, engineers developed the idea of a laser telescope.
This detects obstacles, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance operation, within a distance of 2 metres from the BR23C at 180 degrees.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and the robot immediately changes direction by imitating the movements of the uterus, turning the wheels around to avoid the collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoiding maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If that wasn't the case, the car robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It shall react promptly and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety-belt cover, a layer within which collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to get rid of other bees.
This process should happen in a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the difference cannot be upward, downward or transverse, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of the reversal of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility for bees to avoid other bees, only rotational motion and acceleration and slowing down were used as the option for the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy densities, meaning they have a longer lifetime than the lithium-ion variant.
Andoh says instinctive intelligence is the most important thing, not the ability to process data, but even less to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
You don't have to save them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so you're only using a few dozen kilobytes of memory all the time.
You don't need gigabytes or megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate-output technology that Nissan estimates could be introduced into series production cars within 10 years.
Further application may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the vehicle to the destination by avoiding road obstacles.
It's also been called the Poison Dragon Kid.
The written version of the multi-part legislation is ready to be implemented, the $700 billion economic bailout package to buy off bad loans from banks.
Half the money is spent in the first round.
In a new round of talks lasting until midnight on Saturday, Eastern Time, congressional leaders have come to the brink of days of debate over a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
We've made serious progress", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said the deal was just a paperwork effort.
The compromise package was endorsed by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program would work and be effective, but that more work was needed, and Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about reversing the economic cycle.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets at 8pm on Sunday evening (i.e. 2am on Monday Central European Time) on Washington time, but did not cause a dramatic surge in the stock market.
The draft legislation on the programme, known as the Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act 2008, will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, by the way, differs from the Bush administration's original proposal that $700 billion would be spent on the same low-quality, credit-impaired securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent with $250 billion immediately used after Congress votes on the matter, which is expected to be Monday, when the Treasury buys credit-based, low-grade securities, and the fate of the next $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
The program will be overseen by a separate board, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion is subject to a new congressional resolution.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: simultaneously buying bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly, the ministry officials said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets of concern for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system for up to $700 billion, whether it's buying bad assets on a large scale, insuring them, or avoiding the systemic risk of a major financial institution collapsing.
We're taking the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it's signed, he added.
But bank executives in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect the government to restrict their withdrawal funds - which the overseas slang simply calls a gold shelf.
Payments are limited only in certain cases and the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if you buy at auction, the Ministry will levy an additional tax on the gold deposit unless you retire to the levyed bank manager.
When you buy bad loans directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that management funds are not overused.
The picture is that the existing gold umbrella contracts will not change, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal restriction on the compensation of CEOs will be in place", said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the participating banks, the State gains the right to acquire a stake, reducing the risk to taxpayers, as they can ultimately profit from the transaction as the economy and the rescued bank recover.
The bill provides that the President must submit a motion to Congress within the next five years to determine how taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
There were people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That's not what the American people have asked us to do, which is not protect taxpayer dollars", said Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were being pushed by the same people responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9% in August 2007 - KSH reports.
Industrial export sales prices were 1,1% higher than in July 2008, down 3,9% from a year earlier.
As a result of the changes in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0,7% higher than in the previous year and 3,2% higher than a year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum of 0.1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0,1% compared to July.
The largest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2,8%) mainly due to monthly price increases in baggage and footwear manufacturing of 4,6% and footwear manufacturing of 2,5%.
The higher prices of plastics and chemicals have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
The price decline was observed in the oil processing sector (1.4%), electrical machinery and instrument manufacturing (0.9%) and, to a minimum extent, wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing remained the same.
In the other processing industries, we saw a 0.2% to 0.9% increase in prices.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sector, which has a significant share of the industry's domestic sales, prices increased by 0,3% in August, mainly as a result of the retracing effect of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison, the oil processing sector saw the largest increase in prices (32,4%) in terms of domestic sales of the processing industries.
The production of metalworking products in the sector saw a price increase of 13,2% and the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which represent the main weight, of 11%.
The decrease in prices occurred in the textile and textile manufacturing sectors (2,5%) and in the electrical machinery and instrument manufacturing sectors (0,3%).
The other processing industries were subject to a price increase of between 0,6% and 9,1%.
Overall, the manufacturing industry has seen prices rise by 10.2% over the past year.
The electricity, gas, steam and water sector prices were 18.7% higher than a year earlier.
The highest monthly price increase in domestic sales of the target groups of sectors in August was in the sectors producing investment goods (0,7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0,3% and in the energy and recycling sectors, prices remained unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase was observed in the energy and recycling sectors (16,8%) compared to the same month of the previous year.
We saw a 6.8% increase in prices in the consumer goods sector and a 1.4% decrease in prices in the investment goods sector.
The export sales prices of the industry, measured in forints, increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month, decreasing by 3,9% in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened 1.7 percent against the euro, 7.1 percent against the dollar, and strengthened 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar in August 2007.
Next year, you won't need a visa to the United States?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will come into effect around January 12th, the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before local Hungarian leaders.
According to him, "now everything depends on the timely deployment of electronic access and control systems overseas".
He also pointed out that the new system will not allow entry, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be presented with the Star by the Hungarian Republic's Central Cross of Merit, and hold talks with Democratic Party foreign policy advisers Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee John McCain.
The bank savings package is backed by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major American party presidential candidates, both secured support for the government's $700 billion bank bailout package on Sunday, but there is a politician who is demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon negotiations, Congress and the administration announced early Sunday that they had reached a settlement on the bank's bailout package.
The financial package to dissolve the frozen credit market and the Wall Street crisis has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are both proving themselves more capable than their rivals of leading the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, putting economic issues first has again given Obama some advantage, a melted McCain advantage that he gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama at a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday expressed hope that the $700 billion package would be passed by Congress quickly.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passports which he also supported.
"We must act now, responsibly . . . with a threat to your jobs, your savings, the stability of entire industries, the stability of the entire economy", he told the crowd of 35,000.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to have a hard time swallowing this . . . but doing nothing is simply not the way".
The Republican senator said the proposal included setting up a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the final payments to top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no significant role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill by Monday.
The German-speaking area is a very old-fashioned
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp voters have become more self-aware, Der Spiegel analyzes the CSU's weakness in Bavaria.
They're ready to govern Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents, he analyses the causes of CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades, and now it's these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday, a process that was almost exactly ten years ago likely ended: the unquestioned hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below 50 percent for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was still the time of Stoiber.
That's because CSU is consistently modernizing the province, eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they've been very wrong about the pace, but there could be no consequences without the voters' loyalty to CSU, secularization, educational outcomes, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by increased opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also evident.
The right wing camp is intact, only inside the camp, the voters have become more self-aware, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also striking that in recent weeks the classical civil society groups have moved away from CSU the most; freelancers, industrialists, graduates and higher education.
CSU's support has already dropped below 40 percent.
The following is a list of the official languages of the European Union.
The conservative Vienna daily, "Who, with whom? Party leaders on the backed-up coalition issues", discusses the turbulent domestic political situation that followed the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the OVP.
The EPP prohibits the SPO from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BSO is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens are not yet willing to negotiate the coalition.
The election is over, everything is now revolving around the coalition; in a debate on public service television, the party leaders barely allowed access to their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann has confirmed his intention to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current President of the ÖVP as Vice-Chancellor - was left open to Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
There's no point in repeating this.
Molterer was cautious about the red offers.
As you said, if Faymann attempts to interfere with the internal affairs of the PVO, then the cooperation will be fruitless.
Whether you choose the opposition or join the coalition, which is currently open to the party, the issues must be discussed within the OPC.
President Jörg Haider has repeatedly shown himself open to all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility", said Haider.
The Road: Breaking the Devil's Circle of Poverty and Segregation
The European Summit on Equality of Opportunities, which this year will be hosted by France, has begun in Paris.
In her message to the plenary as one of the key speakers of the professional consultation, Jároka Lívia, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, called attention to education segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
The consultation was attended by representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equality.
Járóka, according to the press release of the Fidesz EP delegation, warned that apart from discrimination in employment, Roma are primarily forced out of the labour market because of their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have a secondary education and, due to poor basic education, only a small percentage of them can obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
The representative said that it was necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest possible context, including among Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier Roma students start school, the more likely they are to become productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
'The right of Roma to quality education must be guaranteed by their EU citizenship and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education must be guaranteed', Jaroca Livia stressed.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of children with disabilities (OJ L 347, 30.10.2008, p.
"The diabolical cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities given them by the democratic space to contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe", Jaroca demanded.
The European Equality Summit, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting to mark the 'European Year of Equality for All', aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination set out at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for the time being
At the end of October, the fate of the disbanded Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided.
Despite the dismal election defeat, the heads are still standing, and the top of the Bavarian CSU have so far been busy discussing personal issues.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and provincial governor Günther Beckstein may still hold office, but the question is, how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, which suffers a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-reviewed couple have, in any case, noticed that they don't cling to their chairs with all their might.
This was to try to calm the angry members of the faction and base who demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bajor tsunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent of its strength, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only gained 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, CSU was a "monopoly" in Bavaria, which contributed 18% of German GDP.
While the Conservatives continue to count on a high level of support in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will certainly be forced to coalite in the future.
One of the first signs of a change in the party is that Horst Seehofer, vice president and federal agriculture minister, who is Huber's possible successor, is also joining the narrow scouting team that is beginning negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters on a possible coalition government in Munich.
The curious twist of fate is that the list of Free Voters is being drafted by Gabriele Pauli, who used his stance against Stoiber as a coup d'etat by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then mercilessly treated the ambitious local government politician.
CSU leaders are now putting all their energy into trying to stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been playing a role in the transition, called September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
Huber made some stern comments to the CDU on Monday, thinking they should have received much more support from the siblings.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is somehow restored by a common force.
Merkel, who has been frustrated by the failure, said the CSU's failure will not adversely affect the Berlin coalition.
Relative, of course: the injured CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
The following table shows the results of the tests:
Not a single opposition member of the Belarusian parliament entered the election on Sunday.
Russian observers say this can be explained by the prosperity and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing the opposition for a decade, ahead of yesterday's elections the United Democratic Forces (UDF) coalition strongly hoped that the constitutional amendment would "allow" some opposition members to appear in parliament this time, after Lukasenko renewed his presidential mandate for a fourth time in the disputed 2006 election.
The ODSZ has thus withdrawn from the previously considered boycott.
The opposition's expectations were that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has taken credit for reducing Russia's steadily increasingly expensive natural gas imports and has also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines through the country, to Russia - wanted to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are denied entry permits due to the anti-democratic political arrangements in Belarus.
He pointed out in advance that it was a relief that the OSCE focused on positive moves in its election campaign evaluations rather than shortcomings - such as the banning of a third of the opposition candidates from running.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday already condemned the campaign - in which opposition candidates were virtually barred from appearing in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
The opposition says there is a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, despite the fact that Russia - which makes Belarus a paper federal state - has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkevics told our newspaper.
The 2006 presidential candidate said it was desirable that this should continue, despite the fact that "the government was afraid to allow even one opposition to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning to protest the results, but is trying to convey the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, local authorities are putting obstacles to their distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly", Milinkevics said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which sees the creation of social security as its main achievement, does not even consider it appropriate for the most officially supported pensioners.
- The country's debt, the growing trade deficit, the decline of social security, which "calls for the silence of the grave", was a matter of time, Milinkevics thought.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have described the election as democratic.
Sergey Lebegyev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotating doors were used in a unique way to allow workers to enter and exit.
From today, this new measure will be effective against the whistleblowers, the screening of those who block and then go out for a coffee during business hours.
The anti-diploma news was unveiled today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's Office's Secretary General.
"The turn-off", said Brunetta, "is for better and more efficient work, reducing shortcomings and increasing services".
"A new, more responsible and transparent period is coming.
This is the real reform", Brunetta stressed.
The Chigi Palace is completing the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of the rotary gate is also symbolic".
The employee's resistance was not felt, the Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated".
In a word, breakfast is over during work hours, no more coffee and beans.
Brunetta smiles and advises, "A good little cappuccino at seven in the morning, capable of miracles".
At the College of Administration in Rome
At a meeting held in Brussels, the minister explained that "in three months, the shortage of sickness workers in the public sector has decreased by 50%, which means that in one year, 60,000 more people are going to work".
He also stressed that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
"which, according to the minister, has had wage dynamics twice as high as those of the private sector in the last eight to 10 years and has well exceeded inflation rates".
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered to join a petition supported by the Italian Environmental and Consumer Protection Association to protest the Brunetta regulations.
"While the minister of public administration boasts of evidence supporting the reduction of deficits due to the disease, the 'untiring diary' epidemic continues to grow", writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hardworking civil servants throughout Italy gathered to wage war against the illegal provisions of the regulation".
The Regional Administrative Court has been challenging, inter alia, the abolition of supplementary sickness benefits for reasons of service, the extension of the period of stay of sick leave for workers at home, which is the period during which the visitor can appear, and several other aspects of the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
In Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur every day, of which three are fatal and 27 result in permanent disability.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, there were nearly 1,200 deaths at work in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, claiming nearly twice the number of victims as murder.
Today, Anmil is celebrating the 58th anniversary of the Day of Victims of Workplace Accidents in every county of Italy, traditionally on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communications to this dramatic problem.
"The alarming data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, support the fact that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work", said Giorgio Napolitano in a message to President Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workplace Accidents Rocketry.
The head of state sincerely praised the "unity's continued commitment to workplace prevention, protecting the interests of workers who have been injured, helping victims' families and making public opinion receptive".
"It is natural and openly shared outrage to see such tragedies, of their size and of interest to the media and the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic, day after day, recurring events".
Napolitano admits openly: "We are certainly facing a lack of resources and funding education and information is crucial.
School-based initiatives aimed at directing young people on the verge of entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to let attention be diverted to the social importance of the issue, and more effective legislation is needed to be justified.
The President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that "the seriousness of the workplace accidents that lead to death is of a social significance that we all feel and that institutions are required to put an end to it as soon as possible".
"The data on workplace accidents show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still staggeringly high", noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"But we don't want this declining trend to be coupled with declining attention, because it's when attention is lost that the greatest tragedies happen".
"We believe that we are still not doing everything possible to combat the phenomenon at a general level, which could be solved through a complex programme of action.
We believe that stricter supervision and controls and more direct intervention in the field of labour market training, starting with school education, are needed.'
"Further efforts are also needed to inform and make the public more receptive", he added.
What would be most needed, however, is a more responsible work environment in the face of a phenomenon that poses a social problem.'
Mercandelli subsequently criticised the "gradual deterioration of the compensation protection network for workplace accident victims" and the "aid direction towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The goal is to restore the safety of workers under insurance, because the fate of those who suffer accidents cannot depend on the arbitrary and arbitrary actions of lawmakers".
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
The use of portable audio equipment for longer periods of time and at high volume, such as MP3 players, may cause permanent hearing loss,
The Commission's report on the new and newly identified health risks (SCENIHR) was published in Brussels, citing the opinion published today by the European Commission.
"The study found that between five and 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour a day for five years at a high volume level have a permanent hearing loss", says the explanation.
"It is alarming that young people who use high-powered portable music players and cell phones in large numbers and frequently do not realize that they can irreversibly damage their hearing", said Meglena Kuneva.
'Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk that needs to be addressed urgently,' the EU Commissioner added.
The main task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on this matter widely.
In the light of that opinion, existing control systems should also be reviewed in order to operate with adequate efficiency and to keep pace with the latest technologies.'
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine possible measures to protect children and young people affected by the noise caused by portable toys and similar devices", said the member of the committee.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level for portable music players at 100 dB, but there is growing concern about data on hearing loss resulting from the overuse of such sound sources.
However, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise that can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
The EU Scientific Committee's opinion states that for those users of portable players who listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise levels exceed the current maximum level for noise at work.
If you listen to music for longer in similar circumstances, you're at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5 to 10 percent of users of the wearable device, which could be 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno is setting up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs through March, and results are expected in June.
This is the schedule set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the work of the committee called "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will work on the Rome Decree.
Following the March final, the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee will evaluate the study and the plans so that the Municipality and Mayor-General Gianni Alemanno can submit a strategic plan for the capital officially approved in June.
"It is a completely independent committee representing all political, social and cultural ideas", emphasises Alemanno, "and its task is to develop proposals for the development of Rome on which policy-makers, the General Assembly and the Local Government Committee, can rely.
There is no question of any conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the good of Rome.
In March, after the committee has completed its work, it will be dissolved because it has a fixed term.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the committee entitled "The future of the capital of Rome", the mayor-general said.
To those who consider the Commission's work unnecessary, citing that the expert opinion it has drawn up has no binding force, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard is proved to be adequate, as in France in the case of the Attali Commission, which I am sure will be the case in Rome, the contribution it makes will play an important role.
The power of politics is often overshadowed by the handling of everyday affairs and the handling of emergencies from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further, and we plan for the longer term, and we are committed to working for the development and future of Rome".
The Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that 'this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'water pool', as it is completely free, will not cost a euro to the citizens of Rome, but is a thought-provoking and aims to involve the most outstanding minds of the capital'.
Alemano said that "an open-ended and flexible strategic framework is needed to enable our city to make the leap of quality it so much needs, thinking in unity about its future".
Regarding the future, which the mayor of Rome emphasizes will "not only be confined to the current governance framework but look far beyond", it not only sees the future metropolis and capital status but also "the role that Rome can and should play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who declared himself independent wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
He was the first Jimmy Carter to ruin the American economy by his decisions and to maintain close ties (as he does as a private individual today) with hostile Islam".
As the election gets closer, attacks on Obama will intensify.
A Miami woman posted on the Internet: "This man is ambitious.
Obama is unfazedly convinced that he can achieve the highest civil dignity of a nation that has had two governors and five senators who are black".
These attacks are actually meaningless; they're racist, of course, but they don't answer the voters' question of whether he's going to be a good president.
In this case, there are those who listen to their emotions rather than their minds.
In the heart of the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial that we know very well who the real American patriot votes for in the polling booth.
There's a side of American thinking that's been hidden until the last minute.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the twins, Obama or McCain".
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Never before have they spoken such words until now when the success of a black candidate is almost certain.
Yet despite all the cleverness, the Democratic winning weapon is George Bush.
When asked about 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his term, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was so blown up that it flew home.
He lost 4,500 soldiers in Iraq, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
The majority still believe that Iraq was Bush's weak point.
There's a huge task ahead of George W.
The United States: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time has come for the curbs on publishing, and many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists what they thought about the future of their profession and its intellectual power.
Well, right now, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not state clearly that their concerns about credibility had decreased.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They think the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the newsroom, which is restricted to the editorial offices.
If we don't want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public means by it, to be reduced to a minimum, this problem must be solved, the journalists interviewed say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a clear and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed against electronic press.
It's not hard for the press to see where the web is going.
The largest publishers are breaking their way into the Internet, which many consider the "killer" of print media.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists rose to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they voted for technology, hoping that it might be in the journalism's best interest.
Today, the American press is torn between editorial managers, or editors, and the reporters who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, while at the local level, that number is only 23 percent.
Some people associate this with a safe job.
Nationally, 47 percent of executives fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, that's 30 percent.
In America, the question of "safe work" is on the team level (in our case, editors, editors) and is on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In a large nation of 300 million people, the United States, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a "should or shouldn't" basis.
Directors are usually paid a high salary, and editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance.
But freedom works on a rather complicated principle: x days in the first year, and x days in the third year, until after a certain period, the maximum is 15 days.
But American journalists, in their own words, often "get sick" during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The first is the "From the Heart" of the book.
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the Second Criminal Division of the Roman Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent who wanted to move from his home in Grottaferratà to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is currently under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the Unipol-BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, in the proceedings against him, his house arrest was dismissed and changed to a stay-at-home ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have asked the real estate professional to walk from a rural town to a capital apartment.
However, the Court considered that these moves (for which the Prosecutor had rejected the proposal) would allow him to influence the company's cases and access the evidence brought against him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote on the $700 billion bailout package the White House put forward: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in, and still are, in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday's New York Times report, which reports that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party that is increasingly dividing between the traditional, restrained, East Coast attitude that supports federal institutions and business circles and the growing new anti-Washington and financial world trend in the central and southern states.
This trend was made clear in a critical way during the House vote referred to in the introduction.
But this is just one of the significant changes that the economic reorganization that is still taking place, not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps beyond, can foretell or predict.
It seems that the crisis in the United States and Europe is only accelerating the long-standing phenomena that are consolidating in this new environment and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualisation, the bringing back to public consciousness of a dual category of state sovereignty, in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is affecting banks and financial institutions that, while having close links with foreign countries, are attracting mainly and quite widely people and families living in one country, one state.
But this poses a direct political challenge to those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So while the crisis seems global in an economic sense, it is almost exclusively national in a political sense.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially off the beaten track: a clear proof of this is the European Union, which, drawn between different interests and different national strategies, is unable to define a single political direction.
So everyone expects the individual national governments to intervene, to deliver a bailout, to revive and to introduce new rules, but above all to open up funds: because in a crisis situation only individual states have the economic resources, the financial resources that can make things right.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that are unlikely to be available to any other market or international organisation to such an extent.
At the same time, the new emphasis placed on nation-states by the crisis is fully consistent with the fact that economic growth in recent times has been increasingly attributed to a factor closely related to this element: territorial development.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were entering the world of the abstract, the world of the more sophisticated technology, and that the global financial world was meant to rule the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on abstract things like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one half of the planet to another, but can be completely confined to a certain place, to a certain area.
So whoever controls the territory has a lot more cards than whoever was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I'd like to turn to the second novelty, which is a kind of breaking point.
When you say territory, state, government, you're necessarily saying politics, in other words, leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two interrelated phenomena:
One is the objective recognition that we need authentic leadership, someone who can handle events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, has brought complete loss of credibility, who have proved completely unfit and proved that there is still a long way to go.
The two together are even more profound and in some ways even more disturbing: the sense of loss of faith, impatience, incompetence and isolation that increasingly affects the entire leadership elite in Western countries.
So it seems that the belief that the social elite that has been at its peak to this day is over, is spreading to a wider population, and it is over before their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, have been taken over, and this is increasingly alienating the social elite from the majority opinion.
In short, the demand for leadership is enveloped in a broad but strong delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system, manifested in the unexpected "depression" of voters, or in the sudden changes in public sentiment in recent times, such as the rise to power of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, or the U.S. Congressman's rebellion against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that with the traditional elite, its parties, programs, and even its media and its popular intellectual traditions, it is becoming less and less able to understand, and therefore less and less able to represent, what has been happening in the deepest layers of Western society for some time.
Yet, to speak of "the coming revolt of the masses" would be to be frankly exaggerated.
But it's not bad to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
With a super-powerful glue, you can beat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
Several American research centers have set this goal, and a group of four institutions are working toward a solution.
With a mere two and a half square centimeters of adhesive, the researchers were able to stick a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
THE U.S. journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team invented was the result of the development of pre-existing, special, new carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle should be viewed as a pack of spaghetti-like skin", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers developed the idea of a perfectly attached animal with its legs covered with microscopic scales.
Tests of various materials, such as glass, teflon, and paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the feet of the reptiles mentioned above, but "it is easily removed from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's engineering department.
"This material may be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You may find further applications in space exploration.
The superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California have introduced a fibrous, microwave-like adhesive that undergoes self-cleansing when moving on a surface, thus always providing perfect adhesion.
Fruit milk is forbidden.
You have to be careful with grapefruit, orange and tomatoes.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in summer, when they are introduced into the body with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effects, as the case may be, and can have serious health consequences.
The risks of using a combination of canned or fresh fruit juice and certain medicines were highlighted by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who reported at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange, or apple could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice was already on the defendants' bench when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety medications, heart rhythm regulators, and nerve drugs to levels considered toxic.
CONSUMMENTAL CONSUMMENT - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals itself published the news in its official press release, warning doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this concomitant use and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers have found that oranges and apples contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices can be made.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmacy at Milan State University, notes: "Discovery of this kind is usually immediately reported to various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, make sure that the information in the product information is changed.
Therefore, it is always important to read the pharmacy information sheet and, if something is not understood, not to be influenced, but to clearly consult our doctor or pharmacist", emphasized the Ansa Institute's experts.
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of business models and the territorial connections of economic activity.
55-year-old Neokynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a New York Times editorial that the latter event would have more fateful consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has sparked much controversy, and has been repeatedly put on the economist's eye, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I am surprised and somewhat shocked by how quickly public interest has moved beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, member of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist" but "expresses his criticism of the Bush administration's excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive fashion".
Open Office, third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open source, personal productivity-enhancing application package that is now available as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting a growing range of users from home to office, freelancers to government.
Supervised by SUN Microsystems and developed by volunteers for nearly a year, the new Open Office is bringing to the public with several new features: in addition to the greeting screen and the redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it also offers several significant innovations, such as compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-based Open Document Format (ODF) 1.2.
The focus has been on compatibility with Office 2007, allowing Open Office to open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) with the extension.
There are some other module-specific features that are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful for sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDFs into the graphics module by keeping the layout on the page.
Because we can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the sharing of workbooks but prevents overlapping each other's work.
Some companies are already working to make some of the features of OpenOffice available on the Internet (on the cloud, in the cloud), so the final version is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available in English since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can download the installation CD on request, either at home or at work.
The most attractive feature for home application adoption is probably free software, but the Open Office suite is now trying to catch up with the business sector as it can also support a number of government and school projects.
There is also no lack of ideal education, consultancy and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five core modules: Writer, a word-compatible text editor; Calc, a spreadsheet manager designed to replace Excel; Impress, a PowerPoint-like presentation; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to Access database manager; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but considering that the new version is already at 3,600,000, that number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's test is positive, this is the fourth doping case.
In the last stage of the Tour de France, Bernhard Kohl, one of the participants, who was also a member of the Gerolsteiner team, won the best mountain climber jersey.
The news was seen on the website of Equipe Internetes.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth such rider to produce a positive result in the Cera test, which he considered to be the third generation version of EPO, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany, who was also a Gerolsteiner competitor.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests we've done in recent weeks, has been tested by the Lausanne and Chatenay Malabry labs.
If the test results confirm the positive result of Cera, Austria will lose third place and will be banned from competition for two years according to the regulations.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, confirmed the positive result of Kohl's third generation EPO test and told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was able to keep pace with Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and won the top-ranked mountain climber's points jersey.
The New York Times is raising the question, is it racial?
Italy has recently become a popular destination for unwilling immigrants.
This is the question raised by the New York Times, which, based on the case of young Burkinabé Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of cookies - has dedicated a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is a good example of what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are "strongest in integration and highest in employment" while "anti-immigrant and Northern League support" is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cites events in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
I mean, actually.
New laws demanded by the League to tighten the grip on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants were also cited as examples of the change in mood in Italy.
The pope and the president of the Republic also highlighted this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and called for the cooperation of the state and the Church in the fight against racism".
Students suffer from high rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Union of Tenants, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such staggering proportions that, because of the enormous costs to families, it has kept a wide range of students from learning", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study department. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price movement has begun against local residents".
In most cases, the offer of a property also involves a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no limitation on rents, with a rental attached.
Sunia considers that an exceptional measure would be necessary to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The survey details that in Milan, near Brianza, a bed costs 450 euros; the average price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere) to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) but can reach 900 euros (Vittoria).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where most students live near the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros for two beds and 370-500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), the cost of a single bed is about 600 euros and a double bed 450 euros.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€550 per single room) in the other university districts (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In suburban areas, you can save a little: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, the cost of a bed is 300/450 euros, a room is 400-600 euros, and the highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
Another disadvantage is that in cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are also often looking for accommodation, the rental fees charged to foreign students are about 25 to 30% higher than those charged to Italian tenants.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, the cities sacrificed the age of the old movie theaters
Traditional movie theaters are closing in on the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema, a blind city, is like a face without eyes".
The images by Giuseppe Tornatore show the effect of what is happening in the Italian cities and rural areas.
The suppression of cinema - the emergence of large, multi-screen cinema in the suburbs and the consequent displacement of single-screen cinema in the city centres - is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time carries all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places disappear, "it's like a friend is leaving, a friend we've shared a journey with and many experiences with", says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which won an Academy Award and won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival twenty years ago, tells the story of a small-town movie theater, longing for a movie experience that may be lost forever.
The largest association of operators, Anec, has reported that 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years, with the biggest losses in the cities being 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the multiplexers are responsible for their disappearance is no better proof than that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-screen theaters in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of theaters has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It is normal to build new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all stores are willing to switch to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unpaid financial funds to support operators: the outstanding debt of the State can be estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It's ethically and morally shameful that the government doesn't follow the laws.
It would take EUR 16-18 million a year to maintain the market.'
The case of Bologna is particularly noteworthy, the first Italian city to resolve the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and promote the single cinema in the outer and inner cities.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and public benefits to promote accessibility: spectators can enter restricted areas and park in certain parking lots at a discounted rate.
"I like this initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, even with other measures.
But it's also clear that traditional movies, in order to be able to take on the battle against multiplex dominance, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audiences are much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheriya - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that eventually led me to create Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the closed Rialto or the Quirinale on the Via Nazional to avoid seeing the posters blackened by dust, I turn my head.
Tight lines between politics and the 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"Mayor Gioia Tauro has supported the Piromalli clan in local government decisions".
Serious charges have been filed against the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Calabria's Anti-Mafia Board of Judges, Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of outside complicity in a criminal conspiracy.
Bilincs was also handed over to Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his nephew, a lawyer named after the chief, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like criminal organization and ordered to pay €10 million in damages.
"Disregarding all legal and moral rules, much less good taste", state prosecutors write.
"The clan would have had an official visit to the town hall, which would have given it an additional opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian Regional Assembly, admits that there are "many collisions between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: there are areas where the mafia is more prevalent than elsewhere, where collisions are almost inevitable.
But many local politicians resist the pressure of 'the ndrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean.'
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events of July, when the police announced they had succeeded in beheading the Piromalli clan.
In late April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to run the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a zealous Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the dissolution, led the centre-right coalition in the second round in 2006.
He shouted scandal when the Congregational Commission ordered the disbandment of the local government committee.
He summoned Marco Minnini, then Deputy Interior Minister, to the court and accused him of plotting the whole thing with political intent, but the court in the arrest warrant signed this morning explained that the Piromalli clan had been so bold as to demand a change in the A3 project.
The prosecutors wrote that the hearing against Dal Torrioné showed that he was "willing to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs, known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the local government to the interests of the clan".
That energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy that covers 70 percent of the planet's surface, and it's only just been discovered by the big international energy companies.
Waves, tides, tides, all renewable energy sources that have been looked up by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on.
For a hundred years, they've been exploring the possibility of extracting energy from the ocean's motion, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, they explored it.
The idea of using marine energy was abandoned around 1980, when the price of crude oil fell, but today environmental demands and the renewed rise in crude oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by ocean-going power plants.
That's twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
Besides, there'd be currents and currents.
The giants are in the air.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement for a power plant to be built in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is considering collaborating with us", a spokesman for one of the U.S. oil giants' associates told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the approval of the US Energy Commission to launch the Alaska project for the recovery of marine energy.
This is not insignificant, especially considering that the United States is currently mining in Alaska, and even President Bush recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also developing offshore energy, and the investments so far, as far as the details are concerned, are evidence of growing interest.
The technology is still in development.
Experts say that this is still a very early technology, just because the energy from the sea does not dispel any doubts about environmental impact.
The existing facilities, like those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not pose a major problem for the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities with a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a connected boiler system, for example.
The impulses generated by the waves and the booms moving up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the plungers and hoses placed inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine, which powers a generator.
Electricity is delivered to land by cables drawn under the sea.
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning stages, which are only awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing power for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six underwater turbines located on the East River in New York.
When the water flows, it turns the turbine blades, and this rotational motion powers the generator.
Verdant said it had a long list of partners waiting for permits only for energy use.
Waves after waves.
The potential for the price movement is currently to be considered with a clear distinction.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the price trend is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, Alaska, and the other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 on the energy of the tidal wave, which is projected to grow to $35 million in 2009.
