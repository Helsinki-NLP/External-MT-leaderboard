Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair a collapsing highway system, many people are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and communicates that information to authorities, has become a controversial issue for Washington and the State Planning Office nowadays to restore obsolete systems to finance major U.S. roads.
The boring work of highway planning in general has suddenly become a matter of intense debate and lively alliances.
Liberation environmental groups have joined forces to gather support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you have driven, and possibly the location you have driven - and then use this information to draft tax bills.
Tea party is a mess.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising various privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move into a system in the next decade where the driver pays for every mile set on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
It is a really essential commodity for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not to choose", says Hassan Ikrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to begin tracking every mile set by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
Technology is the way to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, financed by taxes paid by US citizens on gas pumps.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now the car runs more miles than ever before in a gallon of gas.
There has been no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising a penny in taxes.
"Gas tax is not a viable option at all", says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, it will be the most logical option", they say.
WONX calls it mileage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea is appealing to urban liberals, as it could, for example, change taxes to change the way you drive, which could help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are eager for the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (A.P.A.), also considers the Black Box the most viable long - term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"It's not just doing what's going to go to the blind well", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who in their 2011 report favored moving toward mileage from Congress.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, which would have involved 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to walk many miles to work or the city every day, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon is the most interested, having listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying mileage fees to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing trucks on a limited basis.
The I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 state departments of transportation along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on cars of 50 volunteer drivers a short time ago, drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"Concern about Big Brother and other similar things was the major problem", says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and task-performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not what people wanted.
As the trial progressed, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into a full tracking device".
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology framework that must be necessarily spread to keep a record of every person's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of many states that is doing its best to get affordable technology that will allow states to get details of how many miles a day a car is running, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing has been liked by highway planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at certain intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this approach", said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
Some major errors have been made in these early programs of the state.
There are also very few costly and less intervention methods to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with offering different options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or choose not to take any devices again, but instead choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this hold can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are attempting to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate paying parking meter fees, provide "pay per your drive" insurance, and generate a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document states, "Motor drivers will be attracted to participate because of the benefits it will bring".
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion about mileage is a big distortion.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund very easily by raising gas taxes.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
"What radical surgery is needed when aspirin can be used", said Randy Rentsheller, the Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do this, millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died from drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the deceased's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation to the court.
It is noted that on 26 August, the police recovered the body of Jaheed Iqbal, a resident of Padashadhi Bagh, in Jhelum Daria.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
Police said in the report that the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman said in the interview that she had received the phone from a relative of her, Rohail Gauhar.
Rachel also lives in the pastures and was a friend of the late Jahied.
Ruhael was taken to the bath with Jahied in Jhelum after the Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid unwrapped his clothes and put all his belongings on the side, while Rahel went to the other side to smoke.
When he returned, Jahied was not there, only his clothes.
Rachael searched for Jahad, but he was not found.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Jaheed had drowned.
Police told the court that Zahid died from drowning and was confirmed in postmortem.
However, Ruhal has been detained under Section 404 for concealing the facts and belongings of the deceased.

MRF awarded JD Power Award for 10th consecutive time
Chandigarh: MRF, India's largest tire manufacturer and one of the top 15 global tire companies, has been awarded JD Power Award for the tenth consecutive time.
The award is widely considered the equivalent of Oscars by peers in the automotive sector and is the highest recognition in the industry.
Few companies have received this award for so many years.
MRF has increased the range of pharmaceutical radial tyres known as MRF JLO for high-end vehicles.
Low profile tyres of 40, 45 and 55 category are now available for vehicles from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar to many others. The 13 size range now includes more than 70 premium vehicle models of Indian roads.

Former Prime Minister of Italy, 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, known for his bungalow parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly intelligent manner.
This disclosure was made by his family friend, Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has served as Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Balucci when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
It is Francesca, whose relationship with Balrusconi was said to be a sham.
Berlusconi 's close friend and bungalow girl, Martelle Polanco, has revealed that she was also invited to the secret wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
In an announcement on Italian Radio2 when asked what would happen if they were married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former Prime Minister 's house.
No one can tell you anything else.
However, she did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
The couple got married about three weeks ago on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a woman who was 50 years younger than herself, 28 years old, engaged to Francesca Pascal.
To avoid the quirk, Berlusconi based his decision on solitude.
Even in the lowlands, the rain continued to fall in the middle of the sunshine.
With this, the cold wave has begun throughout the plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, -0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the whole state.
At the same time, strategically important Srinagar - Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to rain and snowfall.
Heavy snow has fallen on the Jhola Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the mountainous areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of the Western turmoil, snowfall in the high mountainous areas of the plaintiff began early on Wednesday and rains in the lowlands continued until late evening.
The cold also affected the normal life of the people.
People stayed indoors to avoid the cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply was also cut off in many areas.
The maximum daytime temperature of Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees below normal.
In Jammu, too, the cold has increased at night due to heavy rain and strong winds.
Minimum temperature of 16.6 and maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius were recorded in Jammu.
According to the Weather Department, the impact of the Western turbulence has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, Director of Srinagar based Meteorological Department, the weather in the Vadi is likely to be dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who was jailed for sexual assault, was again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
Asaram's media coverage is being presented as a blood-drinking child drakula, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathsivam refused to order the media to stop spreading news about Asaram, saying that they have seen every word reported in the media and see no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
The court was not impressed by the arguments and refused to intervene in the case, saying that they had other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram 's demand to ban media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the largest TDS theft ever.
The group operator of the mall paid the TDS to the relevant financial institutions by cutting it but not to the government treasury.
In doing so, he kept the TDS money with him.
The group was targeted by an investigation team from Mumbai on 17 October, in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
The same link examination revealed that the trader had cut TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday started the action of income tax survey on this group.
The group of the mall operator was raided and surveyed about 15 days ago.
The businessman, angry at the action, has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not yet ready to pay the TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them.
The investigating authorities have clarified that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
The demand for sweets increases with Diwali.
This leads to an increase in sales of cheap and counterfeit goods.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more glossy, colourful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against counterfeit food and chemical confectionery.
The department seized 70,000 Mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5,000 Splash from Quetta Colony.
As the demand for sweets in the market has increased, so has the demand for low-grade maize from Madhya Pradesh.
The information department received that the dirty maves had been brought to Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh.
The transport garage is being used to transport the cargo of the Mave to Nagpur.
The department took possession of the mave, which was valued at Rs.
The fear of action did not justify anyone.
The department considered it as unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided the Jitendra Catters in Quetta Colony and recovered about 5000 splashes.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to keep the glow glowing and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
The department's Co-Commissioner SS Deshmukh said that the campaign to catch chemical sweets and bad and fake masks will continue.
The department has informed that the campaign will be further accelerated in the coming days.
Consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the confectioners to make sweets from good milk, maize.
The Department has appealed to the people to beware of fake sweets and make - up.
42 senior BJP leaders from the state welcomed him to the airport.
It is worth mentioning that Modi has visited Bihar for a confort visit organized by BJP.
The organization of the Santwana Yatra is a BJP exercise to mourn the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is worth mentioning that a total of seven explosions were carried out one after another during the Narendra Modi hungar rally on October 27 in Patna.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts were intended to flee during the rally, so that more people would die and an atmosphere of terror would be created in the state.
The terrorists' plan failed, but six people died in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have taken a bone marrow from their village on their journey from Thursday.
On November 5th, their bones will be flown together into the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, a Consolation Journey is being organized.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
During the visit, he will also present a check of Rs.
The BJP has already announced this financial aid.
Enthusiastic about the explosive victory in the last match, the Indian team will be aiming to capture the series with a win when it lands in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI anytime to stay in the series after two ODIs were washed out due to rain and its batsmen gave it a record victory, bringing the team to a 2-2 draw in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved the goal of over 350 runs and once again the responsibility of crossing the team line will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak and even the biggest goal is proving dwarf.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As for the opening, the team has a welcome pair as Rohit and Shikhar which is making it easier for the rest of the batsmen to work with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great partnership in the opening and gave Virat the chance to play without any pressure.
Kohli's performance at number three has made him the future Sachin Tendulkar.
Many cricket pundits have even called him better than Sachin.
Virat, who will be 25 next week, has scored 17 ODIs, of which India has won 16.
He has an average of over 80.00 in the pursuit of goal and has emerged as the best finisher.
The top three batsmen of India are in strong form but excessive reliance on them can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODIs can be a lifeline for him.
As for Australia, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
He is also being sought in the Test squad for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hunge and Aaron Finch have not made an impact in the opening.
The lack of Michael Johnson in bowling could be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed well in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of peace.
Citing intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement released on Wednesday that Pakistan is pushing hard to get the nearly 2,000 terrorists to infiltrate its training camps.
For this he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more disillusioned after the separatists' plot to incite the people of Kashmir to wreak havoc on a massive scale has failed.
Citing the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lt. Gen. Zaheer Ul Islam, Lashkar, Hezbollah's Sargna Hafez Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be allowed to spiral in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border, the suicide bombings in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Calling the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state as lethal in such circumstances, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-people to speak like this till there is lasting peace in the state.
They give birth to anti - country elements.
He stressed that the comments of leaders who have deflated the army, security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on American watch
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence spokesman, has announced that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Strauss, met Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum to speak about testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government regards dissent as a party - change, and does not provide any defence that attempts to criminalize political speech with allegations of gangland".
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told the online Zeit: "Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it happen".
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. He said that if there was an opportunity for Mr Snowden to testify "without completely ruining relations with the United States and endangering them", then it should be taken.
Mr. Strauss Böll, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He said that he was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Straub Belén said that, according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had to leave his home because he had "encountered a terrible and persistent campaign".
However, he said the world is happy and overwhelmed by the wide response to his work of political expression.
The United States - including global citizens - as well as senior officials have condemned the disclosure of an irresponsible system of extensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for Carry-On Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for on-store baggage carrying for passengers on board its aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although it announced on Wednesday that passengers can carry the entire bag.
The new Carry - On charge is for bags in overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 would have to wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be earned to care for the charges in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him", he said.
The airline started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid the fare are charging as much as they can in carry-on luggage which is stacked in the overhead trunk, which means that this trunk often has less space.
The fee is a way to bring down for passengers on board.
O 'Malley said this new charge isn 't really about raising money.
It's becoming increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find a replacement for the overhead bin.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay it.
This means that the next person in line can pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of fees before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new Carry On Fee, will not start until summer though a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that it costs money to handle luggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of losses.
Most, though, have not even touched the carry - on bag fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first launched Carry - On Charge three years ago, and partner discount Allegiant Air later.
Another such fee is Hungary 's Wizz Air, which airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, and which tracks ad-on fees.
He said that Spirit 's carry - on charge brings $50 million a year which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines officer recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers at the gate by facing an unusual baggage charge.
"The boarding process I had seen in my airline career was straightforward", he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and they said it was lickety-split".
Frontier is also following the Spirit' $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier says that any passenger who takes soda, or juice can keep the whole can, and give this free coffee only once.
It will still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they backed down and followed after no other mainline was there.
Frontier's move to charge Carry On charges if Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is its latest effort to drive customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel seller Orbitz such as $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This is why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many began to pay half a mile of frequent flying time to customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip bought from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows only passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his home town of Denver, but it's losing money and declining business.
Revenue declined by 9 per cent and its flight capacity declined by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Frontier is trying to fix the finances as part of the Republic Airlines sale.
NSA accused "internal error" instead of hackers of causing the website to crash
The Mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiency, not due to hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, due to an internal error during the pre-scheduled update", the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that this obstacle was caused by the DDoS attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website was down for at least six hours, and the site is still inaccessible to some users.
An NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was "absolutely no " agreement with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesperson said.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to send such a large amount of traffic to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unfinished and attacks are not intended to intercept the internal networks of the target system.
The formerly highly secretive NSA, once dubbed "no agency like this", has been the subject of much public discussion and fierce criticism over the past few months over the high volume of foreign and domestic spy programs that have been exposed - following the theft and disclosure of secret NSA files from the agency by the collectively dispersed former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to the escalating controversy surrounding the agency, speculation was made after the incident that took place this evening that it was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The beautiful expression was presented in line with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya' which shows harmony between the Dwaper era and the present circumstances.
It showed how in today 's perspective a guru is bound to the wrong path by being bound in a bundle.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhupadalal Walmikhi, Deputy Chairman of the Camp Council, Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play depicted the similarities between the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwaper era and one of the present Professor Arvind.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhara Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a brilliant performance, doing full justice to the characters.
The lighting in the play was designed by the young colourist Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
The following ceremony was followed by the awarding of various awards by Aptha to distinguished literary and cultural contributors.
The Chair was given to Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Division, Singh Viv, Senior Journalist Shanbhunanath Shukla and Colorist Jitendra C. Raj.
The Executive Officers of the Executive Board have included Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, etc. in the success of the event.
Bombardier's profits as aircraft delivery declined, orders declined
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, as pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues and in the third quarter of its train unit decreased.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or provide an update on issues that would meet its ambitious schedule of the aircraft entering commercial service from next September.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown just three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has been sent to a sliding of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating for "matter" to "field performance" on Thursday as stocks are limited to being up over the next one or two quarters.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transport", Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the market programme is likely to be suspicious.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the flight test results to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as for CSeries the firm orders are as low as 177.
With 15 customers and operators, 403 complete orders and commitments are available.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jets were put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the event was going as scheduled.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than predicted", Bowdoin said in a conference call, adding it was also scheduled during the ground test and software update of the aircraft intervals.
Each manufacturer creates a schedule differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and have an updated period and said what we did.
That's why everything will be through the flight program.
The second remaining of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts believe customers are suspicious of the possibility of a CSeries aircraft starting operations in the first 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the Entry Service Schedule (EIS) and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our idea that service at the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15", Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year ago.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue plunged from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.

Net order dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment", said Baudouin.
Aerospace revenue fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, Division, had grown revenue by about 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogged at about $32.6 billion on September 30, up slightly from December 31.
Some major contracts in the Transport Division were also affected by issues of execution.
The executive officials said that new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.

Embraer SA of Brazil, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent quarterly profit drop on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
They do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening our minds change and we set aside ideals and start to walk against the rules.
In this research, researchers from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business at Utah have given some interesting facts.
Researchers have found that we prefer moral values when we are not stressed in the morning, but when we are tired or under excessive pressure in the evening, we lose integrity.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher to the left or to the right.
Participants were told that if they answered wrong instead of right, they would be paid.
The experiment showed that the subjects who were tested between 8 and 12 am did not make any mistakes and gave correct answers.
In the afternoon and evening experiments, people were found to have deliberately misinterpreted their rules.
This has led researchers to prove that greed for money does not affect our honesty in the morning, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the bad guys fled with a wave of tamche.
The family members have admitted the injured person to hospital in critical condition.
Sunder Son Sohanveer, a resident of Madhi village, has recently retired from the Electricity Department as an Awar Engineer.
On Wednesday, he was returning home by bicycle with Rs.44,000 from the Bhola branch of the Syndicate Bank.
Two scoundrels on bicycles from behind on the Bhola - Madri road stole 44,000 cash from Sunder.
When Sundar objected, the thugs shot him in the stomach, causing him to be wounded.
The family and villagers who got the information took him to the hospital in Meerut in critical condition.
No report was made on the case until the news was published.
It is worth mentioning that three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Ammanulapur resident Jasvir was shot and wounded by two thugs on his bike.
Police have not been able to disclose many more recent cases.
On the other hand, SO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents will be revealed soon.
Hotel staff protested and started beating.
The son of the drunk MP started a fight with the hotel owner 's younger brother RK Singh who came to his rescue.
Meanwhile, many more people came.
He tried to catch the young man who was beating him and he fired from the rifle.
The shooting spread sensation in the area.
The hotel staff arrested him and called the police.
Hotel owner Munna Singh, who arrived at the scene, filed a report against Anand Pandey, son of Gorakhnath Pandey, a Berwa Bahadurpur MP from Koirana, Badohi district.
Police seized the rifle while arresting Anand.
According to Handiya Inspector Ashok Saraswat, the fat man from Pratapgarh, Munna Singh runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on the National Highway.
At about 8 pm, Anand Pandey arrived at the hotel and ordered food.
When the meal was late, he began to make fun of others, beat them and fire them.
Anand was drunk and threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The inspector says that the hotel is near the village of Bhiti and adjacent to the Badohi district.
Mr. Big jailed for giving secret information about police investigations to a cocaine addict.
42 - year - old Basharat Ditta reported to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defense's top lawyer, who informed Mr. Big of the main police investigation because he feared people would know about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After Barasht Ditta, 42, settled on his cocaine addiction, he provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities investigation.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" and hailed as "Top Brief" by the perpetrators, was arrested in 2011 from his home in Scarborough following police surveillance operations, which he had represented in the previous narcotics trial.
Officials saw Scarborough, 32, carrying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Ditta 's hair, wallet, and credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of class A drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who were jailed by the police after seizing heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
Ditta, 42, was a whistleblower for fear that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, a lawyer at the Forbes Law Firm in Blackburn, was facing a failed trial at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to possession of cocaine at the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad days began when police discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta since February 2011 while investigating Scarborough.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta 's house and holding drugs of more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer 's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was administered, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer arrived at the house and found that drugs were in the house and that they had had nine conversations.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test after traces of a class A drug were found on her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine and said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said his discussions were a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by taking out his wallet, but they were seized, and his hair sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he ran the office from his workplace as well as his home, and his clients called his home for legal matters.
After the principal persons arrested told what the detectives knew about them, the court heard that Ditta called the heads of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously filed cases.
"Criminal counsel should be the best at not breaking the law", said Anne White, a prosecutor.
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, of being too attached to his particular client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a common drug dealer, but a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would have been without a doubt legal, since he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limitations of lawyer - client relations.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting his profession, not respecting it.
He made a lot of close contact with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed himself to settle.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "At the same time that Mr Ditta started getting drugs from organized criminals, he transformed himself from criminal lawyer to criminal".
His cocaine addiction led him to compromise and become much more vulnerable to the aims of leading members of organized crime groups who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of honesty and should inspire confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape his profession.
The Lancashire Crime Unit investigated Mr Ditta, who was also found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is far from the reach of the law.
We will search you and present you to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty - five other gang members were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta posted a question and answer session about herself in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be an attorney for a death penalty client in the US, to be her dinner guest for Muhammad Ali and to be the inspiration for his work.
Kenya's press outraged by the controversial media law
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said: "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is to prevent Parliament from depriving the judiciary of its freedom in the coming day?"
Cyrus Kamoo, Managing Director of Capital Group - which is the operator of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM, said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it".
He said the new Media Tribunal "will always be biased, as it is part of the government itself" and said that banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send the MPs back", he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had "been hit hard" and called the bill cruel.
The Bill is being passed as a measure to strengthen national security after the September Islamic gunman attack on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the squad sent to the scene of the attack, showing them deliberately looting the mall, which angered the Kenyan media.
Police Chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and media workers for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a riot by the media.
Under the new Bill, media companies could be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could be fined 1 million Kenyan shillings and, in addition, the additional risk of being "deleted from the list" or not being recognised by the official press would be different.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the infringer 's property if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a penalty is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations".
It also said that these measures could lead to the devastating impact of what Kenya describes as the "living blogosphere".
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their own thing.
Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew describes the Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "No one will ever know".
He wrote, "If left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and deposition".
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public outrage.
In May, he had voted to reject the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored the tax-free salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
The birthday of Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian in the world, is on November 1st, but as soon as the clock struck 12 on the night of October 30, the whole of Jodhpur began to resonate with the birthday of Nita Ambani.
The atmosphere of the celebration was previously composed entirely of the performance of the team of AR Rahman.
In this musical night which started at 8 pm, Rahman gave presentation of his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to unravel the beautiful colors of the dance.
About 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests attending the Nita Ambani Birthday.
Charter Parking at Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur was cancelled due to limited parking space at Jodhpur Airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars were ordered from BMW and JugR.
The cleanup system in the city, street lights have completely failed, Sud said.
No action is being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Huda to run the City Centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula abolish the household tax altogether.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sud said that after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors but they do not have the power to get the job done.
As a result, the city council has become a dummy and the officials are acting on their own terms.
Sood said that the Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being collected by depositing it in the form of FD in the banks.
No steps are being taken to invest the money for the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of doping ground is the most serious.
The people living in the over-the-counter sectors have been forced to live a hellish life through the past several rains due to the creation of dumping ground in Sector 23.
Municipal authorities have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in Gadhav Churiwala for the past several years, but people in the Barwala area are already getting two - four times the serious problem of flies.
He said that the health and education system in the villages is in a very poor condition.
No work has been started to provide facilities to people in rural areas till date.
The UN set new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDD, which expires in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in pushing forward the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the overnight SDA summit in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it is time to "rise above national interests".
"I am delighted that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals", he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to achieve our long-term objectives of Sustainable Development Goals based on MDG success.
Mozambique's security concerns are growing as powerful figures clash
With a statue of the Mozambican founder President Samora staring down at him, thousands gathered in central Maputo for a rare public demonstration to chant peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability", said Vanessa de Souza, CEO of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress to a "We demand security" shirt in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Freedom Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, clashes between government forces and Re Namo have been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years ago, a peace agreement was signed.
Remo Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa, initially as part of efforts to destabilize the country 's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a fully developed conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, which could bring in over $50bn in investment from some companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Eni and exploring the vast offshore gas and coal reserves of the Northwest next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Rae Namo blame each other for the tension.
Remo says the government launched the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members on October 17 in Sofa La Province, a traditional Remo Fort.
The government forces attacked Renmo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mahanang, a spokesman for Ray Namo, the Financial Times reported.
The government blames Rae Namo for triggering the clash, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Jibuzan has called for a disregard for concerns about instability.
Mr. Ghibusan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakaama saw himself as a "loser" "whoever the forces are trying to prove they can enforce their own decision on the government".
Both Free Limo and Ray Nemo insist they want to avoid war.
Mr. Maang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by Rae Namo but has since become a matter of concern.
He told FT that the agreement was not being awarded by Free Limo.
Our vision is to return to the compromise negotiations, but seriously", said Mr. Maarang.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing to reduce the tensions of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men (Gibuzha and Dhaka) fighting together", said Joseph Han, a lecturer and Mozambican expert at the London Open University.
Some of them are not good negotiators and some of them are not necessarily ready to make concessions.
Ramo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken about boycotting the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
The share of Rae Namo in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Rae Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) hopes to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Maarang says Mr. Jibuzanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country 's democracy.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want to leave the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want transparent elections", said Mr. Maang.
It is not clear what kind of capability Ray Namo has, but it is a major North South Highway on police stations and vehicles that he has made disruptive hit and run tours.
Most of the clashes have taken place in the province of Menay, several hundred kilometers north of Zomaputo, which hosts the port of Bera which relies on coal exported by miners, including Rio Tinto and the valley.
In June, after the threat of an attack on the Remo Line, the railway suspended its operation for about a week.
Mr. Mahanangvinnit was almost asked if Remo would be able to repeat this threat.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique which wanted to alert the international community", said Mr. Maarang.
The government of instability has further exacerbated the riots, says Fernando Lima, head of Media Cop, an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People are the people responsible for the future of the country, the government and the president, and he thinks he should be the one to find solutions to problems", he says.
Omar Sultan, an exhibitor, people still need sustainability.
"No one cares about the RN and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets", he said.
Children should be taught "myths and legends as a model for the author of life.
Thor 's stories could show "No small combat in the power of cruelty", while Arthurian legends show the importance of having a dream.
Even to teach many of the myths "it would be inappropriate to teach it in wild and in some cases even in obscenity and schools, exceptionally far away", Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the age - appropriate works of "carefully selected".
"I find it surprising, in America, that myths and folktales are already part of education", he said.
I've been sponsoring this as a plan for 20 years.
He called writers and teachers "more informative" and it is "a new turn" for children, as well as messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo - Saxon and wrote a book of Norwegian myths and British folktales called Penguin, said: "You may have many intentions but it's better to keep it out of sight".
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult author for a child and writing an adult author for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything is to be simplified or to come to a happy end, because but it is an intuitive sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than revealed through a story.
Not showing the old base.

Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in the United States: About a hundred years ago, comedian and playwright Frank Fey, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to play jokes directly to the crowd in a conversational manner.
Fa's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, which was conceived and hosted by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute, Carolyn's, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to the point where they became too big to play in a club", Hirsch says.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among other artists.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as Comedy Central, FX and small network shows like Spike.
Nick Kroll came to prominence from the deep - cable sitcom (F.X.X.'s rave ranchy fantasy - football - themed "The League"), and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On".
Other young comedians with different voices, including Kroll and Slate (with a completely different, frustrating voice, Anthony Jassallonic, satirical, ethnically focused W.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg speaking to Larry David:
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continued to fall to $ 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as a report offsets concerns about oversupplies as the power starvation construction sector in China is strengthening.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel by late morning in electronic trading in Europe on the American crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen 5.8 per cent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
The supply of sufficient crude oil has weighed in on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by over 25 lakh barrels.
But a surge in activity suggested strong demand, which showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came in on Friday.
This suggests that growth from a two decade to a third quarter can continue to strengthen China 's economic recovery after falling below 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Brent Crude, also a benchmark for international crude used by US refiners, dropped 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's rest and sports policy.
On Thursday, a federal appeals court blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Shira Schindler has said that the judge's decision will be pending on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the constitution was violated by excluding people from his program of arrest and interrogation.
The city Police Department has appealed its findings and its treatment order, including the decision to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and its associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the request for migration on Tuesday.
The Court has stated that because he agreed to the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in a series of media interviews and deviated from the code of conduct for US judges by the public, he should be removed from the judge's case for misconduct, statements of appeal should be publicly held accountable for criticizing the Court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and sports program.
He has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some premises where it gets closest.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police arrest.
An oral argument on the appeal of the Municipality is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The pause and sporting device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
Breaks and sports policy has been around in some form for decades, but has largely been recorded from black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 that stops the growth dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.
Supporters of the change in the NYPD's pause and sports program have said that inappropriate behavior will end by forming a more reliable and effective police force and may affect the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce police morale, but will solve a broader problem of police force under pressure from crime, money wasting and the shrinking of thousands of officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that the suspension and sports were not terminated, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
The training was attended by a large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chhatra district.
During the seven days, all participants were informed of various subjects including tent pitching, flagpole.
The training obligation is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are sharing the spirit of unity by joining in the All-Dhamma prayer.
Camp Head Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving special support.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm classified information
Andy Colson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called classified information about their affairs while Charles Clark was Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glen Mulcair to hack into Polby's voice mail and "watch" the man, but Colson called and dropped his voice mail.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's houses and watch them, but rather to put articles in front of people to see how people react to him", said Mr. Addis.
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face - to - face.
The third included the editors themselves.
He obviously knew about other methods, which is, the way of the Nigharni.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
They say, "No, we say, "Yes, he knew".
The rumor about Clark's affairs was first reported by the A.O.T.W. feature desk when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
At least three times a voice mail tape was seized from Ms. Polby's phone from Mulcare's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator 's computer that were named "Project" for Ms. Polby and her sister.
During the period of her investigation, Ms. Polby 's grandparents were called anonymously to ask for information about her.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Nevely Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup observed the monitoring of the arrival and departure of Ms. Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him in a voice mail: "I have a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, and I would definitely like to talk to Charles about it".
Mr. Addis said that Colson's involvement in the case is in the hands of other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had interviewed Mr. Blanket about romantic relationships with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson & Brooks refused to confuse others for hacking phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlback and WeatherUp have admitted to hacking the phone.
The NSA 's disclosure about state surveillance has fueled corporate fear.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed into the US consulate in Germany's financial capital Frankfurt.
On the instructions of the Office for the Defense of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a photograph of the roof of the US post office, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the listening antenna and signal an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the United States should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and increase American companies' international competitiveness or boost their bottom line" again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who became a whistleblower, began revealing the treasure trove of secrets to American surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazil 's oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potentially targeted.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use this data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies, the US is now almost as much a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
All the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence to date that the US knew foreign companies' trade secrets to its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU 's lack of internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are questioning this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly again...
"There is no way", said Haso Platner, president of German business software company SAP.
If a strong European IT industry wanted it, it would not have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is discounted, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about US technological sophistication and intelligence access have proved a shock to some companies who previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
There is a big shift in the cloud computing space where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosure of the data prism mining program.
Jim Snape, SAP's co-CEO says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't have a year ago: 'Where is my data stored?' And can you guarantee that it will physically remain within that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore should be guarded at all costs.
That there is economic espionage is not surprising.
It always has.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we do, because it's in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defence systems and this is an advantage to the attacker.
For large companies, it's been a long time since messages were recorded whether it's unwise to leave a home in business with a USB stick, or a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at car maker Audi, says that it's a very old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to the risk of overseas trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were then discarded.
However, the risk of hacking and monitoring of small and medium enterprises is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it is the number one company in the global market in a particular place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy against unauthorized access", warns BfV in a report.
The United States has warned against economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
France named US national intelligence in February, along with Russia and Israel, as a second tier of criminals involved in hacking behind China for economic intelligence, according to The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, "the French are the worst when it comes to economic espionage".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview: "The services know well that all countries, even if they support non-terrorist combat, spy on their allies".
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we do, because it's in the national interest to protect our business.
No one made a fool.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in a "unique accident" believe their son was murdered.
A Georgia teenager whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped inside his high school gym on January 11 in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers.
Investigators from the Lundes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson died in a freak accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied this.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "they fully believe that their son has been murdered".
They have no confidence in death as the sheriff has said.
"They believe that this is beyond the laws of physics and the logic of common sense", Krump said.
They think this finding is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag", he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulroney said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was he murdered for a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation", he said.
Moore told the reporter that preliminary autopsy shows Johnson died as a result of "static respiratory arrest".
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death".
"There are many questions that must be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal in Johnson 's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative from the Londage County Sheriff 's Office was not immediately available for comment.
On Wednesday, a judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC issues guidelines for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first time such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of schoolchildren suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now, one in 20 children in the U.S. has food allergies.
CDC found that food allergy cases in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to handle them in case of allergic reactions.
Schools are also advised to stock up on epinephrine to combat potentially fatal acute graftitis (anaphylaxis) - the most commonly used auto - injector of the epinephrine brand.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stock up on higher amounts of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say, "It feels like something is sticking to my tongue", "It feels like there's hair on my tongue", or "It's getting creaky in my tongue".
Parents of intersex children can choose their children's gender indefinitely
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise the third gender for children born with vaginal genitals.
Newborn children will no longer be designated male or female in a traditional manner.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "uncertain" or "uncertain" on the child 's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make rash decisions regarding gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I am neither male nor female".
I will remain a wounded, stained by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under examination of sexual developmental disorders, a collective term used for an abnormal chromosome, genital tract (ovariate or testicular), or an abnormally developed sex.
It may be that the Wallis Simpson were intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender determination cannot be made, it is best to use the best available information to identify gender and, if such a development occurs, to monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender identity issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children create moral discord.
"Some people are in a life - crisis situation that requires surgery, but most children are not", he said.
You can specify sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's kind of a puzzle about why people are gay.
Intersex people are described differently from transsexual or transgender people in a report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 because their status is not related to gender but to its biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor explicitly female but either a combination of both or neither is explicitly defined.
These characteristics may themselves exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now special camps are being held for boys with non - conforming sexes.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognised "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal for life-long "unspecified" gender status.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passport will have a third specification for intersex persons as X in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also opposed the German law, saying, "While the world is moving to a state where gender is a choice of choice, not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in opposite directions".
The mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would like to see children be gendered at birth.
He said on his website about parenting, "Parenting without additional limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is".
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bigenic), after the beautiful Greek goddess who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a slate that could be erased and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, realizing that gender recognition is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors can make mistakes, not knowing how children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'mental emergency,'" says Drasher.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory of the treatment of children with vaginal genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender to be valid.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental signals - how parents raise a child - by interacting with the child's genes and hormones determine whether he or she is identified as male or female.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally lost during a circumcision to remove the child 's testicles by completely binding it and to make it look like a girl.
"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it didn't happen", Drasher said.
At the age of 15, the child transformed himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drasher said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern".
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, these gender surgeons began to show up "not happy with the results".
The same was true of 36 - year - old Montana author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but had an unclear genome.
Doctors did not clearly understand whether her penis was small, or her scalp was large, but they were sure that she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce was removed from her external organs and ovaries by surgery and raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl".
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, she was about to be subjected to vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, she demanded medical records.
This revealed to him the terrible truth.
I was taken into exile at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing sufficient amounts of testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took a testosterone supplement and removed his breasts.
The surgery left her barren.
Today, he works at an organization called Interface Project to encourage people to normalize their perceptions of intersex individuals.
But Anne Tamer-Matisse, the managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that German law "invites gossip and slander".
"Many activists believe that German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to designate the child 'undetermined,'" she says.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think that it is a better process to specify the gender of the male or female than to wait.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matisse said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified as third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender", he said.
German law concerns the specification of the time of birth.
This is not the battle fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law would "empower both parents and children".
Baratiji 's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen graft was defective, female attributes developed in Katy.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to avoid making any decisions on their own in a hurry", Baratz said.
It gives them time to understand and understand them properly by some tests before writing man or woman.
This way, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not need to rush to a surgery that cannot be reversed.
"It brings children into the decision making process and frees parents from the suspicion that motivates them to believe they are not doing well", he said.
Eventually, the child will decide which gender he is more comfortable with -- and that would be a good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Legal awareness camp was held at the Middle School Dalhare in Ramnagar, chaired by the Chairman of the Committee and Sub Judge of the Committee, Sandeep Kaur on behalf of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar.
In which students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bharadwaj and Sarpanch in the camp, speaking on the subject, raised awareness among the people.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Consideration of the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Biden as Vice President for Hillary Clinton's ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in Revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign Tom by Mark Halperin and John Heilman, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that top advisers to the president held "broad group sessions and polls in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's falling hopes for re-election.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the efforts of the chief officials in the campaign and the White House, named after former White House chief of staff Bill, to find out what effect the change from Vice President to Secretary of State Clinton has on the polls.
The potential switch was a very secure secret inside the infrastructure of the Chicago Campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers, including Dr. Dalle, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlord and David Paluffe - knew the changes were under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dalle tried to change Biden despite his personal alignment before finally making a decision when his information suggested that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dalle has confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said it in the context of the whole scene, and one of them was this", Dalle told the newspaper.
Remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dalle described the research as "cautious", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out how much the claim would yield in a poll.
"Campaigns don't spend money like voting and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something", Martin told AC360.
It's unclear, though, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the potential change.
While Dalle said he "doesn't think the president knew about the potential change", the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" Definitely: Will not answer whether a political investigation reached Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know about the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably", said Martin.
Do you like the glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of marine animals to develop a great breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists used chemical glow to glow proteins.
Ice cream, by reacting with the tongue of the eater, will increase the pH of the protein and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is lit up when you react to the heat of your mouth, which means the more you chew, the more it lights up.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lik Me Am Delicious, said: "It's incredible, but the early days of production cost me £200 to get about 2 grams of stuff".
The protein we use in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seems perfect to share on Halloween because it gives amazing glow effects.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me about £140.
However, the taste of iska is very good.
Charlie's Bristol - based experimental company, Apne is famous for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream".
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the ice cream surface, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a useful anti-glare property of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was clogged with customers at the Rani Bagh Market.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
This was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and the Central Market in Pasihan Vihar.
Similar sight was seen in the Saraf shops of Pithamapura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here too, people bought gold and silver jewels and coins.
This caused the blockage of other markets including the Outer Ring Road.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in the jam to get home.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet until late and play dressing up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more than a greedy person.
I haven't even signed up to get candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that I have a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually spending $158 million this time around on Halloween, $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always noticed is the Halloween trends.
According to NRF, out of the total cost of $6.9 billion, the cost of clothing is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year, everyone is angry with sexy inanimate objects.
Women don't have to be prostitutes, because it's just sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I hope that thanks to lots of zombies, and the dead, space will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched outfits will be zombies, Batman, robbers and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will spend literally $330 million on pet clothes.
This is ironic with so many hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The Hayrush Bar, Lollipop, Milk Dads, Twistlers and Clark Bar are worth around £600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and the jokers, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
According to the Confectioners' Association, one thing we won't use is candycorn on Halloween, but it will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's the personal cluster of about 9 billion of Mecca.
It 's a mystery.
There is nothing more than the elemental Halloween Ghost House.
They're the best names, "Panic behind the Wall", "Cheek-o-cheek", and "House of Shock".
In fact, according to American authorities, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million dollars of revenue, and the awesome good pictures your friend posts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on you with a nice face.
Finally, let us talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o'-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin" trend started last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not hanging out with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
The slow-burning lantern on its front porch probably came from Illinois, which this year grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you're looking for extra credit, try to call Tim and Susan Matisda in Napa, Calif., and above to carve their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
"It was decided to issue a postage stamp with a photo of Sachin during the pre-match presentation", MCA said in a statement.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for the toss which MCA will hold.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements by people from business, sports and journalism world about him.
The Union said that the limited number of brochures and coins will be distributed to the members of MCA and BCCI.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats will be distributed each day which will have photos of Sachin.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
It has racing seats in the interior and six - point harness belts, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include - upgraded brakes, service package that provides access to ball work mechanics, logistics assistance, and vehicle collection between events.
"The rally customers who come to the bowlers have changed", said Bowler Motorsport's Managing Director, Drew Bowler.
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for a path to enthusiasm and excitement and world class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Roller and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigidity and authenticity of rally raids.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really fun championship.
In addition, Defender Challenger will also offer the option to compete in Training and Test Day in February as well as Desert Event in North Africa and Middle East.
The dream of fireworks traders to trade in the fireworks market in the transport area did not come true.
Fireworks traders have been trapped in the mud after the High Court order.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary fireworks market built at Ranjit Avenue nor have they been issued a license to trade in the transport area.
The Commission, constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, declared the temporary fireworks market located at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs. 1 lakh for not having adequate management there.
The High Court has in its order strongly rebuked the administrative authorities of Amritsar for what administration failed to solve a problem of fireworks traders for nine years.
They could not be given proper accommodation in the city.
After this, the appropriate security arrangements were made and fireworks traders were asked to issue licenses for business only in the market located in Shipgarh.
The fireworks traders were happy after the order, but the police turned the tide on their happiness on Friday.
The team of the Asalha License Branch of the Police reached the Pataka Market and put a counter there and sold the farm.
The conditions which were then set out to him were not possible to meet in one day.
Anup Kumar, in charge of the ACP East Gorav Garg, Asalha License Branch, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma Pataka Market has arrived at the market.
He expressed his dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the fireworks traders.
Therefore, the license was not issued to the fireworks traders.
Diwali is one day away.
This has disturbed the fireworks traders.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Fireworks businessman Abhinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desaraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni have said that if they lost crores of rupees they would sue the district administration.
Angry fireworks traders marched from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
Slammed against the police and district administration.
After this, the temporary fireworks market in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy at the foot of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above ground in a mine.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a small road accident.
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from death.
After Papi somehow got stuck on the slope of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground, he got a lucky life by calling firefighters.
Nine month old Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denham, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After running away after a minor accident, he had searched like madmen for his lost dog, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby on a mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet above ground.
A technical rescue team from Clackheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and used a tube to pull Ruby down by rope to save her and bring her down from the rock.
Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical situation.
It was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not make a single move during the rescue, he remained a stone.
But now she's fine.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It is incredible to see a dog.
"Ruby is lucky to have survived", said Peter Law, a special technical rescue officer.
He was likely to be seriously injured or in worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be fine apart from fatigue and dehydration.
"It was terrible to see the rescue", said Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire.
At first I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to have her back in my arms.
The vet said that if she was too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We are grateful to them, and they were all great.
"We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there", said Mr. Elderson of Keighley.
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, Pone Star said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with a senior rocker, and when I was 18, he hit me".
"It's getting old, and he treats me well", she said.
A representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry".
The representative also said: "Perhaps Parry is speaking about them in the misunderstanding of another person".
Perry was one of the singers to appear as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Kerrivan: The break-up of the Euro gave the Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control at Berwick and the wire lines on Hadrian 's walls suggest stories about the boundary.
It is true that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it did not cover the headlines.
Neither did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as they need to.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels would have a discount for a sustained non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, again, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has frozen. I first heard the baseless news about "freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old tale.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why buy and sell the York of London to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great postwar plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Parties devoted to opposing the EU or closing the euro as a single currency are gaining strength throughout the EU.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly came and got about fifty million votes in the September federal election, effectively excluding the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis proved to be a turning point.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the obstacles imposed on national economies through the adherence to the same currency have led many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play a very large role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its currency exchange rates in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a position with inherent productivity losses compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - which is encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and monetary problems are far beyond the depths of European productivity sickness.
To provide a discount to French and German energy firms at consumer expense - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even if all wages in the world are frozen, the European petrochemical industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians saw the EU as a means of keeping Germany in control, and Paris as a means of providing the world with Washington's equivalent billing.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to shake.
Results: The right-wing, anti-EU National Front, led by Marine Lee Payne, has won the recent by - election, pushing the ruling Socialist to third place.
The Front is the most popular party in France at the moment with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British workers that they cannot go on believing that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Lee Payne doing with his newfound fame among the white French working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti-EU, all-out anti-money faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is very likely, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, this kind of faction could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the union of anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will bring the euro to an end.
The euro will not be completely gone, but it will return to a form like "Europe of Sovereign Nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its successor economies may retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its proximity to the US.
Washington's growing interest in the Pacific, however, suggests Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after this?
We can choose to remain the Territory of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to secede at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for the non-Federated nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-mythical political campaign in Europe, having won a staggering majority in 2011 on the basis of the proposed (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early growth
Research shows that African - American and Hispanic girls reach puberty at a younger age than their age group of white girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks may be a cause of puberty at a young age.
Premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Ethridge, a former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter starts developing breasts and developing genital hair at the age of 7 or 8 years?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, reflecting a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time assuring parents that - in general - this does not reflect rapid progress toward full puberty", says Caplovitz.
Direct developmental symptoms such as breast - onset, genital and forehead hair and physical odor are pronounced in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first monthly - religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, the first period takes at least two to three years", explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of "Premature puberty in girls: a guide necessary to deal with this common problem".
The most accurate test of puberty is the time.
There is debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when breast growth occurs before the age of 8 years, two refer to it as "child - adulthood".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
In the case of more rapid progression, examination by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs, but admits, "Opposing youth can increase behavioral issues, and girls can start to feel different from their peers".
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their young daughter to have a menstrual period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene", said Caplovitz.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about menstrual - religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from her school scared and upset that she had first started menstruation among her friends.
There are many well - known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexually explicit messages in the media can be accused.
Boys, like girls, are also getting premature puberty.
The Caplovitz rule states that the main cause is an outbreak of constipation.
He helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001 that linked body fat to the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African - American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty before their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the model of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the full development of puberty is not as clear in them as in girls.
Other practitioners attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it is common to see facial hair and genital hair.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty", says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goraib Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children.
"It may mean talking ahead of time", Caplovitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Premature girls need to be assured that even if it is premature, it is a part of normal life.
On Wednesday, the temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Wednesday, people dressed in sweaters and went to the markets and their destination.
People have also taken a holiday on the first rains of winter.
In the morning, people were seen enjoying the sunshine.
The weather changes will also provide relief from cold and other illnesses, but after that, the day was still cloudy and the sunshine continued.
Children also went to their school wearing sweaters.
The maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department.
While 7.8 millimeters of rain was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, clouds will continue to be visible in the sky.
The big orders of jet makers are at stake from the controversy over seat width.
This month's Dubai Airshow has created a race to set the pace for fights among leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy has centered on the width of economy class seats on long-haul aircraft, not always as given by airlines but whose allocated space efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus is hoping to offer a wide seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week, but this should be decided by airlines, its main competitor Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers came when a race to sell a larger version of the twin engine of the long - range aircraft was launched from the possible orders entered after the 17-21 incident.
How is the aircraft's front compartment designed - specifically whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 - taking into account the claims of higher capacity the design of mini jumbo jets is being developed?
Boeing says it has built a 777 X that will hold 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in a designated department.
Airbus says that competing with the A350 it will take 350 people to a seat left 18 inches 9 - equal.
Airline giants often strike commercials on technical matters through advertisements in the business press.
Now, Airbus 777 X is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Dubai Airshow, which is appealing to the public further.
Recently, it has been seen that the beginning of the war of the rebellion was something like this, showing Financeiro that all three of them together in a restaurant.
John Leahy, head of Airbus sales, said "Boeing is also offering long-haul flights in short-seats from regional turbochargers".
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way planes sit hasn't changed.
According to the US Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Zombo ne defined modern long haul travel, and the century between me and the average 40- to 49-year-old American male, my weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waistline of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals are stuck with the 1950s one-seat concept when the new name "Jet Set" was a medium-sized, compact range.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an extra inch in seat width to improve sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing has disputed Airbus seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airline balances rents and amenities.
Also, research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
"It really explains what airlines need to do to be flexible and what they believe in to be successful", said Kent Craver, a Boeing cabin expert.
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from".
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about the elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect revenue.
The controversy is estimated to be at least $700 billion in trade, and competition for aircraft orders is enough to tip US and European exports in the coming decades.
A Reuters report reported for the first time in July that the seat layout is actually a battle between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent efficiency per seat in their new twin engine design of that segment leader, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300R.
Boeing 's claimed performance depends on the 777 X One with 10 compared to the original 777 with 9 designs.
The comparison is now used with the unit cost profit of 10 equal to 10.
Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger facilities in Europe says "Boeing is making it more competitive with their aircraft, with our products, to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin suggests that for the existing 777 S many passengers favor a densaur layout, which can go with a cheaper fare at the same time.
Cabin interior expert Mary Curby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network said, "The 18-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is powered by the threat of Proposition 777".
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world should also take careful measures to check out this layout competition.
While resting more, all builders are also offering low cost airlines and high density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equivalent A350 but says it is not yet sold.
But until recently, Airbus emphasized wider cabin seats on some of its jets for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers but it could distract from the 777X sales wave.
A new anti - nicotine vaccine can end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti - nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which may take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the anergic signs are positive.
"We have high hopes that this type of vaccine strategy will eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market today, but they have found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to transmit genetic information for the purpose of creating anti - nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, they prevent the need for nicotine from developing inside the smoker.
In the trial, vaccinated mice who were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the researchers say the rat who wasn't vaccinated "feel good", a sign that the nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The first tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
It required regular dosing to maintain antibody levels, but proved expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine is expected to be expensive, as it will make the liver cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, to prevent them from becoming addicted to nicotine.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not have any enjoyment of smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them to break their habit", he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the postmortem, the real cause of the tiger 's death could not be revealed.
The Forest Department is responding in a round manner to this by first appearing to describe the death of the tiger as natural.
On Thursday night, forest workers of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Pavlogarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drainage.
All the organs of the tiger 's body were safe and there were no marks of wounds or injuries.
The body of the tiger was post-mortemed by Bharat, a CTR veterinarian, and Hema Rathore, a CTABag veterinarian, in the presence of Forest Preservator Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR, Saket Badola, DFO Kahaksha Nassim, SDO GS Karki on Friday.
Sources say that the internal corpse of the tiger is being reported to be decayed during the postmortem.
This did not reveal the actual cause of death of the tiger.
The departmental officer, Golamal, continued to respond to the death of the tiger.
Nevertheless, the inner organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topical examination to confirm the poisoning.
Forest Preservation Western Circle Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can be said to be natural.
The tiger 's body has not shown any signs of poisoning.
Nevertheless, the surrounding area has been searched and the Bissra investigation has been sent to confirm the poison.
Tripodes deny being influenced by Obid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by the State Corpson Watch Dog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the policy of maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obide, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obide, who had hidden interests in the three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday further investigated whether Mr. Obadiah lobbied several state ministers for breaches of the Leases Policy Circulars, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obadiah were renewed without tender after their deadline expired in August 2005.
The allegation that Mr. Trippodi knew the secret interests of Mr. Obayid, after the evidence provided by Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, on Thursday, is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressured for the launch of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted more time.
In 2009, the lease cycle for enterprises, which Obayd earned 2.5 million dollars annually, was renewed without leasing tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported the public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr. Obayed 's request, Mr. Tripodi had urged a change in government lease policy.
Transcript of a phone call made in ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obaid's fisheries department after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. " Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation, on the matter?"
"No", Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can 't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn 't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. O'Brien.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets raided Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there must have been at least one purpose.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has airstrikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
457 foreign employees on visas can pass "validity" test
A "validity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it aims to expand a strict procedure.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to be passed on to family and friends in a covert manner.
A government discussion paper was released today, denouncing the government's gossip about foreign workers. Former Labour MP Maxine McQuaid said today that it could anger Australia 's neighbours.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreigners are coming to the end of the line" and that the loud rhetoric about "Australians get jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions are demanding a safe labour market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met with authorities about smugglers has implemented five proposed changes, while the remainder are pending.
If the "validity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to whether the registration is true in circumstances where the nominee is the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or a relative or personal partner of the relevant person.
Businessmen may need to keep track of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine - year - old son had come to Australia with him on a voyage, and after his father died on Wednesday, an adult cousin, who was on the same boat, has been hanged.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study has been announced by the British Government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 Rail project.
The works by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite Britain".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said they were "very excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of further improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, bringing the UK and its cities closer together".
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be enormous.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity of 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" withdrawal to the HS2 network.
"High speed rail is likely to be a major economic benefit to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole of the UK in terms of high speed rail", Mr Brown said.
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British Government ministers next year and to taking joint decisions on further action.
Aircraft power equipment rules will remain in force in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to US airline service companies to change their procedures so that during critical stages of flight passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment, provided that those devices remain in "Airplane" mode.
Passengers can still do this during many flights, but many people do not like being unable to access their e-books when flying and landing.
Australian airline companies are considering the decision that US airline companies will have to do a lot to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in critical phases of flight are still in effect in Australia.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in aircraft", the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations according to which airline operations companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with safety instructions given by crew members".
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but has asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome the review by CASA in the matter of permitting the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel that it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft", the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during takeoff and landing of aircraft, and we have no immediate plans to convert it".
FAA decisions apply to US alerts.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their rulebooks, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefing.
The FAA said that "after verification by airlines of the tolerability of their aircraft, it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes".
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during the landing of the aircraft.
The group also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the upper trunk during takeoff and landing.
Silver of ponbrokers because of the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold ring, ring and zumbak to pay her daughter's school fees at the ponshop at the Bendaire Shopping Centre in Singapore.
Mrs. Aamirathlinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it".
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, the same demand is in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is rising - where Valumax is trading, becoming the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Giving jewelry mortgages is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in Ms. Amithalinga's case - but it is almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
In Singapore, ponebrokers typically charge 17 percent interest per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, PONBROKERS have the advantage of not requiring credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide loans more quickly than a bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to ponshops due to the difficulties faced by families due to rising living expenses and increased domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income families are turning to ponshops to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economies.
This week, the rating agency, Standards Ang Powers, identified the rising domestic gains due mainly to rising mortgages as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratios in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of this list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slump and decline in consumer demand.
"The crucial point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes [of income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way", said Song Seng Won, an economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets as they take advantage of the opportunity to value their family jewelry.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items held in the 200 PON outlets of City-State are gold.
People are saying, "Gold feels good, let's take Grandma's gold chain and take it back next month".
Thailand's largest popshop operator, Egemony, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The mortgage business has grown so much that Valumax, the outlet operator in Bendamir and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, said Valumax Executive Director Yah Li Ching.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars earned in the listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledging not only provides a cheaper rate than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers are holding on to things they already have, and the exploitation of personal assets does not increase household debt", she says.
The social acceptance of PONbroking for short-term and secure financial assistance is increasing.
It is not that pawnbrokers are used only by financially weak persons.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, they hold gold bars or rolex watches on mortgage which can get up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all walks of life.
"This includes wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements", says Ms Yah.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.

$ 325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The Union Government has stressed that there are also strict conditions attached to a $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmania's sickening health system which will ensure that the state government cannot waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis due to the ageing population of the island state, high rates of decaying diseases, and systemic limitations.
The decision on funding over the four years was taken after consultation with the Government with the Independent MP for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has introduced an emergency rescue package which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state", Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help resolve past accumulated cases.
It also includes funds for launching walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and personal electronic health recording systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are consistent with the best practices that leading practitioners have told me to improve Tasmania's health system", Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government will face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State must maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report every month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member Commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr Wilkie said that the $325 million would not be much until "real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more viable level".
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought to the Prime Minister in early May".
"I hope that the Federal Assistance Package will prove very helpful in the direction of separating the State Re Public Health System from the crisis-affected list", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will mostly reverse the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution".
"We are here because the Labor State government has taken 430 million dollars into its health system", he told ABC TV.
You cannot consider the state government taking almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving 300 million dollars as a good news day.
Mr. Datton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of the novel by Dennis Diderot, by Gilow Nickox, has excellent production design and time frame details, but it has gone far beyond what it should have been.
Set in France in 1760, the novel tells the tragic story of a young nobleman named Susan who is sent by a member of her family to the convent.
When she rebels she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluntary victim Mother Superior, and becomes the object of sexual attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensationalism - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the storyline, it also risks becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA VC Dr. Munna Singh has decided to impose a fee on entrance to the garden due to the spread of dirt in the garden.
The government has given 15 days to repair the situation of the departments.
The Vice President on Friday morning at 10 am, with the Department of Gardens, made a brief inspection of the Deputy Director of Seed and Field and Director of Research.
During this time, he found over a dozen employees including directors in these departments dismissed from their seats.
After the scolding, he warned that if he was found absent the next time, he would cut his salary.
Dr. Naushad Khan, in charge of media at the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 would be required for a monthlong walk.
For a fee of Rs. 1 per day, people will be able to walk in the garden.
The system will work: The incoming files related to various tasks will be sent to the VC under one system.
Not every employee shall have the right to enter the office of the Vice President with his file.
The relevant officers will deliver their final report to the Vice President.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed critical equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas war material, while a violent conflict erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the location where toxic agents are believed to have been held.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war, which began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the deadline of November 1.
which the Hague - based organization had designated Damascus to destroy or "disown" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemicals and fill war materials in toxic gases.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious development aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections that exist.
Syria is believed to have at present 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The UK Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that the announcement came as the conflict escalated in the town of Saffira on Thursday, which experts believe is the location of a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which keeps track of deaths through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, were among them.
The government has said that 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military forces, 18,678 are fighters fighting for the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict that has been ongoing since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
This conflict has forced about 20 lakh people to leave the country.
Assad's military forces fought rebels in Safiira for weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people from both sides were injured, but it did not say anything explicitly.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short timeframe.
The statement to the UN working with the OPCW said its team was "now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment in Syria - destroyed".
It also said, "No further inspection activities are planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that Syria said the two centers had been "abandoned and... chemical weapons products stored there were delivered to other declared centers which have been inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safiira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
In a statement issued by the OPCW, Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmed Uzumku said, "I salute the determination and enthusiasm you have shown in completing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization".
The three-year civil war is mainly a conflict between the Assad government and its security forces, including those who have left Shiite Islam, members of the Al-Alat sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory Head Rami Abdulrahman said that a powerful explosion occurred at the Air Defense Centre in Latakia, a coastal region of Syria, on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion is not yet known.
Police have recovered from the possession of the accused fake registries, fake stamps, laptops and photocopies of fake registries.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested suspects include Rajiv Agarwal aka Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Gumar Mandie, Gurinder Singh Guggi of Kohara and Sonu of Gumar Mandie.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar 's Office (East) has escaped from the scene.
According to the police, the accused worked with the Registrar's office clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh to extract papers from the records of vacant and old land and then to buy new stamp papers and create fake registrars on them.
Not only that, but they would then disappear the real registry and upload it to the fake registry records.
After that, the accused sold the land on fake paper for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these counterfeit paperwork borrowers.
After this, the real owner of the land was a threat to the police and administration.
The accused who had prepared the fake registers were keeping a close eye on the NRIG land.
Because there is no one to look after NRIG land.
Therefore, it is easy to create and sell fake registers of these land.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused in the interrogation said that they have prepared close to 150 fake registrations so far.
According to the police, there have been previous cases of fraud and theft against Sargana Rajiv.
Outcry over conviction of planner of the Bali bombing
The relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bombings, expressing their outrage at the punishment of the planner, said that Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who ran as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in building the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years if given parole.
The 45 - year - old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including the 2000 Christmas Eve series bombing of a church in Indonesia.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could also demand that the man, known as the master bomb maker, infamously called the "destructive man", be executed.
The decision re-refreshed the painful memories of June Curtin, a Perth woman who lost her 39 - year - old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co - conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his ashes, he said that Patek should have been executed.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other rogue terrorists.
"He should be brought before the firing squad", Ms. Courtin told AAP.
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The club was dissolved shortly after 11pm on 12 October 2002, following the explosion of a bomb loaded in a van outside the Di Sari Club.
Peter Hughes, Paddy's was in the bar when a bagpack full of explosives was detonated by suicide bombers exactly 20 seconds earlier.
He went into a month - long coma as a result of the bombing and "died" three times while on life - saving equipment.
Mr Hughes says that Patek should have received the same sentence as three other members of the Jemmah Islamiah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amarogi, Mukhals and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
Keep him alive, see, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bomb blasters.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had provided evidence that the report revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He did not surrender", says Ms. Courtin.
Even today, he is not really sad to cause so many people mental anguish.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", said Ms. Courtine.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on the plane (but not on cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but not speak to their cell phones - from entering the gate to leaving the gate, under highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented will vary across airlines.
Airlines must show to the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices for their crew members to reflect the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the scheme, we can very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are expected to reach an altitude of 10,000 feet and not turn them on until authorized by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when landing the aircraft and not turn it on until the aircraft has landed completely.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully secure from electronic interference may allow their passengers to use the device when flying, landing and taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleding, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win situation for both parties", Gleding said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are bored of feeling like hall monitors.
However, surfing, email exchanges, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data via internet connection at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no interaction with friends, like online scrabble games, which are linked to the famous incident in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the airport park, and American Airlines took him off the plane when he was refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment like laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their bouncing will cause concern that another person in the cabin will be injured.
Cell phone calls during flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission has the regulatory authority for telephone calls, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing of aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkant of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is the national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation-related devices, but also because they can interfere with cell phone towers when in the air", said Rosenkar.
The Industry Advisory Committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month recommended that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D - Mo, have said that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Enforcing these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when it received reports of disruption to navigation and communication devices due to the FM radio and high technology gadgets carried by passengers at the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes to passengers for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Hoarta said that most airlines should meet eligibility criteria for overuse of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power radio transmissions than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e - readers have a very nominal transmission when a page is flipped.
But transmission is predominant when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has been among those who have advocated for reducing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded all of its Kindle e-readers into airlines and blew them up for testing of problems but found no such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed joint sentiments about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Aircraft Passenger Association, said he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports only described by the pilot in support of device interference in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to order passengers to turn off the device when landing aircraft in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
U.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Doe said we are pleased that the FAA has recognized that traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with passenger, rescue and safety.
Learning from the series of bombings in Patna, the UT Police has taken a quick response to Diwali celebrations and emergencies in view of security.
A total of 1800 soldiers will be on foot patrolling all the main places of the city, crowded markets and other places including vehicles to conduct traffic smoothly, prevent rush attacks, teach lessons to the mobs and arrest perpetrators of other attacks.
The personnel will include female police officers including PCR, Traffic Unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also check the records of duty carefully at hotels, guest houses and other places in the city including PG.
The SHO has been instructed to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
Also, the DSPs, including the Inspector, have been entrusted with the task of inspecting markets, malls and other places including VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the High Commissioners have also set additional police personnel duty in the police controls in view of the convenience of the people.
Police have asked staff of other dispensaries besides sector-16 GMSH and sector-32 GMCH management, including Director, Principal Director and DHS of the Fire Department and PGI, to maintain high alert in emergency times.
To teach the lessons to the minds, the departmental authorities have now recruited others including female police officers to duty, naming them as 'Anti Gunda Staff' led by NGOs.
The police of the anti-Gandh Staff Team will be present in crowded places including markets in plain clothes and arrest the protesters.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to install 44 noses in the inner city.
Police personnel will also be stationed at 38 NAKA points on the city borders.
The bird was released back into the wild by air transport to protect from the North Sea rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The water-rail bird was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before being resuscitated by the Scottish SPCA at their rescue centre in Eloa.
"This waterway was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was caught by high winds over the North Sea", said Colin Sedden, the center's manager.
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge in the oil rig.
He added: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help".
The water rail was well and fit before it left.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes UK jobs and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For this we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders asking them what their views were on UK business with the EU.
U-GoW took the view of 1000 business leaders representing the UK business size, areas and locations.
The results of this survey may surprise many.
We found that a large part of the business community now wants to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming more and more inactive.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than engaging in a long-term and nefarious process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualities should come back to Westminster.
The general discontent with the single market could be easily seen, with businessmen saying that the cost of Brussels regulation is far greater than the benefits of being part of the European trading area - even 40 percent of the giant businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally, and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large proportion clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were pushing for a "significant change" that would restore the UK to its lost power.
It costs a lot - the issue of treaty change for Britain and getting a better deal changed the vote in the poll, 16 percent in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey is the basis for UK businessmen to support their plan to negotiate terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate the current balance of power by making a meaningful shift in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly imperative as the Eurozone moves towards a more connected economy and fiscal union.
Priority must of course be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that this means a new focus on business for business owners and a fundamental change in the regulatory system in Brussels.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom called the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new era.
Gazprom Head said that the start of construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today a historic event has taken place: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian side of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom President Alexi Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is to Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes, officials said.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means an "eternal" end to the geopolitical risks associated with gambling with transit countries.
After the entire project is launched in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission heard.
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before the Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord was charged in 2011.
But in its statement to the Commission it said that it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the Commission was informed.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of Y.M.C.A. was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which Y.M.C.A. Caringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children in his care in the year 1991.
Advocate Gail Fernes, assistant to the Commission, said that he was aware of the first case but not the second.
He also acknowledged that the statement by YMCA to the Commission that "YMCA has been externally investigated and has found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also incorrect.
The Commission has evidence that YMCA was notified and it got the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA for 21 years, admitted that the appointment of Lord has failed to manage "including myself", and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their responsibilities related to reporting child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two-year tenure at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, which led to employees not reporting a child protection violation by Lord.
The staff gave evidence of the violation, including Lord spending time alone with the children, babysitting them privately, hugging them, telling them he loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in Lord's custody and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about Lord's conduct, testified that YMCA Caringbah Children's Service Manager Jackie Barnat, who supervised Lord, was "very threatening and hard to find most of the time".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable with reporting above their manager.
He said that his friendship with Lord had misled his decision to inform him.
Mr Hare said that he had provided his vision to the YMCA NSW Congregation that the text from the "Jonathan Lord Event" was for the organization to "not inform".
Mr Hare said that the decision to have the confidentiality agreement signed by the staff was made by Liam Whitley, General Manager of Children's Services, YMCA, immediately after the allegations were made.
He said that this was intended to avoid mixing evidence, but it was not executed "extremely discouragingly" and correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that the YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation during Jonathan Lord 's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, traineeship, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said he would like to have a chance to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom again - but he believes there is no possibility of a comeback.
In an interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his remarks to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and Middle East peacekeepers group.
When asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's post, Mr Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard newspaper in London as saying: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely, so"...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to show off the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet in school and a few months away from taking her first step, this little boy and his pet Tattoo Taffy of Shetland easily completed three stages and won the top prize - she outran her 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Roadry, near Cardiff, the indistinguishable pair - which is Sk - were highly praised for their looks, behaviour and style.
In front of the men and women wearing the beautiful bowler hat, he threw his flat hat at a slight angle and circled his two - year - old toffee around the ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control which is far beyond his age.
And Toffy got the highest score for her looks and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has practiced with this Shetland tattoo daily ever since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffey are a great couple".
They had to face challenges from all the candidates, but both won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second time he had competed with Toffey, and we are all very happy about his win.
The most unique in this theatre, he was so amazing that everyone wanted to take a photo with him.
This little boy from the village of Nantigloo near Ab Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells who has been showing horses for over 10 years.
"The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping", said Mrs. Howells.
He was running on the sand all over the theater, and despite his small appearance, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a wild animal lover - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has raised two chickens to care for.
The way he started, he'll be at the best horse show of the year long ago - and I'm sure he'll do great.
"Fenton is only three years old, but he can control his tail", said a spokesman for the annual horse show.
They are a very good couple.
The judges scored based on the manner of performance of Fenton and Toffey and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Tattus and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffey were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped her, she really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argued would be "rehabilitated"
A Chinese newspaper that had appealed on the front page for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou newspaper New Express had offered a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But afterwards Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write a bogus story about a state-owned company.
The regulator said that New Express now has to go through "complete reform".
The order for "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"An initial investigation revealed that New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company ZoomLoyne in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of the New Express was chaotic".
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter".
It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to complete a reform of the New Express, suggesting that the New Express investigate those responsible for it and revise the leadership team of the New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Jumloon.
After his ban, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came on state television, admitting to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"I have damaged ZoomLoyne as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people in this case", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen apologized, New Express issued a front page apology, saying it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high profile suspects have admitted to TV broadcast fault.
Experts say that from time to time, forced confessions are made, despite a law in the second half of this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to confess to himself.
Shri Hanuman Chalisa, National Chairman of Anti-Terrorist Front Maninderjit Singh Bitta will be presenting the text of Shri Hanuman Chalisa with 10,000 children at the lecture of Shri Hanuman Chalisa on 23 November, to be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass by the Hindu Justice Bench.
This information was given to the crowd by Shri Hindu Justice Bench Chief Spokesperson Praveen Dung and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Benga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma after inviting them to read the text of Hanuman Chalisa.
He praised the efforts of Shri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with the Sanaathan culture.
He said that religious education including secular education is also essential for the unity and integrity of the country.
A railroad was found in the U.S.-Mexico Drug Tunnel.
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described the four - foot - by three - foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the same height as six football pitches, connecting the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said it was closed before any drugs passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel search.
Three persons, who were reported by authorities to have acted as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution purposes.
If convicted, they could be sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground sewerage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route to be discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Central Mexican marijuana crop in October, posing a challenge to drug mafia groups who are able to quickly get the product to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a roughly 700-yard track equipped with rail tracks that stretched from a house mill in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
Meanwhile, Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat for the Assembly constituency has submitted the nomination.
A total of 7 candidates, including one and two independent candidates from the National People 's Party, besides the BJP and Congress, submitted nominations on Thursday.
Rajsharan Bhagat, a BJP candidate for Assembly constituency 12-Jashpur, submitted the nomination letter with his constituent Nareshde to the returning officer on Thursday, the seventh day of filing the nominations starting on 25th October for the second phase of the polling on 19th November following the issuance of the Election Commission notification.
Meanwhile, Indian National Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat has submitted his nomination to the returning officer along with his founder Ajay Kumar.
BJP candidate for constituency 13- Kunkuri Rohit Kumar Sai, independent candidate for his constituency Mohnram and Kunkuri Assembly Dr. Flourchand Kujur, has filed a letter of inquiry with his ten constituents, Mrs. Apolina Khalkh, Rubene Kerketta, Sukhdev Sai Nag, Hemant Kujur, Shannaram Bhagat, Walter Kujur, Vikas Kumar Jindal, Shri Gupta, Murali Lal Agarwal and Mrs. Sushila Kujur.

British police sent Assange an extradition notice
The British police sent an extradition notice today to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "self-surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, adding that if he failed to do so he would be personally responsible for his arrest.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden on sexual offences charges, and his options under British law expired when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said that Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose".
He is in breach of the terms of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-privacy website WikiLeaks will lead to him being extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
A £1,000 fine for driving at 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
On the driver, a £1,000 fine is imposed for driving at 130 mph (210 km/h) with hot drinks between the legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes-Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a take-away drink from his legs.
Howie has pleaded guilty to careless driving in Colchester Magistrates Court.
Seven points were added to his licence, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners will end London 's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for houses worth over £2 million, and for persons who prefer to have a house in a company rather than a single person.
The stamp duty on residential property in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in tax year 2012/13 was £708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.
"After the increase in stamp duty on high value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that there is a lower tax on high value property than is appropriate, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated Council tax system.
He added that "but this move may make some foreign investors reluctant to sell to silent and current owners in London".
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market by value in affluent South West London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Saviles' research, central London's prices continued to rise regularly at 5.6 percent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the rising "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) boomed.
Scientists have further highlighted the connection between the dog 's tail movements and his mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (in relation to dogs), while restless dogs move their tail more to the left mainly.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and react to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions", explains Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist professor at the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that in dogs, like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left hand movements and opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-way twists by other dogs, researchers watched other dogs' movies.
They measured the heartbeat of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take us long to understand why their curves move sometimes one way and sometimes the other.
"We introduced dogs with dog films - in a realistic version or in a shots to deal with other confusing issues", said Professor Wellertigra, "and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more to the left or right".
When the animals saw a sentimental dog moving its tail to the right (in the dog 's eyes), they were completely at ease.
But when he saw the tail shifting mainly to the left (again from the dog 's point of view), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Professor Wellertigra, he does not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not about.
He said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they keep moving their tail to one side, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience".
The researchers say that these findings can provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better information about the emotions of animals.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Contrary to an Italian study - when a robot dog's tail was moved to the right rather than the left, dogs were more likely to get close to it than to be restless".
He said that the difference was because in various studies dogs in movies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs.
He clarified that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help in this.
"While there is ample evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be gained - and in this case dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it probably won't take us long to understand why their curves sometimes move one way and sometimes the other.
The Arctic Monkeys postponed the Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner 's illness
The rock bank Arctic Monkeys has postponed Gig in Glasgow after suffering from a throat infection from its lead singer.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday.

The band's announcement came as they were forced to postpone gigs in the same way at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: After the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight after medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was found to have throat diarrhea, and he is sadly unable to perform".
The show will now be on November 20 at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on February 22 for the first time in his tenure.
Cardinals, the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, are only below the Pope, and they elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint a first group of his individuals, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals in total.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - he falls into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of promoting the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the Papal Assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the February papal council in advance, so as to facilitate planning other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that the Pope usually declares as many cardinals as the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, and as many as he wishes of cardinals over the age of 80.
Valero said next year's papal conclave will be important, as it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes, from the rest of the world, also nominate cardinals to restore balance.
Forty percent of South Americans are Roman Catholics, but very few of them are Cardinals.
The Council of Cardinals, by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways of reforming the Church - will also be the first cardinals elected after its formation.
Before that, the Pope made all decisions on his own.
"Francis has now chosen these eight cardinals to assist him", Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that the pope usually gives the bishop of large places the rank of cardinal, but Francis was "completely surprising - so we don't know whose name they will declare".
GM recalled pickup trucks in the US to fix the seatback
According to a statement from U.S. Auto Safety Regulators on Friday, General Motors Co., Ltd. has recalled approximately 19,000 trucks to rectify a deficiency in hand-held rotating seatbacks in its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a deficiency in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, head restraint.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not be able to properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM trucks began shipping in June and marks the most significant launch for a top U.S. automaker since the 2009 bankruptcy renovation.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown which had hampered the growth of auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon bounced 1.4 percent.
The cry of disappointment of Obama's voters
I voted twice for Obama, hoping for change.
He says that the policy of blocking the GOP has hampered Obama's great efforts.
The Obamacare website's troubles, drone attacks, cannot be excused by the policy of blockade.
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will give me encouragement and hope during my second year of medical school.
It is called "The Courage to Win", and it commemorates Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get off my patients' prescriptions at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics had inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The election proved to be one - way, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
Tears of joy were in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents kept every newspaper they could find.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like coming back from a dream world.
It is hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
After I first went to vote, things really changed.
Simply put, I could not imagine any of this.
I credit Obama with a lot of accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of biased opposition has hampered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reforms, public options for healthcare, the closure of the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I have defended myself in front of colleagues and colleagues for the Obama administration, I have no answers to give them.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican opposition policy is not a response to foreign leaders' espionage, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor to prosecution of those exposing government misconduct.
It cannot explain the cause of the assassination of American citizen Anwar El Awalaki without a trial, nor the limits of public funds and spending that diminish during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don't know if I expected that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government could reject the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public debate.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly self - elected by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I thought a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to go back to 2008 through that book.
I remember his lost promises.
This week I was reading a section of the book that described how Clinton had suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they need to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
He said, "I want my mojo back".
We must remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbott 's interest in the paternity leave scheme is a conflict of interest
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with the Paternity Leave Scheme as his daughters can get pregnant, and benefit from it.
The mining master, who is in dispute over the payment of the $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
"They may have a significant conflict of interest in the matter of paternity leave given, because if any of their daughters become pregnant they will have a direct interest whether or not they get leave", said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of Fairfax 's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Palmer demanded a revival of the election count to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Auth, Frances and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we vote?
"We should have a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where we fill our votes in the computer, vote immediately, and we get the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Because if someone doesn't like it, can they delete it?
Using a pencil seems absurd in this day and age.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies include building an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and he took his new task "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
"We need no other award than the award of history that we can serve the community at this critical time", he said.
This caused the plaintiffs to be troubled.
Addressing the meeting held on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his strong outrage at the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said the rapidly increasing attacks on lawyers and their families show that the perpetrators have become fearless.
They are no longer afraid of the police and the administrative system.
Referring to recent incidents in different places, he said that when advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily imagined.
RBS suspended two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, two people who were experts in the case have received this information, another sign that the global investigation by regulators into suspicious currency market manipulation is moving fast.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigation into the world's largest financial market with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended as the investigation of the case, which appears to be a repeat of the Libor Interbank Loan Manipulation scandal, proceeds.
The Bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the Bank has received a request for notification from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other regulators".
Last month, experts in the case had said that RBS had sent the records of emails and instant messages received from the former trader to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been dismissed from his current position as the European Head of Forex Spot Trading at JP Morgan.
The head of European Spot Trading City, Rohn Ramchandani, had gone on holiday last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the case reported that Mr. Usher 's instant messaging group includes Barclays and Citigroup bankers.
UBS said it had taken action against some of its employees this week after being informed by Swiss regulator, FINMA, that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, FINMA, Competition Authority of Switzerland, VCO, FCA, Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of misconduct against bankers to cause favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the case said.
Banks are closely examining several years of instant messaging and emails to find clues of wrongdoing.
The news about the investigation has stirred up confusion among traders in the sector who have been among the top earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years but are facing a challenge this year as low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for bookmakers.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous volume of foreign exchange buying and selling, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced the trader would be discharged from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London this week, which had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said "We believe the trader acted alone, and he has been controlled".
Students studying other courses including on-campus technical and management will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The university chancellor has written to the governor for permission to hold the election.

More than 6,000 students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise the franchise for the first time.
V.C. Prof. Ashok Kumar said that permission has been sought from the Governor to hold elections in the university.
The date of election will be announced as soon as the permission is obtained.
He said that it is the responsibility of the College Management to elect other colleges.
Many college managers do not want student union elections on their campus.
At the same time, elections are not being held due to lack of unity among the students.
The Council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, department coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
The lack of clarity in the college view on the student union election is also causing problems.
People have bought a lot of gold and silver from the pottery to the capital at Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the previous year.
The jewellery shops in Shimla were crowded with longs.
There was also a large crowd in the pottery shops from the Lower Market to the Mall Road.
Although this year inflation was on such items, people were still not hesitant to shop at the auspicious moment.
The happy hour for shopping on Friday was from 7:52 to 10:12 am and 1:56 to 3:37 pm and 6:17 to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the three mourning, crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla rushed for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Market, there was no place for people to stand.
The crowd was similar in every small and large shop.
In such a situation, shopping on the Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Krishna side 's Trayodashi Dhantrayodashi of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law in the name of Barack Obama constitutional.
By a vote of 5-4 the judges ruled in favour of the separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase or pay health insurance before the year 2014 - that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose tax.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thoss, Elliott and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law, and said that the condition of the Health Care Act that the States increase Medicaid eligibility or they lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, as well as the National Federation of Independent Business to stop the law.
During the inaugural session of 2012, the bill was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including project nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that without money our work cannot go on.
Money is one of the greatest necessities for survival, but it is not in our interest to take it for granted.
We celebrate the Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month on Dhanteras.
Dhanteras is worshipped as Kuber, the god of wealth and Yamamaraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
The good and the bad are our feelings towards money.
There can be no more valuable thing than the wealth that has served the welfare of mankind, but the wealth that has caused the ego has no meaning.
We should make money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of it must be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to make money in an uncalculated way, or in a yen-ken manner, destroys our conscience and personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in mind.
A portion of the money you give can also be the basis of one 's livelihood.
We should all think about the many people in society who are living in dire poverty.
In fact, the masculinities of life have given equal importance to meaning, religion, work and salvation.
All people wish for wealth and success and according to their masculinity they also get wealth and success.
The same wealth is durable with which honour is associated.
No criminal, however rich, can consume it properly or benefit anyone else.
Do not hate someone who has wealth.
The real rich are those who make the way for wealth to flow in the hands of the many.
No one can use money more effectively than creating jobs for others.
Another thing is that money is not just currency.
It is also in the form of your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to become the owner of this wealth.

According to sources, while bringing Ujjar Ahmed to court, the NIA said that Ujjar Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Indian Mujahideen members Imtiaz Ansari and Haider, the main accused of the Patna serial bombings.
Ahmed had introduced many other terrorists to Ansari.
Through interrogation of Ahmed, the NIA also wants to arrest other accused in the case.
The search for the bomb - making material and the terrorists who made it is still pending.

STF has found a malfunction in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
About 125 of these students had taken admission to medical colleges.
Admission of these students can now be cancelled.
Following the disclosure of STF, the Department of Medical Education has started a rally to cancel admission of these students.
The department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to be received from STF.
The list will be sent to the Vampam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also talking about seeking legal advice in this matter.
The departmental officials say that the year of admission for students in 2012 is one year and therefore it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
The matter is now confined to STF investigation and the medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything.
The business operator Tarun Pitore says that if the STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be immediately cancelled.
The Director of Medical Education Dr. Nirbhaai Srivastava said that the students have not even refused to cancel their admission if they are found to be correct to have fake admission.
According to STF officials, fake students who were enrolled in PMT of the year 2012 are being examined.
After the examination, the list of suspected students will be handed over to the Vampam.
It is worth mentioning that Wampaman had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students who took the PMT exam in 2013.

If the new government continues to pursue a policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration after the general election, the stores in half a dozen states will not get kerosene.
The states that are to ban the sale of kerosene include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, there are also plans to close the sale of kerosene in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states in the North East.
According to the Ministry of Petroleum sources, the decision to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the States will be made on two grounds.
The first is the rapid connection of electricity in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being discontinued in the states where most rural households have been given gas connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made solid preparations for this.
The sale of PDS kerosene has already been closed in Delhi since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been significantly reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The Punjab quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to 1 lakh kg.
The Kerosene quota of Haryana was reduced by about 40 per cent of the allocation of 70 per cent in Uttarakhand.
Despite this cut, there has been no report of kerosene shortages from these states.
The ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene has been used for blending.
The difference in price of PDS petrol and diesel is Rs 37 at this time.
This encourages mixers.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in open market.
Oil companies are currently losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy in the year 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.
The accused used to fake the purchase and sale of shares by opening investors ' accounts in the name of trading firm.
Possibly: This is the first such disclosure in the state to reveal the fraud of crores of rupees.
The gang leader has not been reached by the police but seven people have been detained by the police, including the accused who watched his work in the state.
The gang operated a fake commodity market called MetaTrader 5.
The company's shareholders used to take cash from investors and create a fake ID on a fake software.
It showed the accused shares bought by investors when trading.
It would even tell which shares were bought at what price.
There was no actual purchase of shares or transaction for it, as no defect account was opened for investors and shares were falsely shown on this fake software.
Police are speculating that hundreds of people have joined the gang.
Between two and five lakh rupees were invested in the name of making a profit from each investor.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by a cyber cell from Jodhpur, while six other associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Sale Ashok Dubale, any stock trading company must be affiliated with the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this the company can get the investors to trade shares through it.
Then the investor 's DeMate account is opened to buy and sell shares for him, but this company called MetaTrader 5 was neither affiliated with any exchange nor did it conduct stock trading.
The company bought the server for itself on 24 September 2012 by trading under the name Wintrade.
Since then, people have been deceived by this company in the name of investments.
Eight Indore businessmen have come forward complaining in the cyber sale.
Even after selling his purchased shares for profit, the amount was not transferred to the account.
He started to demand profit from the shareholders of the company.
Investors are even saying that the fake ID they were given was always displaying the price of the shares they bought at a low price.
The price was determined by the accused at his level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, Mapra and Maharashtra.

BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanth Mangeshkar Hospital, while addressing an election gathering on Friday, he lashed out at Congress.
On the occasion, Modi said, "In many states and centers of the country, once there was a coalition government, once there was a Congress government, sometimes there was a Communist government, sometimes there was a BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What party did.
If the comparative results are obtained, the country will not have to ask whether the BJP should come to power.
Wherever the BJP has formed a government, there has been an effort to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country has witnessed inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food twice.
But when the Congress or its backed government came into being, the poor man was not fortunate enough to get a full meal.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is answering what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media of our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even answer the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal, saying, "These days Modi is being questioned. In 2014 when the people bless the BJP, he will present his work to the people every year.
In a democracy, the ruler should sit, not the servant in Delhi.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congressional friends keep dropping balloons on the day of the visit.
Congressional friends, we have passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the exam.
The Nortel patent case is being sued by Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a number of patent lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, which it overtaken in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
An association called Rockstar, which bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said that the patents also include technology that combines internet search terms with consistent advertising terms, which is a key part of Google 's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is a tough competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had placed an initial bid of $900 million for Northtel patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Northtel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons being that Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment said that "even though Google has lost its bid to acquire patents-in-suit, it has violated and continues to violate".
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is gross.
Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory day has barely ended the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office in front of 18 judges in black robes in his courtroom on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown live on national television, Morsi said, "We are aspiring for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic".
The radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an outlawed organization since its founding and has been targeted by previous governments, said Morsi, 60, a U.S.-trained engineer for the party, "Today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers secured the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President apart from the President's pomp and circumstance, and traffic was also temporarily blocked so that their motorcade could exit the generally busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi, who was ridiculed as the Brotherhood's non-charismatic "hollow tire", gained a lot of personal standing after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against dictatorship Mubarak.
In a blue business suit and red tie, Morsi took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation".
Morsi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural address.
The military band played the national anthem and officially welcomed him while he stood in the posture of caution.
Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi, the military ruler, was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture hall at the main university there welcomed him with the slogan "The army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and swore to the ousted leader last year to withdraw the presidential powers stripped of his position by the military council.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than traditionally taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi 's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatically popular currencies.

Meanwhile, a key committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill restricting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust that has been hurt by the disclosure of mass phone tapes.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also raided the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Power Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] on NSA by 4 votes to 11.
The bill outlines several restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone taping under the US Patriot Act.
The use of data by knowingly collecting unauthorized data under FISA is considered a crime and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
The bill will become law after it passes both Houses of Representatives and Senate of Congress.
Chairperson of the committee and Senator Diane Festin said that the NSA's program of recording phones is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.
But even so, more transparency must be brought to this.
Not only that, but the protection of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angry at the revelation of the NSA's Internet monitoring program, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome the proposal of the MPs to curb NSA's large-scale phone recording.
It is worth mentioning that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden have removed the veil from the NSA's actions.
The international community has been outraged after the NSA revealed the monitoring of telephone conversations of heads of state of 35 countries including Germany and France.

A recent media report said that NSA had leaked information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this based on documents gathered from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which it ran in conjunction with its British counterpart, GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data from the massive fiber optic cable network of Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 as saying that over 18 crore documents were collected in just three days of the program's inception.
These include emails, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, running the program outside the US was easier for the NSA, as such campaigns in the US require court orders.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying: "As far as I know, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for espionage by the German Chancellor.

Schools have decided to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
To encourage more reading, the exam will also include "Not seen text".
A joint English Literature and Language course will be terminated.
From the year 2015 students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and will have a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two subjects to revolutionize.
It will also change other major themes in the coming year.
In a separate step, the examination will showcase changes in the structure of GCSEs with regulatory off-cruel, new grading system, and reduced course.
Speaking in the heat, Education Secretary Michael Gove had said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our own examination system to restore people's confidence", he said that GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - less than 3 hours a week during the session than in most countries.
Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours per year, compared to an average of 138 hours in Singapore, according to the comparison.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the combination of comprehensive mathematics with the more weighted subjects in the GCSE - League table was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.

Surrounded by opposition questions at the rail gate, Bhansal put the opposition in a position saying that he had not looked at anyone 's wife in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised to find out where the woman's story came from.
Perhaps Bansal was pointing to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to complain to a woman behind him during the last parliamentary election which was unsuccessful.
In an interview with reporters, Bansal said that he had been questioned by the CBI in connection with the rail bribery.
If they were called as witnesses in the case, would they be called after a full investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scandal he is talking about.
If this is their sin, they will continue to commit this sin.
He said that although the Corporation had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he asked the opposition to speak for itself.
He said that for the sake of telling about development works, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development works.

He also said about his speech that he has no other feelings in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled with determination.
The Chief Minister also had the same look on his face that he took Singh 's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the concentration camp and protect them from alleged harassment of officers.
However, he also said that he was also prepared to be dismissed from the Cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, there is a fresh perspective on the employment of workers in government posts after the opinion has emerged in the reflection camp.
At the camp, Pradesh JDU Chairman Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers to the 20 committee would be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now review the list himself at his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs - MPs has been taken in making the list.
The list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers if necessary.
The common accusation of MLAs - MPs is that their opinions were not taken into account in the list of nominations.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list while many important activists active since the days of the Equality Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, others make their lives ideal through their hard work and people are inspired by them.
Among such personalities, a name also comes to S. Dhirubhai Ambani.
The third son of the late Hirachand Gowardhandas Ambani, a teacher at a school in Chhorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932.
Thiruvai was the third of five siblings.
The family's five children include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to quit his studies after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the household financially from childhood.
At this time, they were setting up a shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited by the number of tourists coming here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai 's first job, he arrived in the Yemeni city of Aden in 1949 at the age of 17 on a ship called Kabota.
His elder brother, Ramani Lal, had arranged for him here, so he had no problem finding work abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai 's mind.
So in 1954 he returned to his homeland.
In 1955, he arrived in Mumbai to try his luck with 500 rupees in his pocket.
And that is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took a step that never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on 6 July 2002.
At this time he owned Rs 62,000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his Sultanate.
Like his father, these two brothers are also known internationally.
Who doesn 't know the Ambani family today ?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party has reportedly been removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is noted that Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on the ticket of the PDP from Shopian, was also a member of his cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Saeed was the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have had a safety net since 1996.
I live in Shopi, which is called the fortress of terrorists.
A CRPF security team was stationed at my house under the supervision of Sub Inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Wednesday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP while the security team was leaving my house.
But instead of restoring security, he said he would investigate the matter.
However, in this context, when contacted by Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Meer, he denied the information about the matter, saying that it is a sensitive matter.
I will examine myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
The head of the state Congress, Prof. Safudeen Soz said that there is nothing like this in my knowledge.
If the security of Hassan Khan is compromised, it is very serious.
I am in Jammu right now and I will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Instead, contrary to Modi's claims, during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004) when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister, there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182m high 'Statue of Unity' statue of Sardar Patel in Kewadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, 'Before this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of the birth anniversaries of Sardar Patel.
While records from DAVP indicate that UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12, and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari said that the BJP PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA had not been able to bring any advertisements on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is significantly less than the amount spent on the birthdays and anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print ads.
When asked about this difference, Manish Tiwari said, 'It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of an ad depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year etc.
The fact is that it shows our dedication, which those who oppose have been unwittingly trying to take over the legacy of a great leader.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, Narendra Modi's second visit to Patna has seen strong security measures in all directions.
Police thoroughly searched the route of Modi's visit and meeting places.
The people who come to the meetings will be monitored by the police.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will keep an eye on security.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised about BJP's bone-calling journey to the dead in the Patna blast.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP has been engaged in corrupting the environment.
Moving through the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well, delivering free health care to rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or by mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or anyone else in the top 10 to be CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had watched his sick father go to the hospital, unconscious and unconscious, not properly equipped to help him.
Jaimel Well was injured in a car accident near Yunde, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
Initially, he had only a broken arm, but an infection spread to his brain, and he developed a blood clot that affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon", says Georges Well.
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Weil kept going around crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and getting whatever treatment he could.
Well said, "It's not easy".
You leave your house at 5 am with the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but this is not the case.
There are many patients there.
Some people may be in the throes of death while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Weil 's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is one physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many Cameroonians cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the healthcare spending in the country is in the private sector.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty".
Being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vale was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a physician himself, and began working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yunde.
He started the non-profit organisation EscrowWeam, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in vans, tie up medical supplies from the rooftops and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck doesn't even come with them.
More than once they have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they are truly honored with heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is truly a cause for celebration, and well - with its great smile and endless energy - it brings joy.
The next morning his team starts to meet hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip", said Well.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a bachelorette, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group generator publishes the operating room and sanitation equipment, and Vail and his volunteers work up early on Sunday morning.
It is a slow pace, but village musicians usually help keep the troupe motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep us going", said Vail.
On Sundays, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes doctors from Cameroon and foreign medical students - has performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that getting free hernia surgery would enable him to return to work.
The man said, "It will change the future of me and my family".
Apart from running a weekend clinic and working as a hospital surgeon, Vale also works in private medical clinic around Yunde at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is done through private donations.
"I don't know when they're asleep", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Well group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to raise money for their organization to keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they can never get in their own country.
"In the surgical field in which we help Dr. Well to hold tools or clean blood stains, we have been able to gain experimental experience", said O'Malley.
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never have the opportunity to do this.
Volunteer students usually spend on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after arriving at the Yunde, they are well paid for their stay and travel and instructions.
"There is no doubt they are heroes", says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same workload, not difficulty.
Helping others to live happy lives, fulfilling a promise to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I am very happy doing this", says Well.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I 'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

You may not be sure, but it's true.
Not only that, Mission Road has been named after Anjali Kumari, the Chairman of the Nagar Council.
In fact, Jharkhand Vikas Youth Front has named it to express its displeasure with some of the bad streets in the city.
The event was led by the Union Secretary of Jhammo, Satchidandanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You look at the speeches of Congress or affiliated leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done".
"Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media", he said.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Obviously Modi was responding to Sibbal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to them to avoid questions from journalists.
Sibal also challenged Modi to argue face to face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year", he said.
Congress has given all the old MLAs the ticket again.

The Adhanas have been asked to take over the Pradesh office and visit anywhere in the Pradesh if necessary.
The organisation is left alone by the election of several officials including the state president Ramsevak Pakra and the Chief Minister Shivarathan Sharma.
This has given worship a vital responsibility.
RDA Chairman Sunil Soni, who was the contender from the northern seat, has been given the responsibility of running the Raipur South seat.
Another claimant Municipal Corporation Chairman Sanjay Srishvastav has been placed on the Provincial Welcome Committee.
They will help to welcome, enter and leave the star - promoting national leaders of the party.

Obama's health care proposal withdrawn
Amid a flurry of criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew his often-repeated misleading promise that "you can continue with your health plan if you like it".
As well as receiving cancellation notices from their providers by millions, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
"Many people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue to have it", he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing the repeal of what he calls a "news rush", Obama has graciously bought new coverage on the market from U.S. citizens who receive this information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much money or a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaper than the proposed.
"You'll get a better deal", they said.
The administration has said that it should not be a surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better than this".
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
"I am as disappointed and angry as anyone else", he said.
I want to regain your trust.
After a sharp argument with the Republican, Sebelius angrily said this sentence to a colleague sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday, which was caught by a Mike.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily relinquished government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.
The case of a ransom of Rs. 2 lakh was revealed from the merchant.
The daughter has been threatened with picking up if she does not pay the money.
The case registered at Hudkeswar Station is being tried to solve with the help of the Cyber Crime Cell.
The electronics shop is owned by Narendra Bahar, a resident of Ayodhya.
Between 25 and 29th, someone made a call on his mobile from different mobile numbers.
The caller demanded Rs 2 lakh as ransom.
If he refuses, Narendra is threatened with death or with his daughter.
Narendra did not take the threat seriously at first, but when the threats began to increase and the matter came to his daughter, who was studying in class XII, he became disturbed.
Family members are in fear.
The complaint was made on Thursday.
The suspects have not been identified yet.
Given the seriousness of the case, the help of the Cyber Crime Cell is being sought.
Apart from this, MP Badal had also given instructions to the authorities on the spot to listen to the difficulties of the people in the villages of Bhagyvandra, Bander Patti, Laleana, Jajal, Fullookhari, Gatwali and Malkana by engaging in harmonious philosophy.
The MP also issued grants for the development of villages.
He ordered the Panchayats to make proper use of the grants issued for the development of villages to provide facilities to the villagers. He reviewed the current arrangements for the purchase of rice in the village of Bhagyvandra.
He gave one sewing machine, plants and certificates to 15 girls who had received sewing training.
During this period, 400 Congressmen and PPPs in the village of Bhagyvandra, 35 Congressmen and PPPs in Laleana and 71 families in the village of Jal joined the Shiromani Akali Dal except Congress and PPP.
The Minister said that the Punjab farmers are being insulted in the mandis because of the criteria set by the Centre for the purchase of rice, while the Centre has always been biased towards the Punjab farmer.
He was accompanied by D.C. K.K. Yadav, S.S.P. Ravcharan Singh Bharad, ADC D Sonali Giri, ADC Rajiv Parashar, SDM Shruti Sharma, Talwandi Sabo area Inchharge Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, administrative officers and Akali leaders from various departments.
This has led to a decrease in the number of cases of violation of the Code of Conduct.
Since the election code of conduct came into force on 4 October, 313 cases against various political parties have been registered till 21 October.
There were only 31 cases from October 22 to 27.
With the enactment of the Electoral Code of Conduct, cases of violation were also beginning to arise.
In the early days, there were many complaints, but there has been a decline.
It is reported that in the early days, there were many complaints against political parties due to the lack of complete knowledge about the code of conduct.
There are fewer complaints now due to the Election Commission's awareness of political parties and taking lessons from the case.
Many parties were campaigning as before without information, but when action was taken against them they stopped it.
Political parties are following this with knowledge of the electoral code of conduct.
This also reduces the number of violations.
ADA has sent a proposal to the Government in this regard which is soon to be sealed.
This historic city, surrounded on three sides by the Ganges and Yamuna, no longer has a plot on which the ADA could make any major housing plan.
In this way, he has now decided to plan the housing from Zhongsi to the east, from Fafamu to the north and from Naini to the south.
A meeting chaired by District Magistrate Rajshekhar was held to give a comprehensive outline of the plan.
ADA has conceived of incorporating two hundred revenue villages of Fularpur, Sorawan and Karchna.
Once within the ADA's limits, the Chak and Bharad block will be eliminated.
Half of the Kaudihar block will also be merged into the ADA.
According to ADA Secretary Amarnath Upadhyay, a proposal has been sent to the Government.
The ADA wants to take the boundaries of these Gram Panchayats under its jurisdiction for planning, which will be started soon.
If this happens, the rising prices of buildings in the city will be reduced.
At the same time, housing will be easily available to the common people.
Residential palaces will soon be built in this new area on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

The human population has exceeded 7 billion.
If the population growth continues like this, soon there will be a time when it will be difficult to raise funds for every hungry person.
Experts say that in the near future, humans will have no choice but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from McGill University in Montreal won the Halt Award for a unique project this year.
He has been awarded the prize for making protein-rich flour from insect larvae.
As a prize money, he has been given a grant of $1 million to further his research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, the group's chief student researcher, Mohammad Ashor, said that his team will now be experimenting with locusts for food.
This report provides detailed information on edible insects.

This time, Asaram, who is in judicial custody at Central Prison for alleged sexual assault of a minor student, will be held in Diwali jail.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused of raping a girl from Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai is running away from the police.
And therefore, now an arrest warrant has been issued against him by Gujarat Police.
There are also reports from Ahmedabad that the trustees of Asaram have also started to step aside from the Asaram.
Apart from this, action is now being taken on Ashrams in Asaram which are constructed illegally or on government land.
As we have already told you, Asaram has more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son are being charged with various offences.
Yet the superstition of many of his devotees is not over.
Asaram has a similar dominance not only in India but also in the United States.
Asaram is in prison here in India and devotees are getting away from him, but not at all in America.
In the Ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still visiting the Ashram as before.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that U.S. espionage "has gone too far inappropriately".
John Kerry has indicated that the U.S.'s defensive attitude toward its surveillance program has been softened by unexpectedly admitting that its espionage sometimes "goes inappropriately far".
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty along with Barack Obama of being on "automatic pilot" as a rebellious manifestation towards Edward Snowden, the NSA's spying spokesman.
This disclosure has caused the U.S. government to have diplomatic upheavals in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in the government were actually aware of some of the things that happened with the autopilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had the potential.
They have become the first senior members of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has exceeded its limits, but insist that no one's rights have been abused.
"In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately", he said.
And the President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry stressed that however, the NSA was working for good purposes, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is radical extremism in the world committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you can stop it before it happens?
We have actually saved the plane from falling, buildings falling, and people being killed because we were able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and will try to convince European countries of the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of their involvement in anti-terrorist organizations being blocked by the National Security Agency due to a lack of surveillance.
Murphy, the first elected Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that European countries stand with us in our counterterrorism efforts".
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
Reports of NSA recording millions of phone conversations from Europe have drawn bitterness in relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely accurate, and suggested a misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored cell phones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on Allied countries, calling it necessary and saying that it is common for both sides to do so.
Amid the riots, Murphy said that his office was arranging for a congressional visit that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said that work on the itinerary is still being done.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "impractical relationships" had to be sacrificed.
He said that European leaders would have to be honest with their people, and with their spy programs that have been used for years.
"While we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they too need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Carey is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address the dilemma about US surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of board changes has begun in municipalities.
Recently, the Congress - led board of councillors in the Saithiya Municipality of Veerbhum district converted Trunmool to board due to a change of party.
The change was due to the involvement of most Congress councillors, including the Municipal Chairman, in the Trun Maul.
Not only the Congress but also some MPs from the Makpa, Bhakpa and Forward Bloc have also put down the Trinamool.
The Trinamool Congress Secretary General Mukul Rai considers this a good sign for the party.
He said that 10 parishes of Congress including the Chairman of the Sanithiya Municipality, Virendra Parikh and Congress leader, Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some leftist councillors, including the MACPA, have also taken up the banner of Trinamool.
All have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and the Sanithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool as per the number force.
Shri Rai also claims that the outline of the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is agreed by all.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, Makpa, Bhakpa, and Forward Block are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The takeover of Trinamool on the Municipal Board is being considered important in political circles due to the change of Congress councillors in the Sanithiya Municipality ahead of the November 22 five municipal elections.
The former left - wing Haldia and Nadiya are examples of Trinamool 's occupation of the Congress - governed municipal boards.
When the party changes the municipal board in the districts, the party welcomes the party members to the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress Secretary General Mukul Rai is excited to break away from other parties and join the Trinamool of leaders.
He said that anyone who breaks up with any party is welcome in Trinamool.
He claims that under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, people are gaining confidence which has led to people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the MACPA, says that lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the TRI in fear of the terror of the Trinamool Congress.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen by the MACPA as a shock to democracy.
Any party has the right to democratically increase its mandate but the justification for changing the power of the vote must be questioned.
Australian woman appeals against Thai prison term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, has appealed the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false accusations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver along with two other individuals tried to stop him on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned safely to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
After being questioned by the police for two days, Bamfort admitted to making up the story.
He was kept in the local police detention centre before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has petitioned the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and they want to call her back to Australia.
"It was certainly a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be home soon", Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the penalty order, and has been granted bail for 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said she was vacationing at a crabby holiday resort in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in adult custody.
Likewise, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be acquitted in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Speaking on Bishnoi, the MP said that one day, when a particular community is in a house, the photo of a poor person being photographed is not a good thing.
They visit different homes three times a day to eat the chourma, but never preach it.
The MP for Rohtak, Deependra Hooda, on Friday, taking the Congress functionaries of Maham Halke, said that the rally on November 10 in Gohana is very important to you and us.
The rallying of Jan Salab will make the opposition feel the strength of the current government.
