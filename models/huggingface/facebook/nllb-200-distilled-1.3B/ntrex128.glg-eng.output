Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about being taken for puppets.
Consternation among some of the Assembly members, now known as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose over plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the scene fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name rima with Twp and with Pwp.
For those who don't know Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means caca.
A member of Plaid Cymru stated that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of Assembly members will be up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the Welsh Parliament designation.
Regarding the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
It looks like the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could prove a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disqualifying the MAs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO accession applications.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the name change in the referendum, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's keep silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one nor the other.
He said he could understand the bars disappearing.
"Now people socialize in other ways", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms people usually go to.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied communities full of the kind of people who wouldn't help keep neighborhoods sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white", he stated, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in in the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly christened the carillon the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced it with the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one has taken his place at St. Martin's.
The occupants of St. Martin's over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish and composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the latter "intends to pass on the costs" to the board, even though the latter had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors it sent to the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing for lobsters in California
Police say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was scuba diving for lobster in California on the first day of the shark season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a lobster, but that he soon realized he was screaming "I'm caught!"
I got caught!
He had a broken collarbone. Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty aisles similar to those of department stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable plunge into the UK beauty market, which amounts to £2.8 billion and which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products fall, the largest beauty retailers will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then move on to others next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for something to fill shelves that once filled TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range to make most products vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores since it bought both chains two years ago, apparently boosting grocery sales and making acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute the pharmacies' revenues in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the image of our beauty salons to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit every need and the attractive and convenient locations mean that we are now a cosmetics destination that challenges old shopping habits".
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby retires from £11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million lifestyle brand deal to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
Her company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones to sparkle by retiring from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to both their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane to Britain and headed to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave stunned everyone involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's office ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home textiles, and could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples were going on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated last night that "we should not comment on his business dealings".
A complicated conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not very presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so easily?
Trump said, adding his voice as a "news anchor".
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after their initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump sees as a big step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three weeks after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship.
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing back remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear if foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute their help.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other coasts.
Although an alert is issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed to Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and lavished money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is suffering from a severe lack of funds in the run-up to next year's re-election.
Mr Joko is also affected by the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living their faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced from their homes by street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still some 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his side lost 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it moved towards the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up landing on a Kepa Arrizabalaga who was jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to buy as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came up to Kante and they made a call without thinking too much and I just shot".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around near half-time and running into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic put up a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defence and finished on the second wicket with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people are expected to be trapped among the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything of this to step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dashboard camera that contacts us, as they may have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just been told they won't be able to re-enter for a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area was being considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, "It's horrible".
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 citing the record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
Its ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England by their fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the present debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the opinion prevailing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig slaughters a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his last name, "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a fence in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to administer vaccines to pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a big male in the corral with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to death.
"My cousin had bloody and crushed legs", the cousin, surnamed "Wu", told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
It seems Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although not very common, pigs have been reported to attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the couple's farm in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife came and scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they have no intention of harming.
You just have to have the respect you need", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rain to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it flies over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 85 miles per hour and was located about 400 miles (620 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, penetrating the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 liters/m2 of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create heavy and widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall approaching 50 or 75 l/m2 in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the Southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rainfall is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of flash flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring in locally cracked winds and dust.
The flood will bring locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flows and roads to be blocked.
This would be the first rains of the region's wet season.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday, lasting until Wednesday.
October will see large temperature swings in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves large temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, we're going to see a big example of drastic temperature differences in the central United States.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to re-emerge and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country a warm early October is expected, with temperatures to exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could hit 26 degrees Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern part of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks the moving testimony of Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political gridlock continues and the networks interrupt their usual programming for a late-night newscast on Friday: a deal engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people had seen it.
The company has counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching TV from their offices.
To give you an idea, it's an audience similar to a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which heavily supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's TV.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being crushed by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained staring downward for several minutes as he was reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said, "You have the power while there are many women defenseless".
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the cable and cable networks were live-streaming hours later as the Judiciary Committee was to vote to move forward Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to be voted on.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which a minority of Democrats were urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his on the front page, his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other party's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officers released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the shooter that killed Wayde.
The defence reported that he was placed on bail of US$350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that went to the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the neighborhood for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "depressed" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
"This is what we worry about all the time", Wade declared.
Grey volcano over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunder and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-Soviet protesters held back by riot police who were grilling them with eggs and painting them with powder, created clouds of dark dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later that day with the police, who used batons to contain the riot.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Never forget, never forgive" clashed with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue to flare in the independence-seeking region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was similar but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck, she commented.
Despite a narrow, though decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum, with many of their most prominent leaders in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more and more tension", she said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would stand in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we are suffering from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: man arrested after car rammed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car rammed multiple times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm (UK time).
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself to be the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a beast was shot into the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston's promotion surprised Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to move up a level by placing behind Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten at home this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leaders, Hearts, who are eight points behind.
But first, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remained undefeated in the division for a sixth straight game; head coach Holt has yet to experience a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing opportunities in the face of weakened visitors.
Holt's team must have been way ahead of the time they scored, as their control caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot did not cross the goal line; next, Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a header from Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the stand-up games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to lock on Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
The Rangers dominated possession at the time but were faced with an impenetrable defense that kept goalkeeper Liam Kelly from much work.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a shot from Scott Pittman with his feet, and Lithgow sent the ball out on another pitch from Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross passes were produced in the Livingston area that were continually cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and one by an inning from Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And I'm unanimous that they've been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since his return to the top flight, but some of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga didn't give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a break throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard, this time they did not reach that level.
They missed the last pass, they only got inside the home team once, a whole antenna call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the Turkish and German leaders' lunch meeting in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The demonstration duel reflected the division over a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Motorcycle crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15 am (UK time).
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are road closures and buses diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in rioting
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at the high security prison, according to the prison official.
The disturbance started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 (GMT) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A Tornado unit of specialized officers has arrived to deal with the riots, which involve eight inmates who are being held in a pavilion.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Prison staff have been deployed specially trained to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it became known that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police had to go to the prison to quell a riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought-affected areas could benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's most likely to occur early next week, when the residual energy from Hurricane Rosa moves through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a Twitter post that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread within a 40-mile radius of the Arizona border".
The latest National Weather Service models predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those outside the risk of flash flooding, the rain from Rosa could be a boon, as the region is badly affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain could be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds of up to 86 miles per hour, is 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting cold water in the Pacific and therefore, losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm late Monday afternoon or late Monday night.
It could rain very heavily in some parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 being possible", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue its ascent through Arizona and entering southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger from Rosa or what's left of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Desert of the Southwest United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains can cause sudden torrential rains and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder for the discovery of a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 0400 (GMT).
He was taken to hospital, where he remains stable".
According to Somerset Police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officers are asking for the cooperation of anyone with a recording of the incident on their cell phone.
Trump claims Kavanaugh "suffered from the petty anger" of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his accusation.
The president said Saturday that that day the "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the finest lawyers of our time with an unblemished record of public service", he said, addressing a crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from some of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't compete, but I really do", he said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to "opposed and obstruct".
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have killed hundreds and counting
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them washed up on the beaches by giant waves as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the village of Palu when waves up to 20 feet (6 meters) high broke on the shore in the Luscofusco, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency at a dam roundup in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it swept away cars, logs, houses, wiped out everything it could find", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled at 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, torn and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", he declared.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami approaching Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building frantically screaming to warn people on the street of a tsunami coming.
Within minutes, the water hits the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has already started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
It's awful.
On the way to the city of Palu, where the staff are sheltering in canvas shelters built in the courtyard of their office, World Vision staff saw scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's awful.
Even as the groups began the unpleasant task of getting disaster relief in place, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with extensive knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open up to international help, but that time has not yet come.
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the families and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would ease the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a kid was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had been training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As someone with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional charge", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the parapente community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages only showed one gray mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he added.
They steal $26,750 while loading a cash register in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was reloading a cash register in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, Investigative Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier at the resort and was preparing to hand over more cash.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind Brink's clerk and stole a bag of money he was supposed to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leave the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information regarding their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known for some time by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti, West said that same year while talking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the one, the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, also managed to put and remove the script and use uppercase letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never again to use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in the plaza of Tlatelolco that he would "never again use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to young men who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young men into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a leading Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI given China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China had presented its plan the year before: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next AI breakthrough would be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-scoring American Othello player and later was an executive at Microsoft Research, a subsidiary of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when would be the next time to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
"China is not leading academic leaders, but corporations", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work on AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA, he said.
China's State Council published its next-generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an AI Center that is intended to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any movement in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament said they would accept the result of the vote and make it final.
A change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that as of 1 p.m. there were no irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", declared Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required figure.
Another poll by the Macedonian Telma television network indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton's defence and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He lost a defense before outplaying several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first area touch to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some chest problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the early lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's field on that play.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole from the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touches before leading Sterling to the opposing pole.
The Blue Devils got the ball in the goal before they left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the party for the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there wasn't much reason to force another starting job.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the playoffs for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close out their division title.
"Even though we didn't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I've played this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but it looks like they're leaning towards Scherzer being the pitcher in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for who would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely pitch Sunday on his usual day off.
The Washington righty is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president has indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talks about the significance of the result in the midterm elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
It's five weeks to some of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't compete, but I really do and that's why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, malice, and meanness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're never going to give it to them".
The mission of the Democrats is to stand up and obstruct".
"And you've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, valky, disgusting, and liars".
He listed it to the Senate Judiciary Committee quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public applause.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Mmm.. um, what?
No, no, wait... that was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not so open anymore.
He's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
When the Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't really that surprised.
After all, I'm the latest in a series of Labour MPs who are not welcome, and all for speaking our mind.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she stood up to antisemitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are issues Jeremy would have disagreed with previous leaders about.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like this.
Sadly, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and judges whether all views are acceptable to the party leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect me to portray myself and take positions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and I really don't care what I say, there's a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring the centrist politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are made to me are often political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not so open anymore and that with every move of "non-confidence" or every change in the selection rules, the game becomes narrower in scope.
Over the last few years, I've had a lot of advice urging me to keep my head down, not be so frank and then "everything would be fine for me".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still at school, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that had literally knocked down my classroom, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be mistaken for my political views and disagreement with the current party leadership.
To those who pushed Friday's motion, all I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But in reality, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
It's possible that the last two attempts may have altered the final result a bit, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win this enjoyable Premier League match from Tenent.
Now they're leading the table and the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was his superior defense, as well as his willingness to take risks, that led the team to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we have been tested in our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than the rest of us".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot had a miss.
Climo extended the lead to Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half, he converted a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a prolonged stoppage by the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on the podium and from the restart Ayr advanced further by a try from Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a failed try from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home side came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card for scoring against Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line on the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up the pitch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to third line Gregor Henry to get the home team's fifth try.
The star of Still Game starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered he's been named CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars in with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final one, and it seems that Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia hopes court to pave way for the Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval base covered in aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century lives on, as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will give Bolivia the right, and that little would change if that happened.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to claim Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case was not complicated, says Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be behind schedule.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined the goodwill he has left for Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between its leaders.
The comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three decades after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a utopia that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will succeed in subduing the North.
Washington is resisting accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that dazzled audiences with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer, and these designers took to the catwalk with their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like fin that flooded the models' heads.
Among other large accessories were rusty watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a full-fledged scuba gear, with glasses and a tube, and another a melted ice cone.
And if you're a big guy fan, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predicted that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomba, the two-inch-long straw hat that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social media has put on the catwalk another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in her swimsuit.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and topped with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the big hats and beach bags to hit stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another crop of outstanding test scores, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible standard of education for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the careers they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got an A.
Data, collected from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained an honors degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and see them as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects like science, technology, engineering and math in the curricula of private schools and all sorts of other subjects.
A survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that amongst the reasons employers find it difficult to fill vacancies, lack of language skills accounts for 17%.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ according to school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish private schools specialise in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may hold.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain vitally important for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You gotta do it right.
John Edwards is a director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the night watchers who are eager to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still to be decided how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his Lakers' six-game preseason plans.
At this point in my career, I don't need a preseason game to be ready", he said.
Trump's campaign rallies reach Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallies scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in towns like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in recess for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained by sexual misconduct allegations and is holding off on a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with renewed momentum.
So, these five rallies Trump will hold next week are aimed at "boosting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls", Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stamina to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's singles matches
After three singles sessions, the foursome Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating momentum pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but what athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we take that as a little bit of a boost", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each have three points from four.
Spieth has proven lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
These guttural screams grew louder as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
When he got the putt that won the game on the 15th, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream that he says he thinks the American team is still out.
"You just have to focus and worry about your game", Spieth said.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way his energy seems to flow into and out of the crowd, confirms them as the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to score a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourballs, as he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first run ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede on a hole they were never even close to getting out of.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close for the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to climb four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a failing American team in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to score four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they were a perfect fit to defeat a disheveled Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 overwhelming.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursome modalities and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested from the morning's fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, taking a defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three.
Europe could not always win on a nice breezy day in southwest Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Spaniard John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after missing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team has come back four points in singles, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US", he added.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part".
While Ri was echoing well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an acting US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive aim, even though it opposes 'declaration of end of war'", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are sharpening our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the other side of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end.
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after "evil President" Trump called Kim "rocket man on a suicide mission".
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no deadline for that, and that it takes two years, three months, five months".
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we see complete, final and verified denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, just hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He noted that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are conducting a course on getting enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all of its students sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture of caffeinated all-night study.
One scholar found that students at the world's number one university often do not know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the year, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which launched for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the night-time pride still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that sleep deprivation entailed was a growing problem.
Ensuring that they get enough and good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, she points out, even preventing them from gaining weight, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, causing them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were aiming to record their first home win since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, which left his side eight points behind Hearts, leaders in the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before halftime and a Rangers lineup with little inspiration never felt like a draw.
While the Rangers have dropped to sixth place, Livingston have moved up to third and are only one goal behind Hibernian.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from an alleged object throw.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the side that beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same 11 from Livingston that took a point off the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised side smothered their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short pass sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to nail him on the second pitch.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their play on the offensive line.
No doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt they should have kicked a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers only conceded two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in facing Jacobs' strong lineup.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a single.
Gerrard acted at half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, a change that had almost immediate effect when the left-hander passed to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to push Jacobs off before Lithgow took the lead from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty for entangling with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
They can look at a protein that's common to many different cancers and inject it back in.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was booed in the studio after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again hat, she criticized the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I've been passed around backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out in that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to be pissed", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pee?" saying that I would "wear my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments caused a stir in the audience at least twice and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety, with the following testimony given to the publication by a person who was there: "The whole studio was absolutely silent".
West had been named as the final replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with a rendition of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
"However, I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder for the stabbing at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity and is forced to take a stand against the system.
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO's Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such screen roles translate into the appearance that young people often have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has gone wrong" and wonders how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the issue.
"I personally feel pretty strong right now. What have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the kids".
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by "far-right" websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies", Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the US government, during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' department and disclosed information from a member of Waters' staff, Capitol Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was done in anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It implies that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and composed".
It appeared Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Too strong if it was true", he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department alerted "law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are discovered", he continued, "as well as that they are held legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team".
Johnny English Strikes Again, the powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems this can be applied to the return of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn (Johnny English Returns).
Will the ironic satire about the obviously stupid we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent, bubbly-eyed, rubber-faced character renewed his license to screw things up a second time.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his wacky pretensions to flattering glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a little bit of that kind of thing that contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There were a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last outing.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor pads make a brief bang against his hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps out at the eye, but it gives the impression that humor has little power and is strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" films, like 007 and Mission: Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was aimed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes as the character Bean.
Now the argument that's always made is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's top-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all the British agents in the area, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination of a pompous, conflicted prime minister who's already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but there's not much you can do with the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that since all active spies have committed, you must get someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snobby institution, but gives off-the-record lessons on how to become an undercover agent; here's some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with her long-suffering old partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service mistakes are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous stunts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create a riot that gets them illegally on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Of course, all the arrests come from that last sequence, but the nice and outrageous way it is, it looks like it's from a children's TV show.
The result is fairly regular.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan to make the British work four days a week but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants employers to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still be paid the same wage.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts as a measure to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not in the policy of the party and is not being considered by it".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I would go to the hearing.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, resounding".
However, Graham's vote seems to be unshakeable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive cast of performers and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience attending had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the success rate of Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand action, or is it just another case of what's called "clictivism", people who think they're making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has logged more than 19 million "shares" from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion set to influence the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive society that has pledged to "help children develop to their full potential", pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were taken to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and hard road and at times we'll fall and fail.
But just like the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements before us, we will succeed, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to impose a blockade to hamper Russian energy exports, the US Secretary of the Interior has announced.
"If necessary", Washington may resort to the sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has warned, the Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe", he reportedly said.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke addressed the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels", he commented, while referring to Russia as having "only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only justified on economic grounds and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. stance drew a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider her 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and that includes a woman in power", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president".
Warren opined on President Donald Trump during the public rally, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through again, I can see reflected in other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers come back with", she explained to an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said her arrest was a taboo subject and that her son and other war veterans, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the military, have offered the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit over a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defies the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Sessions v. Grace lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations that face widespread problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle", the court-friendly report explained.
Prosecutors continued to argue in the report that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the country harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions stated in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as casualty numbers double in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"Circumstances are very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their flooded belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuous heavy aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of abusing "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese state newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper touting the benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, a fact China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to China and US experts, China's countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an op-ed by Branstad published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was exposed that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newsstand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he adds.
He also claims that "one of China's leading newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh disaster has lost the Republican women's vote just days before the midterm elections.
Although many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite various sexual assault allegations, analysts warn of a violent backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were in favor of moving forward with the vote.
"These things can't be undone", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) last hour for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or even in November", reflected Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, "November is Coming!" opponents demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"It's true he's already tall,
But it's going to be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs or those between 18 and 29 who, even though they don't like the president, don't usually go to the polls".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash might be possible if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on NBC News.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench or not, the issue is how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the Democratic election on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents either fully or probably believe Ford's testimony, versus 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38% believe Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, versus 30% who think the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals at a college party when she was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project from this tech legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ventured that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
Contacts lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
All of this makes this personal data warehouse unique in that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its chairman John Bruce, is that the company should bring appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, a few contracted developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission".
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War was given a posthumous tribute in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were commissioned to unveil a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a thick fog and under the yoke of intense machine-gun fire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great bravery", led the line forward before rushing into it with a cannon and no one's help, and shooting down three men from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never live with, but a lesson nonetheless".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was headlined by the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be in the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero is shown by the support of so many people".
Peppa Pig is cutting the MMA fan out of the game at the perfect time.
Imagine you're up all night to enjoy the full Bellator 206 show, and when the best part comes along something stops you.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six of which were major ones, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face off, UK viewers were stunned to see Peppa Pig appear.
Some of them were not impressed after spending so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these childish cartoons on Twitter as "a very bad-tempered joke".
"State regulations state that that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to be changed to children's programming", explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's what".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, stated that they will be taking UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition", Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change happened, I started getting a lot of messages, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
They make us very angry".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, Olympic show jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
A guest on the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he started speaking out about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first Laverne-led show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to other people because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked boys and girls".
He also stated: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what drives me and gives me the strength to succeed".
I wanted to show that I was "somebody" so that people wouldn't be disappointed when they found out about my sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She decided to speak out because she felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and she wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said dating American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years difference between them was never an issue.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (he was only 14 when he competed in his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you ask me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal", he says.
"But now I know there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was for tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him I wouldn't be here to occupy that front row", Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, the moment of his death, that I realized he really wasn't invincible", she adds.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew then that this was my lifelong dream: to jump in front of a crowd in my country at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she says.
Heather Small's choice of Proud is also not in vain, as it is the tune that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still makes her hair stand on end.

A Mickelson in poor form ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will need to improve his technique before it becomes an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourball and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so many times for America, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the peak of his career, at 48 he doesn't fit in the tight Le Golf National course, where the tall grass often punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faces Sunday's ninth game against the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start off on a strong note, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, though she couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role I was playing today, he patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and told me I would be ready tomorrow", Furyk shared.
"He was completely confident in himself.
He's got a spot in the Hall of Fame and he's been a great contributor to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way it is and that's the way we thought it should be.
Like everybody else, he wants to be out there".
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, a career that never matched his individual best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides the team with intangibles.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, witty person and likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team", she explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players have been with him this week.
It's much more with a good player".
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, fears the loss of his lead
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an awkward journey.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up coming to the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep thinking we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by a narrow margin", reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over.
We have to go get them all tomorrow.
You gotta go out there and do the right thing.
This isn't over until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we need to focus on that.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Delighted with his players' performance on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and there we must prove our worth again.
It's great to have a partner by your side when things are going well, but when you face things on your own, then you put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you need to send to the players, to bring out the best in themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also bring out the best in himself".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of these last day's laps, being part of the winning team in Brookline but finishing as the loser after the European miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had brought the players together for the final day.
"We have 12 big games, but you'd want a quick start like Brookline or Medina.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We've prepared our lineup with that in mind and we've put the players in as we see fit, we want to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole way", Bjorn explained about his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be delivered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but won't arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flamboyant frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit.
The ship was due to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will feature a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as cloaking technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates up to two years outside the home ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has already reached the astonishing figure of 3.1 billion euros, compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newer frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making waves.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was running out of ships fit for deployment.
The official says this problem is growing, as old ships have been retired, but not replaced.
She also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new study being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to forage.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the bats' activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be drawn to create a landscape-scale detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
The animals are threatened by construction and development that affect their nests and habitat loss.
Air generators and lighting are also a risk, as are glue fly traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who conduct periodic surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a big bat area", he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats, and in the case of many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are preparing to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that all people want is to be known using their name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman 375,000 USD to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the post, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the fake news in a video posted live on his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no, and a thousand times no.
What was said today is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"People want to be known by my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that they both had consensual sexual relations.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of reprisals and worried about public ridicule.
The 34-year-old woman says she's seeking to revoke the agreement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged offence, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Carmakers would leave the UK
The UK would forever regret losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer following Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need to come to an agreement", Clark added.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of carmakers is the risk to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes parts arrive from UK and EU suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the border could be affected and delays and parts shortages could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be halted.
Clark claims Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid said border controls".
"It is essential to have a deal, and we want it to be the best deal, to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains".
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a Burnaston employee for 24 years and Unite's union coordinator, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House has said that a high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Russian aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the assistant attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week or delayed by another week, given everything that is going on at the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed".
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When host Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of news sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandiosity of reporters, although she added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president", he said, though he did not cite any sources to back up that data.
Briefings will continue, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than asking her questions.
You're witnessing how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States".
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before gathered journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretary to calm the mood about Brexit
The Health Secretary has sent a letter to EU workers at NHS Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and communicating their wish for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of turmoil for everyone.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the European Union and beyond bring undeniable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
Apparently, he passed out on the line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the line before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State coach informed Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details yet on the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total innings on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
A stamp duty will be applied to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. This extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will go to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the change to raise up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is being bought by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time home buyers to access the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big building firms of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to remove tax revenue rates on moderately priced houses to fix Britain's "housing industry disgrace".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rental controls and a ban on challenges where the tenant is not at fault.
He also wants to give the city councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for each new generation.
And that requires fixing the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy homes as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof over your head remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to be able to coach Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's national team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North West club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the lead.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once for the B team, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father as a child, something I always wanted to relive.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no unease about the future of such established figures at such a big club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will my success at this point depend on me getting this club back to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly those of a Premier League club", he said.
"It won't be an easy task to come by, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back to the Premier League".
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the Hearts coaching staff.
During this time he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and managed to take St Mirren from near relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads", he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
"I really thought coaching was perfect for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't do badly, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I still suffer from stress and work pressure, but I enjoy coaching.
I've always enjoyed training, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life".

According to one survey, the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade advisory board, who compiled the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longer than expected stay in the World Cup have caused July to show a similar pattern to June, with pubs enjoying a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants have suffered an even greater penalty.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars specialising in drinks were the ones that performed best with consumption increases exceeding the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out and drink.
In the controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, an employee of the leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to outdoor consumption.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant groups continue to suffer, but a 4.8 percent annual drop will be especially painful if you add to that the continuing rise in costs.
The hot and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant business and time will tell if the moderation in temperatures experienced during August will provide much-needed respite for the sector".
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over £9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in the number of "fake Insta" accounts (referring to the photo-sharing social network Instagram).
This news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager asking to be "raped".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and President Ian Beattie has described this decision as an excellent opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a huge amount of respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her joining the board", stated Beattie.
Doyle stated: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and who currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would determine whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting work, but I was able to fully recover, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages of encouragement".
An ad for a breast milk extractor comparing women to cows divides the public on social media
A breast-milk company has divided the public online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To announce the launch of what was billed as "the world's first silent portable breast milk extractor", Elvie Company ran an ironic music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom the new extractor offers mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cow dung to the tune of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "Move, move, I'm feeding the babies, move, move, I'm moving my friends".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on social media.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case we steal their babies days after they give birth", wrote one.

Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added: "What a tactless announcement".
Other viewers defended the advert, even one woman claiming that she found the song "very funny".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Pulling out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little silly, but I interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for mothers who pump their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with discreet extractors inserted into their braces.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who suckle their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be discreetly fitted into a breast brace, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even walk around while they are sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that it entails while also demonstrating in a fun way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the extractor Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite the monthly number of border crossings remaining relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to assign best men for the children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking the step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adult members of their households would be required to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are godparents or part of their household are in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will therefore continue to pursue these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of these children to appear in court within a month of their detention instead of the previous 60 days, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to try to make their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent abductions or escape attempts according to shelter workers and system reports released over the past few months.
Lawyers said that these fears increase in larger facilities like Tornillo, where the symptoms of a child's distress are more likely to go unnoticed because of their size.
They also added that moving children to the campsite without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be "dealt with in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were being given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions target jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberals are expecting, the impeachment and scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidency"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up 1.7 million from four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news events.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? I asked.
"He said, 'Because you make me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that comes on TV, the plots that come out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the state of the global economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it involves more than being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich fur jacket ("a gift full of arrogance", the Washington Post claimed), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scant descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the character changes and daily plot twists of Trump's show (the conflict with the NFL, the praise of Kim Jong-un, etc.).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 80 degrees outside on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
I couldn't get out of the way while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these stupid shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Foreign money is pouring in to fund the midterm elections for the House of Representatives.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a major cash flow from the reorganization of a congressional district with two incumbents in the race to fill the same seat.
This newly reorganized district outside of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is largely overlapped with the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the old districts' constituencies in their favor.
The race in the new 17th Congressional District has sparked a campaign finance festival between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed a wide following.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then they backed off.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw him out of the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama back "due to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid, was discussed.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being imposed on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the administration's importance to it, diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal deliberations as long as the participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.
Studying history
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice case, of which there is currently ample evidence in the public record.
Reportedly, Mr. Mueller is also leading his own investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in their attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just as he has to prepare for the election, and he may eventually have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy either accelerates or backs down.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the water up to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information in The Times is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the FBI's just-requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if his nomination to the Supreme Court is upheld despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands accountability from Mr. Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my house, which was the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to hang Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw they achieved in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a very favourable position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something positive and we scored a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get the three points, but it's going to be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our fans, I'm sure we can fight for a positive result.
Last year was tough with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the team, but there's a great atmosphere right now.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget about last season and succeed".
Women worry about saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their families about it.
About half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they discussed with their partners the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how you will receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: avoid legal battles.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also worthwhile to sign a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail on a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who treat him?" asked Martin.

A man is shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (UK Summer Time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to rise.
Due to the communications blackout, rescue teams were unable to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, occurred on 26 December, triggering a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hits Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remember the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of one count of domestic violence, one count of obstructing a domestic violence report and one count of resisting arrest, according to a news release from Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, of course" when questioned, the jail said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffers from after serving with the Army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise as the days go by.
The quake struck just outside Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking to apply a rarely applied death penalty to the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a sentence not carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, killing pedestrians and cyclists he encountered in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injury "intentionally", according to the notice of intent for the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of the death penalty being applied according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said in describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the "heinous, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent to prosecute.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York hasn't had a death penalty case in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he viewed on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to be allowed to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved", Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise an army of people today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party claimed that politicians needed to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should take charge of the EU negotiations).
MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have already left the EU if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling the divided ranks of her party was highlighted when the pro-Remain Tories joined an independent anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her commitments to the Chequers plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr Bone stated at the Leave Means Leave Solihull rally that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been appointed, we would be outside the EU by now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated the following: We do not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
Tory and Brexit MP Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, telling reporters: "All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Currently this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class, he said.
"They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it".
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying the Brexit decision, uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us the victory over Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and self-governing United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Tories over security problems they suffered in a party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete sham.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall in a western Massachusetts town.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that she is Trump's successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
An aide asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the problems of our government, and that requires a woman in the presidency.
An arrest has been made in connection with the fatal shooting of LSU quarterback Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result of it", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who started from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone as he defended his position for the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the pack, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after several turn-by-turn maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of falling behind after a double defensive maneuver in turn three.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and climbed up to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of it by keeping his tyres to go faster in the final part and outrun Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally boxed on lap 44 but could not advance any positions on the final eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to secure the top two spots, Hamilton said.
A badly worded body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at a ceremony in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, disgusting and liars".
"The only thing that could have happened and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying", he said.
When you see these posts and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't go".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak anything?
Remember his answer -- did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't.
Wait a second.
Did we filter it? No. She added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not filter her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep his confidentiality and I did as he asked.
But his denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who remarked during the Saturday night event: "I tell you that the body language was not appropriate.
I may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who they harm, who they have to run over to regain power and control, the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by a score of 3-0
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars recovered from their Elite League defeat on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead with two Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home field before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to secure the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to bounce back to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants holding on to their previous three wins.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier after an assist from David Rutherford.
In a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the tie-breaker at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead of the scoring before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the game again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the win by his team's fifth goal in the half-final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport that was violently swaying.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It broke our hearts to find out", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to 20 feet have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline that operates a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one person is missing after previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's an extremely positive thing", Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to make it through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he had suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on dock improvement tasks also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to shore before the plane sank approximately 100 feet.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst compiles a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors referred the evidence to a retrial Saturday of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of their deaths.
Rowlett stated that he had received data from the location of several cell phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicate they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"A mockery of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be heard by a jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get combative hip hop back into the mainstream.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York babysitter demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York childcare worker is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and likened the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anguish when she discovered that childcare worker Giselle Maurice was black when she reported for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOON, another Negro", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "concerned" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the recently departed caregiver, who was African American, had done her job poorly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post ad.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and demands $350 a day compensation for the six months of in-house work she was initially hired to do even though there was no intermediate contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen", he told the Post on Friday, later adding, "It's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable thing to do, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent you a text message that I had no intention of sending.
It's not racist.
We are not racist", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just given birth to a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you go for someone like that?
That's not very ethical", the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as can be concluded in a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington".
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and not at all presumptuous", he stated.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud even though you didn't really set it up.
I think he felt the success of Paddington a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and she had to say goodbye to me over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating was slowly being used up and leaving his body.
He had died a while before and now he was dying.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without anyone noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one detected it", he said.
"I had my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of solidarity for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her".
Postcards of grieving women preventing suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said her smile would light up any room".
However, he quit his job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I have a continuing concern that a side effect will occur".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people they can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk".
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
Christmas Day has hit rock bottom (when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything)".
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "It tore the family apart.
He's got us beat.
But we have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), maybe we could get some unity", Mr Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "scrambling" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
With five weeks to go until the midterm elections (November 6), if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush was calling senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is down under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors heading to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 defectors were recorded last year, down from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in fees charged to people who cross the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which are technically still at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on eliminating the nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work roughly to eliminate nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first", Mr. Ri declared in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is not fit to sit on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved in that way, I would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the sexual abuse allegations against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and stuttering as he described his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, labeling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational assassination" staged by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not get into the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would attempt to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and the Democrats gain a majority in the House.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you're not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court you're on", Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into court and even wait for us to say, look at that!" Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage pouring in, and you can't drive her out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, is it?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you're thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad".
And then it would go on.
It seemed brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they're essentially not understood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I started to cry with indescribable rage, was an older woman grabbing me by the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always given me a slight scare, and leading me to the hole in the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called the Monkey Business and was pulled from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she couldn't consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Some call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was so advanced, he was running behind on fundraising, so he swore he would not run for president unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters had given $1,000 to male candidates, but they would only give her $250.
"What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not run a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and of anger at the existing sexism) that left her speechless.
"You'd think she'd had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled of the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be a positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war were sour, and although the war is far from over, a break between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with the imposition of new tariffs affecting the equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of the items coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way each time, most recently by raising tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has vowed to emulate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will budge anytime soon.
To get Washington to back down would require yielding to their demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate any help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It was the sixth consecutive loss to the United States on European soil and they had not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team of captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has excelled in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry very often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that kid play", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 majors, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to stay on the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk declared after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning they gave the Europeans a hard time for a moment.
We fought.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
Their 12 players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's for taking off the hat.
They were superior".
Red tide information: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
According to the most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, there is a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the above-mentioned commission, increasingly uneven surface conditions are being observed in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles (230 km) from the coastline from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Concentrations can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide was also found in Pasco County.
There have been reports of medium-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County over the past week, low and high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, low and high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, low and medium-level concentrations in Charlotte County, low and high concentrations on or off the coast with Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there are reports of continued cases of respiratory irritation.
No such cases have been reported in northwest Florida during the past week.
