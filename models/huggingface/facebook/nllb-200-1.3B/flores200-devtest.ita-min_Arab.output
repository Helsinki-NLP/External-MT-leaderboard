According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.

It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable for being twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" because of the ability to be made so thin.
It's called the pH of the substance. Using the juice of the cabbage, you can build a pH indicator.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.

To carry a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the many advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transport.

below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on smaller, considerably larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.

The lion pack acts very similarly to the wolf pack or the dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as far as the deadly attacks on their prey are concerned.

The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but it is more like a phrase of screaming, angry words.
Ocelotes love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
The ocelots are very good at seeing in the dark, and they are also very good at stealthy movement, and to hunt their prey, they mimic their surroundings and then they attack them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, thus making it difficult for it to return), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.

The original population has not changed at all; it continues to require the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Specification is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.

We build our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with it.
Though many of their foods would seem familiar, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called the giro.
Another difference was that whereas poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to dine together lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.

Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.

The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, or by those Frenchmen who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.

The American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.

The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most widely used film at the end of the analog photography era.
still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.

His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.

The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.

The strategy proved to be effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated the international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.

The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and lesser temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The 'upwardly arched' indication looks like a V and the 'downwardly arched' indication looks like a graphite or a square without the lower side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the armrope (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
A rising bow usually generates a softer sound, whereas with a descending bow a stronger and more decided sound results.

Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the destiny of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated to scientific laws and their realization in technology.




Romantism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.




It was at this point that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.




The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the aid is granted to the farmers who are not members of the farming community.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, using preserved seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximising harvests.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define as distinctive a subculture can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic nature or a set of factors.



The children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before the abandonment or escape.

When the feral child is totally raised by nonhuman animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference towards man.
project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, whereas the scaffold goes a little further.

The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of a scaffolding, but so is the little graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on his/her own.
children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not extortion.

The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on the reactions of the public to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has made it possible to make significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is claimed that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.

In the 20th century research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variabilities.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.


The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.

In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our very ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
lf you decide to reset your sleeping clock, you can set it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.

They were first bred by ancient cultures and tribes for easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Goats were usually raised in herds left free to move about on hills or other grazing areas, often looked after by goat-like goats (shepherd-like) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of pastoral care are still used today.



It became a common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails appeared.

In many cases, this only works as a symptom treatment. If we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.

After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.

The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.

The main indication of indoor poisoning might be the presence in the home of an open container of medicines or harmful chemicals.
Check if the label contains first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become parasites of man.
Both killer and bed bugs are nids, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, MS has about 400,000 known cases, making it the number one neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or that of their child.

Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.

Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
The only mutations that can be passed on to the offspring are those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.




In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they support at the same time.
sciences reveal that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed for human evolution for the last two million years.


Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonably constant and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) volume, (2) density and (3) speed.
This is useful for planning, designing and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small prey to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemers.
