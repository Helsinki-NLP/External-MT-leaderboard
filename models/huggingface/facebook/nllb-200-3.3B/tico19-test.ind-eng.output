Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease was a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe illness and requires hospital care, while the other 6% of cases develop into a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we examined the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compared them to the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced a further geographical spread and the pandemic dynamics of COVID-19 in the rest of the world are currently following the pandemic dynamics in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed case of COVID-19 based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 inclusive, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country worldwide is updated daily at 8:00 a.m. These numbers are obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of the last 14 days, thus accounting for the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 am compared to the Italian cases during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The cumulative trend of the last 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar trend of cumulative increased COVID-19 incidence (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy's total number of cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the differences in stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where around 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EEA level are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data focused on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and long-term care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and maternal care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
A modeling scenario related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with a risk of >90% exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are clustered so far in specific regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the scenario of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from containment to mitigation approaches, as a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if it is not applied beforehand.
The rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as countries have the possibility to further enhance their containment efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, other EU/EEA countries' healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing human catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on these emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly developing research subject.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, the etiology, the virology, the diagnosis, the treatment, the prognosis, and the prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eradicating this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay at home during the holiday and the weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; as such, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients being repatriated and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number one and has the potential to cause more damage than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 establishing the virus sequence isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in this rapidly expanding new subject area.
As much as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and the other disease caused by CoVs, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered but pressing questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic human co-viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which caused an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
As such, COVID-19 is currently the third recorded outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, a healthcare provider infection was reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, a regional quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves so rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presents the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but mainly in the age group of 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, only a few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than it does women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from diagnosis to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from conception to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basal reproduction rate (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the corresponding R0 is 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%) and the expected mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, spore-forming viruses that contain a single strand of sense RNA.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The spike (S) coat glycoprotein binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is joined by the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins to form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of over 99.98% among 10 samples sequenced; the samples were taken from the location of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in a very thin section of human respiratory tract epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of the S protein of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and proteins secreted by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM structure of ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is structured to form a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is a clue for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were each transmitted to humans via mosquitoes and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al. proposed a snake as a carrier of a virus from bats to humans involving recombination of homologs in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that dengue, a long-finned, ant-eating mammal frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology to the CoV found in dengue and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% variation spread across the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence are still to be found (Fig. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivated the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).4).
In general, after invading a host, viruses are recognized by the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) that limits viral spread and accelerates phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus evade an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complement, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, characterized by clusters of subtypes, are more common in elderly people with comorbid diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is compromised have a higher chance of infection than others.
Estimates of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected, but asymptomatic, people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to the virus or are infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dyspnea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after onset of illness.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without abnormal lung imaging, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a family cluster study and a cluster study of asymptomatic people.
By comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were indicated as the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
By comparison, the mortality rate for SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies as of June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not asymmetrically as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster cars are often found in a single family or from a single group or vehicle such as a yacht.
Patients often have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before admission.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, which has led to increased vigilance to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell (especially lymphocyte) counts.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and blood clotting were increased in most patients.
In severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, the degradation product of fibrin in the blood, are increased, and the lymphocyte count is progressively decreased.
Thoracic photo disorders are found in the majority of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral hazy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate the gas exchange disorder.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction lowers surfactant levels and increases surface pressure, thus lowering the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on chest X-rays often parallel the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumocyte desquamation, formation of hyaline membranes, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as many nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipping stick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians mainly offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying out a variety of previously used or proposed therapies for the treatment of other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
These include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients is proposed for therapeutic use.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to cause cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to address cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of the T cell-directed immune response; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine 4 signal suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound to China to conduct a series of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other medicines should be monitored closely.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody manufacturing
There is a long history of collecting the blood of patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize the unique molecules in the pathogen, and immediately neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification is needed to propose such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from a recovered patient and identify the genetic code that either inhibits effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtering against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of the various components in the formula. These formulae vary depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top cure rate in the therapy of COVID-19 patients was observed in some Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took for body temperature recovery, symptom resolution, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group only (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another point of interest is to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or their combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel a great deal of fear about this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and those in quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Contact history tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are critical to break the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which in the long term and effectively creates a neutralizing antibody and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a live-inhibited vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and the lethal challenge model and its protection against zoonotic viral infections must still be determined before clinical trials begin.
This may be because SARS went into remission 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immune people is a very urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (18 months on average) and the dynamic variation of the CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of disease prognosis models is very important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurs in the age group of 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care tend to have adverse comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to develop acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive colangios, which may result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is noteworthy that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and can influence each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the final outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic imaging and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive the disease end up with avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered tremendous stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture to SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when the patient is critically ill and is mostly not occurring in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hopes of halting transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states that the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A group of Canadian researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-dorsal and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the re-identified virus could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs are emerging in China, if viewed in terms of a decline in the number of new cases, which suggests that the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases and half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is also possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 has weakened its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics are given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and may also be transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
It is also found in feces, which raises the possibility of a new form of transmission, fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been due to nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other pre-existing illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with a patient or an infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860s) help to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep potentially infected sputum from being airborne or attached to surfaces where it can be passed to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring around 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with a patient should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear a translucent face shield or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home using self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is believed to be adequate to maintain patient distance.
These actions are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should be a major warning for China which has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the population by saying that the new virus has a low transmission rate and limited human-to-human reproduction capacity and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
The message was a great relief to the public, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, so that this critical time was missed to contain the disease that was still small in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China should learn from this and make big improvements in the future.
For example, it should (1) be more careful in making public announcements because every word is heard by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain potential epidemics in the early stages, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) issue targeted exercises more often and effectively to raise public awareness of epidemics and test and improve community response systems periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by a new virus SARS-CoV-2 that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries worldwide at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has the appearance of a recurrent SARS outbreak.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to contain the epidemic and manage the patient.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the death rate is also higher in older people than in younger people.
The mortality from SARS was higher than the mortality from COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients typically transmit the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread more quickly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a recovered patient may test positive again for the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of virus spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is of bat origin.
What animal species is the intermediate species for transmitting the virus from its original host, say a bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number one and two, we can't effectively interrupt the transmission and the plague could re-emerge at any moment.
Although molecular and biochemical modeling suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause further pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to ACE2 expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will this be a global pandemic, ending like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild, flu-like illness.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has reversed the trend and revealed how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmissibility, but with lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonosis, and therefore, understanding the origin of HCoV zoonotics will be useful to us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which the virus is not pathogenic.
In the intermediate reservoir several HCoVs have also been identified.
Animal host identification has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Investigations of CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, with a focus on their history of discovery as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genomic recombination.
The current CoV disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of single-stranded, single-stranded, single-capped RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", because of its morphology similar to a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have a non-segmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other, both of which are translated into the replicating polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for the structural protein, which includes a bulge or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins that are specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); of these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that bats and rodents are the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while poultry are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the throat of a cold patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that HCoV infections were generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive outbreaks in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a gross mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
Novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world should prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins in bats, mice, or pets.
There is considerable evidence supporting the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats.In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to China and the world.
The tracing of HCoV zoonotic origin provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of interspecies transfer.
These studies may also guide or facilitate the search for animal hosts, reservoirs, intermediates, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that HCoV-parent viruses are normally nonpathogenic in their natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoVs that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the ingous of a cold-infected patient, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief overview of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited flu-like symptoms, which included headache, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough that were seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequencing pathways in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears similar to that of infections caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a sick period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems have shown severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from super contagious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophage increase have also been observed in SARS patients.
Further, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly seen in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four HCoV communities have all adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when it gains the ability to move efficiently and persistently in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs are also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported with a high case mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case fatality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the case fatality in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the case fatality outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they are grouped into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but it is more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may have played a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a more general picture seen in community HCoV infections, which includes a description of mild or even asymptomatic nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 can look like SARS-CoV infections although at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also exhibits interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities with both community HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decreased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 after some human pathways still needs to be verified, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from faecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, is yet to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and continued spread in several pathways in humans, will have a significant impact on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be surviving species of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that experience severe HCoV disease have been eradicated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract host-constraining factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood of the virus becoming fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantines or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs have circulated in the human population and triggered colds in people who are immune-competent.
This virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is not sustained.
They must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar pattern to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible like community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and not pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal host or an intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have closely related ancestors and share high homology at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Ancestor viruses are usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in these hosts.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoVs continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for the HCoV or parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become deadly infectious if they cannot sustain their transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that the zero SARS cases had a history of contact with game.
Further seroprevalence studies indicated that the sellers of these animals had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The moon lizard (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that was nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the foxes in the market were killed.
However, it has been reported that the wild or farmed mussel that was not exposed to the live animal market has mostly tested negative for SARS-CoV. This suggests that the mussel may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not a natural resorber of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, that since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that many small mammal species may also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related bat CoV, called Rhinolopus bat-related SARS CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in the Chinese horse mackerel.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat stool samples was shown to use bat, fox, and human ACE2 receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct host of SARS-CoV and bats are not direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and the bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the entry route for the virus.
The sequence of MERS-CoV polymerase-dependent RNA is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in the bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 bat share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the Arabian camel has been shown to be seropositive for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as have camels of Middle Eastern origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoVs living identically to the virus found in humans were isolated from the nasal secretions of the Arabian camel. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels shed the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus shedding from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving an unknown animal species that carries MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parent-to-child relationship.
In other words, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless an almost identical bat CoV is found later.
It is likely that intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many of the early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of small endangered mammals, known as the troglobal (Manis javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new tungsten coV shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with that of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coins are closely related to RaTG13 with 90% similarity in the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viral sub-lineages in the phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Significantly, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much more different, although the level of sequence-wide homology is higher.
Previous studies in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different sequencing methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence comprising approximately 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolins as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from the pangolin due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its beta-CoV-2 cousin the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its cousin beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, crustaceans, and other mammals has yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest sequence homology in the whole genome sequence level.
It is too speculative to say that the high degree of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between the related SARS-CoV-2 traneus beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving factor of evolution, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
Researchers are still unable to conclude on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a North American tricolor bat showed close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also suspected to be its intermediate host.
To be clear, current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not very clear.
A bat-alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E has been identified.
In between, there's the alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may have come into contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca-alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene carrier of HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to the Arabian camel and from the camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification of the virus and was also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It's clear that bats are a rich viral species' host for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, well-organized colonies, close social interaction, and strong flight are all conditions that favor bats as ideal 'viruses'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the ultimate host for MERS-CoV because transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the camel's role in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the thresher, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoVs of the pangolin are highly pathogenic in the pangolin.
Tenggilis may be the final host for SARS-CoV-2's relative beta-CoV, similar to the wasp in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or ruled out.
First, bats may be reservoir hosts for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys on pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that is in contact with both bats and crustaceans.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors of the viral side are also important for making it easier for CoVs to cross the species barrier.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered medium to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per patch, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoVs to new hosts.
CoVs have exoribonuclease correction, elimination that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog of remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoV is about a million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation with humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true for MERS-CoV which has adapted to the Arabian camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will rapidly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs provides extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and function of proteins encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change their template randomly during RNA replication through a unique "select-copy" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing receptacles, strand transitions often occur during RNA CoV transcription.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetics has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral-infectious interactions in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoVs is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mouse SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is suspected of undergoing rapid adaptation in various hosts, specifically by mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively targets the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its cortex as a viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, mussel, mouse, and raccoon, thus allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between the human and the wasp virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them were located on the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV wasp has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be critical for the virus's adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 units of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed that the binding affinity of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein was 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know if there are other receptors that may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teraseetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These host protein differences between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factor and break through the host restriction factor in order to be successful in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the field of this important virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
Unbiased whole-genome sequencing to look for the dependence factors and host restriction of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be of benefit.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV acts as the HCoV gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-coding gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans as isolated SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were found to encode various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion was found in strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is suspected to be an adaptive mutation that supports host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the lineages of alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller recombination regions identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partially nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between different lineages was shown to have taken place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the camel population of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may play a role in unintentional changes to the viral genome, most likely brought about by the release of the virus from the selection pressure experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, alpaca-CoVs exhibit single nucleotide insertion resulting in skeletal shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures in their reservoir hosts.
Mild or asymptomatic symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoVs, which suggests an adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are well adapted to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of proinflammatory responses in bats would efficiently reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of the inhibitory NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptor and low expression levels of the major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of bats can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonucleases thus giving selection pressure for the creation of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when it enters a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of the asymptomatic carrier and the cause of the severe cases of human infection.
Symptoms are primarily severe due to the over-activation of the immune response as well as the cytokine storm, with the lung damage getting worse as the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been released from the CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the relevance of the immune response may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon is especially potent in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferons, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common course of emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been discovered, there are also bat CoVs sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the wasps and other animals in the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Tremeloid beta-CoVs highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that tremeloids may act as one of the intermediate hosts or that tremeloid beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have significantly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is overwhelming evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and ferrets in wet markets, it is possible that the closure of wet markets and the killing of all ferrets in them effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be moved from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolins beta-CoV lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the correctness and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans via pangolin and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the camel for a long time.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local people.
The Arab camel is widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all the camels to control MERS, as was done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can successfully eliminate the virus, a new genotype can emerge and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs that are potentially zoonotic are highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadlier to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans must be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet for a long time.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until there is a chance for their spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to maintain distance from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Some of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not been solved.
First, if bats transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the pangolins, the conditions when bats and pangolins share an ecological niche are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as a true intermediate host, how that mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and pangolins, needs to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveilans should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin, or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus may be identified in its natural host in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will unravel the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of the diagnostic criteria suspected  and confirmed  COVID-19 cases is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and has become a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, although the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and it was published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, it is worth noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and management strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Manual for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updating based on the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of one of the epidemiological histories with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or requires the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infectious case (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with a patient with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with clusters of confirmed cases (≥2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts in the early stages of infection.
Diagnosing a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole virus genome sequence showing high homogeneity for known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody in serum; or a change of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG test antibody from negative to positive, or a ≥4-fold increase in titer at the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing research of researchers to find optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood collection, which increases the availability of a variety of specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that we should be alert to patients with both atypical and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. had to be updated because they classified people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
Scoring systems also need to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of recorded infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
There were 17 deaths in total.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases are between 51 and 60 years old, and one case is between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transport will be stopped longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown has been in effect since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic necessities -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had been cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed one million worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia experienced its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remained free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States (US), there are over 244 thousand cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. from coronavirus infections.
Countries around the world announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine of the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extends curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, they were only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lowered their toilet paper purchase limit per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the Australian retail chains Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered their toilet tissue purchase limits to two and one pack per transaction in all stores nationally.
ALDI also enforced a one-pack limit on Monday.
The restrictions were announced as messages at the cashier's desk and on the network's Facebook page.
Shoppers reportedly stockpiled their supplies due to fear of COVID-19 in case the community had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change follows the four-pack-per-transaction restriction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In his March 8 media statement, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of shipment", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "took off sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of permits to two weeks ago.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
He anticipated higher production costs, as suppliers struggle to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because they had released supplies early, some stores could not hold Wednesday specials.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store stocks up every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a bulk item so the supply is low and, if sold out, leaves a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of items is felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are lots of items on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and cyanide can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, the panic may be minimized, says Russell Zimmerman via ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, insist they are working 24/7 to keep supplies on the market, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions are held as buyers take a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut up and used as toilet tissue.
Stores are actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, saying they have no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, cyanide, dry foods, hand soap, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoons the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how widely the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to urge governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, deals with, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned both by the alarming rate of spread and severity and by the alarming rate of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said, in a CNN note published in February, "except for influenza, no respiratory virus has been tracked from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "Initially, this outbreak is going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a World Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to the bat coronavirus, dengue coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the person has no apparent association with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post speculated that a case that could be traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, was likely the first.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, a relatively small number of cases have been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before herd immunity could be achieved.
A case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made it official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetectable, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basal reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number was likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not recover, the time from symptom development to death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, considering the official figure likely does not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in care homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, "We know [the announced death toll] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by unscientific reports of undercounting in the US.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy, respectively.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death-to-case ratio globally was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated case-to-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom onset 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimated range is in line with the results of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserted that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end duration of the outbreak is unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: "Without any control, an infectious disease usually plateaus and then starts to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time as to when it will happen".
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The virulence of the repeats will depend on the immunity of the group and the mutation rate.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (phlegm) production, loss of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and experience difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, chest tightness or stagnant chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and blueness of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, meaning that they have no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who are in close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and screened to ensure that they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is usually between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell initially was 30%, then dropped to 15%.
The details of how the disease is spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur mainly at close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughing can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers speculate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that persist longer in the air and are produced when speaking.
The droplets may fall into the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (PRA), can cause respiratory secretions to become aerosols and then be dispersed through the air.
Transmission can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus may be spread through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms are present.
There are few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and over four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease case cluster in Wuhan.
All features of SARS-CoV-2 are newly associated with naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, it can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has 96% similarity in whole genome level to another bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between a dengue virus and a human virus.
To date, whole-genome comparisons have found at most 92% similarity in genetic material between the dengue coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the dengue is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by viruses may be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually made via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many of the imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, which were first circulated on 17 January.
Testing is performed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed on the nasopharynx, but the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic and computed tomography (CT) imaging in people who are symptomatic include ground glass opacity, peripheral asymmetry, and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of this disease include maintaining comprehensive good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and using a towel when coughing or sneezing and throwing the towel directly in the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical containment measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or called for the cessation of all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a community-scale stage of spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they became infected. Health care providers who are dealing with people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements coming from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to another mobile phone.
Further, users will receive a message if they are in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are common; for example, rinsing the nose and flushing mouth with mouthwash are ineffective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that destroys its protective coating.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people should not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute exposure disinfectant for stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as an office or childcare facility, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the affected person, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then discard the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and range of expiratory droplets that are spread when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency for people to touch their faces with poorly cleaned hands, which is a major source of transmission". Masks are also recommended for use by people caring for others who may have the disease.
The WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 patients, although the WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks for members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend that people make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned their citizens from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the servo to wear a face mask.
Asks all citizens to wear Israeli face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, requires passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama mandates the use of face masks whenever out of the house, and recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical confinement) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Today, many governments are mandating or calling for social restrictions in affected areas.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations to gather together was quickly reduced from 250 (if no COVID-19 distribution was known in a region) to 50 and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings in public areas involving more than two people. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems who are at higher risk of serious illness and complications are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community-level outbreaks. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to make clear that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social contact, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" implies that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes the recommendation to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread COVID-19 transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last possible exposure.
The strategy in outbreak control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as to carry out other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, the next step is mitigation: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and communities.
Combinations of containment and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basal reproductive rate to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as the curvature of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overwhelming healthcare and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental-level measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries are also implementing various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass censorship and local quarantines, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who self-quarantine and imposes large fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punishes the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing the growth of epidemics) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression is selective, but needs to be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise, transmission will rebound rapidly as suppression measures are eased.
Long-term interventions to contain a pandemic have social and economic implications.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking enough water, and rest can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can worsen the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients are fundamental steps in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional office Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superior for the warning she issued.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public announcement on 31 December and informed WHO.
Quite a number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Further official data shows that 6,174 people had developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restricted free movement and instituted border controls.
National responses include containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or quarantine zones) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of quarantine zones in the United States, more than 50 million people are in quarantine zones in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in quarantine zones in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in quarantine zones in India.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December; this observation was reported by his hospital to the Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of the patient's sample on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
An announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been called "the largest quarantine in human history", the cordon sanitaire or sanitary restriction was announced on 23 January to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and was expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
Use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Lunar New Year celebration (January 25) was canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was also built afterwards, the Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implemented several measures, especially in terms of schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely are implemented in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions are in place inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Controls on public movement are in place in many cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) face some form of outdoor restriction.After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city.[citation needed] On 23 March, the only mainland Chinese case was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case via a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been essentially blocked and the outbreak has been brought under control in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the quarantine of the region was imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa at a Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provided a monetary stimulus package for enterprises. The State Council declared a day of mourning by initiating a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online with attention to physical restrictions to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the gathering of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, among 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms.
On February 28, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases are quarantined after tests confirm that three soldiers have tested positive for the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected and changed. South Korea introduced what is considered the largest and best organized program in the world to screen the virus in the population, isolate any infected people, and track and quarantine those who come into contact with them.
The screening methods include the obligation for newcomers from abroad to self-report symptoms via mobile apps, long-term or drive-through virus testing with results available the next day, and increased testing capacity to more than 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claims that the government was wrong in handling the outbreak, or on the contrary, praising the president's reaction.
On 23 March, South Korea was reported to have its lowest single-day total of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom and, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.

Iran has allocated five trillion reais to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there are no plans to quarantine the affected areas, only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to restrict inter-city travel were announced in March, though heavy inter-city traffic continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrine in Qom remains open for pilgrims until 16 March 2020.After China, Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the outbreak rate in Iran was being covered up, more than ten countries traced their cases back to Iran on February 28, indicating that the outbreak rate may be worse than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly testing positive for the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and, temporarily, to release all eligible detainees.
It was stated that there is a greater risk for spread in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 Iranian politicians or government officials in office or past have died from the disease.
As of 23 March, Iran is facing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there are likely to be five times as many cases in Iran than reported.
It was also said that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capability in responding to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Then, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced new legislation to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak area, people are not allowed to go out and come in.
Suspension of work and sporting events have been ordered in the area".On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, will be held indoors until April, but on 9 March, all sports are suspended completely for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian School of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding the triase protocols that might be used.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with most of the cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that contributing to the high fatality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the United Kingdom's response to the virus was one of the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any social restrictions or mass quarantines on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being perceived as unresponsive and lacking intensity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement calling for a halt to all non-essential travel and social contact and advising people to work from home, if possible, and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure venues, such as pubs and fitness centres, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.[25] On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to only those deemed essential.[26]
Unlike previous measures, this restriction is enforced by the police through fines and disbandment of the gang.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for businesses deemed "essential", which included supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and workshops.

On 28 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, the US government's leading public health agency, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
However, the United States was slow to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was disrupted by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies, and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing by early March (a doctor's order is required afterwards).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

On 3 April, the US had a record 884 deaths from coronavirus in 24 hours.
In New York state, cases had surpassed 100,000 by April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling the message by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus in Vice President Mike Pence's office.
Overall, approval of Trump's handling of the crisis is split across the party lines.
Some US officials and commentators criticize the US reliance on Chinese imports of essential materials, which include essential medical supplies.
Air travel pattern analysis was used to map and predict the pattern of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern over the quality of Chinese-made masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%; meanwhile, the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese-made face masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were alleged to have originated from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid is well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up and impeding prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "providing regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the move was "clearly not a WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".On 30 January, after confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first imposed during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have adequate health systems.
Responding to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily disrupt travel and international trade" and "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an outbreak occurs".
Further, Tedros made the statement that "our power limits are at the weakest link in the chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". In a press conference on 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to a "response of the full force of the UN system".
Then, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable the coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO would allow them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to bear the impact of the outbreak in the broader social, economic, and developmental spheres".
On 14 February, a WHO-led China Joint Mission Team was activated; the team aims to provide international and WHO experts in China to assist in domestic management and to evaluate "the severity and transmission of the disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national-level agencies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of countering activities at the provincial and district level, covering urban and rural settings". On 25 February, the WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic" and said that, although it was still too early for a pandemic, countries should remain "in the prepared phase".
In response to the emerging outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time for every government on the planet to face reality: Wake up.
This virus may be coming to your place and you have to be prepared", and urged that proper countermeasures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that current data do not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration means "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming rates of spread and severity, as well as the alarming rate of inaction".The WHO received sharp criticism for its perceived inadequacy in handling the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the strong reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people on April 6, which was addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to tender his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving intervention and that the government bears responsibility for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as justification to discriminate against certain groups.
Experts stress that every individual has a right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, people in prison, refugees, and other groups who need government support.
International governmental organizations are trying to address the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthen the world's health and economic systems to overcome the impact of regional quarantines and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes the Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government received criticism from the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic that began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions to the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe that this move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected previous claims of the coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, and have supported conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's covert actions have given strength to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic". This statement was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racist and "distracting from its administration's failure to address the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government message outlining a communication strategy and clearly originated at the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We were told to try and get this message across in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television". Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a "geo-political component, which includes a battle for influence through the reversal of facts and 'politics of generosity'".
Borrell also said that, "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, they are a responsible and reliable partner".
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own countries.
There have also been reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of ventilators intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy, which was hit by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China is responding bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On 22 March, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin mobilized the Russian army to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid is "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charade.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to US counterparts, [Putin] assumed that if US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get the chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary".
The planned "Defender 2020" NATO military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary General Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises are endangering not only the lives of the US troops and many European countries participating, but also the populations of the countries where they operate". The Iranian government was hit particularly hard by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected along with fifteen current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.
Political analysts suspect that this could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized "Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location.
Initially, South Koreans were divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the petition, either calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims of government malpractice in handling the outbreak, or praising his response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish people deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed on a case of supply shortages, stemming from the increased use of equipment globally to combat the outbreak, panic buying, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Some areas are also experiencing panic buying that results in a shortage of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which trigger supply shortages.
In particular, the tech industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand caused an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
Chinese and Italian measures to combat the illegal hoarding and trafficking of important products have succeeded in preventing the anticipated acute food shortages in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the nutritional sufficiency of the population.
Similar legislation exists in Italy, which requires food manufacturers to keep a reserve for emergencies like this.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on 16 March, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the outbreak of the virus is considered to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
As of January 2020, some analysts estimate that the impact of the economic collapse due to the epidemic on global growth may exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by experts at Washington University in St. Louis stated that the outbreak impacted more than $300 billion on the world's supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "in a daze" after oil prices plunged in response to a drop in demand from China.
On 24 February, the global stock market fell due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to mounting concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 20072008.
The three stock indexes closed the week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, with the biggest drop coming on March 16.
Many people think that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central bank and the state.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional carrier Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at an unprecedented level.
Some train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving large crowds were canceled by the central and local governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its infectious disease control to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers were down 5060%.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in foot traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause people living in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase by between 14 and 22 million people compared to a situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in the outback provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely impacted by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Arts and cultural sector organisations seek to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the public, safeguard the safety of employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at varying rates, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions are closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being deployed to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another detrimental impact of this new and rapidly growing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also disrupted, as the Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian seniors to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, live online or television, while others offer drive-in or line-in services.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the evacuation of Saint Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the subsequent closure of places of worship, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but no later than summer 2021".
This has led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registrations, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands postponing or cancelling concert tours.
Many major theaters like Broadway are also postponing all shows.
Artists are exploring ways to continue to produce and share their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live online broadcast concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publicize their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have been circulated online with many people turning to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as towards people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) noted the racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve the virus or receive what they claim as a corresponding reward.
Some African countries have also seen an upsurge in anti-China sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There's already support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be targets of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racial harassment and assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus the "Chinese virus", a term that critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Bharatiya Janata Party president of the state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that used paid censorship have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the outbreak available in open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a preprint server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA only.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and surveillance of populations.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from these test results.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be considered too high in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasal swabs or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
A throat RT-PCR test is only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus can then disappear in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested at the second week, sample material can be taken from the deep airway using a tracheal catheter or material excreted through cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and constitutes at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed the test on 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detector on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that is shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories via the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests on the old version of the test tool gave inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using the two components was deemed unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that were state laboratories and local laboratories allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit is announced; collection and processing of specimens should be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours with a high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology other than PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the nucleocapsid (protein N) protein of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
A literature review published in March 2020 concluded that "thorax imaging has little diagnostic value in the early stages, as CT [computed tomography] findings may already be present before symptom onset".
Typical features of CT include the opticity of a ground-glass multilobar bilateral with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current point of origin of the pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of the imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as about 7 days after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although a series of specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin prick is generally used.
Unlike the PCR method, the extraction step is not required before the examination.As of March 26, 2020, the FDA mentions 29 agencies that provide notification to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It can test up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody kits it had purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme so that suspected patients could stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube, they spit in it, send it back, and get the test results a moment later". NHS England announced that the NHS was pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home so as to eliminate the risk of the patient infecting others if they come to the hospital or having to disinfect the ambulance if used. In the on-site testing of cases for suspected COVID-19, a health professional would take samples using appropriate precautions.
The test centre has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is covered by the health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the test of the lantern is offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown as only positive results have been reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined samples were found positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000 square meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for handling quarantine could be doubled if this testing capacity were not in place.
The Wuhan lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan's labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations.
Until March, shortages and insufficient reagent quantities had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As such, a number of researchers are attempting to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating a sample at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.
This was achieved through a combination of long-term testing and the purchase of mass-produced population-scale laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this scale outside China.
Various test recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of test kits that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, thus delaying the testing available in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts' testing.
Instead, experts say that the availability of extensive testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has left hundreds of thousands of tests pending in private US laboratories, and supplies of tailoring tools and chemical reagents are critical.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed the bureaucratic obstacles that prevented private testing.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to a failure to collect samples or use the test tool properly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would withdraw the equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another one provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kits be thrown into the Danube river. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "using them".The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test kits could not be used.
The testing, followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracing of people who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive endpoint.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vò, site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on a whole population of 3,400 people, spaced about 10 days apart.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in place, new infections are completely prevented.
With aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic developed much more slowly than other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also tackled the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines, but with less aggressive territorial quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatality rate, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 referral labs, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% positive test result" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
Countries that test only people who are in the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive results than countries that test all of their population, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with the aim of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Consistently washing hands with soap at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
People can also catch respiratory illnesses, such as influenza or the common cold, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times throughout the day that are very important to wash hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After clearing the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal excrement.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronaviruses, and other communicable diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And it also reduces the rate of infant mortality in home birth.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may slightly increase toddler height.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in cases of diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ISPA), as it is a subconscious behavior practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, which is the leading ISPA, is the number one cause of infant death; it causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet an ingrained habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, and reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against the infection of impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially prevalent among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease by fecal-oral route, namely: before and after using the toilet (urinate, defecate), after cleaning a child's bottom (change diapers), before washing a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when it is important to practice proper hand-washing techniques to prevent the transmission of disease are before and after treating a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing a nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching litter.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap.[142] A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent.[143] Several behavior change methodologies are now available to increase the adoption of handwashing with soap behavioral habits at critical moments of habituation.[144] Group handwashing for students at predetermined times is one of the options in developing countries for introducing handwashing into children's behavior.[145]
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a proper scale of action to support children's health and education.
The administration of a twice-yearly worm-killer, combined with daily hand-washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleansing microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic dirt, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by adequate water flow.
Solid soaps, because of their reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous use.
A small number of studies that examined the transfer of bacteria from contaminated soaps concluded that transfer was not possible because the bacteria were covered with foam.
However, the CDC still states that "liquid soap with a hand-free disposal is preferred".
Antibacterial soap is heavily promoted to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strain organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective substances, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (buffalo tongue, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Warm water that is comfortable to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that hold dirt and bacteria back.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubbers, antiseptic hand scrubbers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel or with a humektan such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are an efficient germ killer.
Alcoholic fermentation of rubbing alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log decrease 3.5, similar to 35 decibel decrease) of bacteria on the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log decrease 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hand 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of the hands and between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing them on both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of rubbing the fingertips, especially when the hands look dirty.
The increased use of cyanidating agents is due to their ease of use and quick killing activity of microorganisms; however, cyanidating agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can lead to dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcoholic hand scrubs are rare.
A lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis is the appeal of this product compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, non-aqueous agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still on the hands.
The success of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends greatly on the ingredients and formulation, and historically, these products have performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol-free rubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose potency has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to a progressive side effect reaction.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less so than soap.
One concern is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if it comes in contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as a soap alternative when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for preventing the transmission of disease include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cool running water.
The recommended flow rate is that the water in the reservoir may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature does not seem to be affected.
Wipe your hands with plenty of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing longer removes more germs.
Swallow carefully under running water.
Washing in the sink could make the hand contaminated again.
Dry with a dry rag or let dry in the air.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to be re-contaminated, and the areas that are most often missed are the thumb, the wrist, the area between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmitting infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a suspended and covered jar or bottle and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
The tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a handful of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleanliness of tissue paper, warm air hand dryers, and the more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an average increase of 42% in total bacteria in the fingernails and 15% in the palm.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhausted air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After drying the hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel dryers.
Hand washing with a hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was mandated long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of these devices.
Medical hand washing is performed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or a gel to rub and scrub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers joined together.
If there is dirt under the nail, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water on the hands, the hands should be washed carefully and dried with a clean cloth.
Once dry, a sheet of paper is used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit doors if necessary).
This avoids recontamination of the surface by the hands.
The purpose of handwashing in health care settings is to eliminate pathogenic ("germ") microorganisms and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching a patient and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a spreadsheet that sets out the standards for hand washing and hand scrubbing in the health care sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Hours" to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
before aseptic duty, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soaps (soap "medication" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill the hand washing agents.
Such a killing function may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To 'rub' the hands before surgical operations, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile cloth to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the nail beds are required.
All the jewels must be removed.
The procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms down to the elbows, usually 26 minutes.
Long scrubbing times (10 minutes) are not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling sick people.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning comes from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit is very small when hand cleaning frequency is increased above 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious disease to food than washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between hand scrubbing with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand scrubs reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubs at reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand scrubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions across a range of health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a basic, cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or hand-washing facilities in residential homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal hand-washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps near private or public toilets are rare, although options are available to create inexpensive hand-washing places.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be due to ingrained habits and not due to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavioural change.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation is required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective.One example of handwashing being prohibited in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can move from one star to eventually three stars.
Building handwashing facilities can be part of a handwashing campaign that is being carried out to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of behavioral change.
Several studies have examined the cost effectiveness of hand washing overall in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) or measures of years lost to illness.
One review showed that promoting hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than water and other sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as a new mother giving birth or a wounded soldier in hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At that time, many people still believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against the contagious disease.
For example, posters of "proper hand-washing technique" are hung next to hand-washing sinks in public restrooms as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands off" means expressing one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to engage in something.
The phrase originated from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used phrase in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to cleanse imaginary stains; an act that shows her guilt for the evil she has done and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been found that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value handwashing equipment more highly.
Furthermore, people who are left to wash their hands after meditation have less chance of engaging in compensatory "cleansing" activities, such as volunteering.
Hand washing is a ritual part of hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, the Tevilah and the Netilath Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand-washing after using the toilet.
Additionally, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all require handwashing before and after eating.
Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to hazard control for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the workplace and job assignment, which is based on an assessment of the risk of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers; for these occupations, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a regular basis.
Moderate exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing personal protective equipment when encountering COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgue workers exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if the worker performs an aerosol-producing procedure on, or collects or handles specimens from, a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have some impact in the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping outside of peak hours, by delivery, or on a chain).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographic areas that are highly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and job duties, including the sources of exposure, risk factors arising from household and community arrangements, as well as individual worker risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks and the emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of containment include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located influences the countermeasures taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by their effectiveness.
If the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical control includes isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or procedure that requires action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs must be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirator), consistently and correctly worn, inspected, maintained, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure occupations have minimal work contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and litter containers, preparing for remote work or work shifts with gradual arrival/disappearance times, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routinely cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
The early identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medication or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies be flexible so that they allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk occupations include those that require close contact or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because a new individual is traveling internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and high-volume retail settings. Technical controls for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing drive-through windows or lattices for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with gradual arrival/departure times, stopping non-essential travel to locations experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19, developing an emergency communication plan that includes a forum to alert workers, equipping workers with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers on the need to use protective clothing and gear and how to use them, providing a work environment and personal hygiene resources that support and require regular hand washing, limiting access to COVID-19 and public hand-protection and hand-washing, and other workplace safety precautions that may include wearing protective eyeglasses, or at least wearing a mask, or other protective hand-wearing gear at workplace, or other workplace with a hand-protective hand-guard.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If someone falls ill on an aircraft, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly other personal protective equipment if a sick passenger develops a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, self-isolating, and informing the on-board medical center immediately if a person experiences a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the quarantined person's cabin. Apart from community spread, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building.
If there is community transmission at minimal to moderate levels, social distancing strategies can be implemented, which include: cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing table spacing, graduated arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extending school closures may be considered.For law enforcement officers conducting routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must come into contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during capture, workers must clean and disinfect the belt and duty gear before reuse using household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APDs and to control and wash dirty laundry.
OSHA considers certain healthcare workers and morgues to be in the high or very high exposure risk category.
High-exposure risk occupations include healthcare, support, laboratory, and transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes at very high exposure risk if the worker performs aerosol-producing procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk morgue work includes workers involved in preparing the body of a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these jobs become at very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
The specimen should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of a known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better filter-filtered N95 face mask respirators must be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend full-face or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for screening staff at the point of entry.
For people who are collecting respiratory specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective eyeglasses, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that APD supply is inadequate worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APDs through tele-medical services, physical barriers such as a transparent window, with only people involved in direct care being allowed into rooms containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APDs required for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it when treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and encouraging no mask use for asymptomatic people.

Subject: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is an example of a list of the most commonly used commands.
CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder of the global human connection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
We've never experienced the challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendliness and caring that we've witnessed among all of our co-workers through email, phone calls, and chat is a tremendous validation of the extraordinary people that we've been fortunate enough to work with.
It is with immeasurable gratitude and pride that I can call you all my fellow workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol of this important resource to keep available online for everyone.
Your work makes this happen, whether you're keeping the site running, helping pay our associates, or helping keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is the moment when not just what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to be making some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization viable through this time.
We're very keen to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't have any day off, so if you can work more hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable these days, and whether you need to care for a loved one, shop for essentials, or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have to be said, but we said it.
No sick leave or PTO is required, just let your manager and your team help you revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed as having COVID-19, please let Bryan know inside T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management).
Colleagues whose pay is based on hours will be paid in full.
We've said it before, and we'll say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal hours when things are normal.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress into the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to be done.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust & Security, as well as Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We're going to begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, so we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't do any good for the future.
We don't plan to "challenge overtime" after this pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the current unrealistic deadline.
We recognize that the situation is changing and will endeavor to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intent is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so employees can prioritize essential work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressure across the organization.
We'll present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership on this.
Status, exposure, and office cleanup
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of concern, we hired a virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They're using hospital-grade antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floor.
The building implemented its own safety assurance protocols using products that support occupant safety.
We were happy that the office would be ready for use when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Starting last week, our DC office has been moved to a full-time remote work order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we're also in discussion about renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues who work remotely realize that it may need adjustment and they want to give you some advice:
The maximum length of the meeting is one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Define meetings clearly, make an agenda, and send reading material ahead of time.
Set video as the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Designate a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and note the list of speakers, and someone to help take meeting notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Email tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to coworkers about shared work
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the enhancement of distributed work throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Edit-a-thon, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We let them know that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activity and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify the target.
We'll follow up this week with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be one of sadness over this disruption, but also one of relief over the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll be sending an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take some time to connect with each other.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep this page updated and make sure all the information is in one place.
We are also working to maintain routine communications with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to let us know and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations for HR International.
None of these changes should be seen as a dereliction of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, it is an acknowledgement that, at this point, our jobs and our responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are essential to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services it depends on.
The work we planned in advance will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that will come in the next few weeks and perhaps months.
We need all of you to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as hard as you can when you need to.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following is a list of the members of the Leadership Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite to that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an M2 peptidase domain of N-terminal and a renal collectrin amino acid transporter domain of C-terminal.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes mainly of type II alveolar cells of the lung, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE is the breakdown of the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on the spike of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cell.
This viral entry process also requires priming of protein S by the serine protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on 11 July 2012, found that "use of an ACE inhibitor led to a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who are at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a half-life of 30 minutes in addition to a duration of effect of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation.
b'The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracing applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns were raised, especially with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
A less privacy-invasive alternative includes using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 cities in China.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app is in advanced development and will be available for distribution in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this app is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false positives and possible ineffectiveness if the data being retrieved by an application is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple set a limit on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting it to only "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued statements calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
the surveillance must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the monitoring and surveilans extension shall have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid the increasing discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The meaningful participation of all "relevant stakeholders" is required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups.
The Google/Apple plan proposed intends to address the continuous surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential to significantly impact privacy.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to private location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce text message notifications to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed by a sweeping change in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracking is an established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record users' proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches, and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Decentralized Privacy Protective Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called the Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or intersectional data streams to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was originally also founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that have a fundamentally similar approach and are many overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and alerting applications, which is a key aspect to achieve widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced initiatives for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protective cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three phases:
Launching tools to allow governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to overcome the problem of data capture and continuous surveillance by first distributing the system through an operating system update, and then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also called drug re-targeting, re-profiling, or drug re-tasking or therapy switching) is the use of an approved drug for a new treatment purpose, that is, for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of drug development.
This pathway is a scientific research pathway currently underway to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 proteins that can be targeted for drugs, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand-binding sites could form the basis of a project to develop an antiviral drug that is effective against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicases, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A, et al investigated several candidate compounds which were then optimized and analyzed for their core similarity to approved drugs and had the highest similarity to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs potentially in their preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochlorokine are two of four drugs to be studied as part of Solidarity's clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochlorcuine in New York would begin on March 24.[42] On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).[43]
The drug has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors say they use it when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, whereas the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency warned the public that the evidence to support the drug is limited and premature.
On 2 April, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for stockpiling and use the military to ship the drug to the university hospital, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to purchase the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a multiplying virus.
This medicine may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community regarding the allocation of resources to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the emergence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University Hospitals of Cleveland, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and have severe COVID-19, two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new presymptomatic coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases in hospital in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 years and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-center study in 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at both prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has focused on giving new treatment targets to antiviral drugs approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some of the antibiotics identified as potentially novel drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): Approved by the Chinese.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative issued a statement in April that the key considerations for developing a vaccine are speed, production capacity, deployment at the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The primary platform targets that advanced to the Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developer of the Phase I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus (developer of Phase I vector and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little publicly available information (believed to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials perform initial safety and immunogenicity testing, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease, while monitoring for side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are actively in development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" studies).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating a potential molecular trap vaccine that would genetically modify the virus protein to stimulate an immune response.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they had started developing a vaccine, with a target of human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On 27 February 2020, Generex's subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that they had started a vaccine project to make a peptide Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Training Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were partnering with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Further, the partnership announced plans for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would take at least about one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered "'a large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will have preclinical testing results in April 2020 and that a late-stage vaccine candidate could start testing in humans in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the total investment of CEPI in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 COVID-19 medical response research projects, which includes a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At roughly the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million in funding specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in mice; they stated that "MNA administering the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine elicits a potentially antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that is visible 2 weeks after immunization".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is engineered to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access the supercomputer from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further tracked trial in Australia sought to follow up on 4,170 health workers.
There's a chance that the vaccine in development won't be safe or effective.
Initial studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggest the need for containment measures to achieve biosafety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no proven safe and effective vaccine or vaccine for SARS in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the pipeline, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have fueled conspiracy theories claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known before and that a vaccine was available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach upset.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between humans during close contact, often through splashes or small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced by inhalation, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the disease has progressed further.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and for those who are caring for them.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend against the use of masks, some recommend their use, and some require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip discoloration; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Symptoms of upper respiration, such as sneezing, wheezing, or a sore throat, may be encountered, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially had only clinical signs of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is being researched, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral load on a large scale.
Speaking aloud releases more splashes or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can push droplets as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission is possible and air collectors placed in an aisle outside a person's room produce samples that are positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (PCR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted to aerosols and then dispersed through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products strip away the protective layer of virus fat, deactivating the virus, and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken within a median of two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory illness cluster in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally occurring coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which destroys its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to attach to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and disorders of the immune system during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very highly in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells have been shown to be correlated with recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on a breath sample obtained through nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal swab or sputum samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart so the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate this strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing independently to detect infection by this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infection and if a person has been infected before) is in development, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience with such testing has shown an accuracy of only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobate ground-glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution is commonly encountered early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the lobular septum with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsies are:
Macroscopic: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lung, and pulmonary edema
Four severities of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of many nucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate is common.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
curative pneumonia: exudate formation in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if a tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large numbers of people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale gatherings in public places.
Restrictions also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19.Since a vaccine is not expected to be available until early 2021, a major part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are unavailable.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active agent for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspecting they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle as well as a healthy diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonary specialists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers who are treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.
Recommended equipment is: an APD cloak, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial ordering, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not listed on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are severe.
Types of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure are actively being investigated for hospitalized people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two methods produce the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to remain on invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles as compared to the high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, limiting the capacity of health systems to deal with sudden spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered an intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure control mode and PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-associated pulmonary and pneumothoracic injury.
High PEEP may not be available on an old ventilator.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some drugs under trial have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe illnesses.
Volunteers who WHO recommended participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases of a person's life being severely or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies needed to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to address the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
It is able to detect 'close contacts' using surveillance data so that it can detect potential risks of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials.Major analytics on mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and people who came into contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by mobile operators that "40% of residents are still on the move".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantines, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline are the perfect storms that threaten people's mental health and well-being".
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may require three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still lacking.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidney, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 profile showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, patients who were moved to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study looking at early cases, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of a postmortem lung sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudate in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung is similar to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients have a congenital condition. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of light case counting can cause death tolls to be overcounted.
However, the fact that the death was the result of a past case may mean that the current mortality rate is considered too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections confer effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity is considered possible, if observed in the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test several days later.
This case is believed to be a residual infection that has worsened, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, through infection spread.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset date of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically diagnosed or epidemiologically unconfirmed deaths from COVID-19 for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the disease is transmitted through the Carnival festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as measured from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates differ for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the new risk differential between men and women not seen at age 90.
In China, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men having comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers is higher, particularly nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as interim names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines that called for no place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital badly needed ventilator valves, and the supplier could not deliver on the required time scale, a local company re-engineered and printed 100 of the required valves overnight.
After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of treatment of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine against the virus.
The use of such viruses, either inactivated or dead, aims to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus infiltrate the enzyme receptor ACE2.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique to make vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method remains controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly targeted antiviral drugs form the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is underway. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency medicine.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that a double dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that early priming of the spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in severe to advanced COVID-19.
Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines of treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a phase 2 clinical trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illnesses.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some of the affected people.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and bound antibodies produced by the systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of non-vaccine passive immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, is in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid fraction of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronary disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
