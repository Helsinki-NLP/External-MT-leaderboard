Traffic Flow is the study of traffic behavior and the interactions between two points that create interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study highway currents because traffic congestion cannot be as high as 100 percent.
Fortunately, these factors usually depend on the direction and direction of the road; therefore, the flow rate of traffic can also be calculated using mathematical calculations.
To better describe traffic flow, the linkage has been made up of three main components: 1. Speed 2. Height 3. Speed.
These connections were useful in planning, designing, and maintaining the road infrastructure.
