You're up early, aren't you?
Please.
It's not possible.
Your job should come before your family.
Go to your garden.
Your hair should be cut short.
Your heart is free, just have the courage to follow it.
It's heartbreaking, and it's alive and well.
Your only job is to keep your dreams alive.
Your outer body will eventually decay and die.
Your speech was appropriate for the occasion.
Your time is up.
You have to admit defeat.
You must ask your father for guidance and follow it.
You'd better not smoke in front of him.
You need to get some rest.
You should go and cut your hair.
You should have kept it a secret.
You should keep your mouth shut.
You shouldn't have done it just for my amusement.
You don't respect someone just because they're rich.
You have to order in advance.
You have to pay your debts.
You should say whatever you think.
You have to tell her the truth.
You should be wearing deodorant.
You have to work hard.
You can take an umbrella with you if you need it.
You trust people too much.
You two are really nice.
You have small eyes.
You should see Tom.
You're getting fat.
You wanted to talk to me about freedom?
We were so close, so we're gonna give you one last chance.
You will be able to read this book next year.
Soon you won't think of him anymore.
You'll understand in time.
You'll write a letter.
You're not going to calm him down with that explanation.
You're not comforting him with that explanation.
