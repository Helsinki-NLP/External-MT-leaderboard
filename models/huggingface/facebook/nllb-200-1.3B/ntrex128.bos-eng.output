Welsh MPs are concerned about the similarity to the Mapetites.
Some MPs are outraged by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could become a subject of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid said the group as a whole was "more satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there was little difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission that is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of the name change stated:  The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals which resulted in a large support for the appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the members of the Assembly, the commission has preferred the title Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public debate.
Assembly members are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach a consensus could give a headache to Speaker Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the assembly functions, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and a plan for the commission system.
Members of the assembly will have one last chance to vote on their name when they debate the bill.
Macedonians go to referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor represents an appropriation of its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider the name change simply the price they must pay for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
The bells at St. Martin's have gone out as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
"The older people I spoke to said that there used to be bars and churches on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither.
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People are hanging out differently now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people go to on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the property sale won't last as long as the executives expect, and sooner or later, it'll go back to where it started.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who would not help preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that's why the closing of these churches will be accelerated because it's unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis - a Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
The black community that worshiped nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black community under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who were opposed to the hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners worked out a plan for renovation, they ordered the organs.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organs "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Experts Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these are the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Episcopal Administration, the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs to the diocese, although the diocese was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy during a lobster hunt in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour on Saturday when he heard a boy calling for help and then he and his group rowed to him and helped him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was the thrill of catching the lobster, but then realized he was screaming, "She bit me!"
She choked me!
His entire collarbone was torn apart, which Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles also added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Officials have closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains to the department store style cosmetics department where professional assistants work.
As part of a major breakthrough into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which is growing as sales in the fashion and home appliance markets decline, larger cosmetics units will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics is coming as supermarkets find ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics range by offering more than 3,000 products, including products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in suites similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its boutique makeup line by making most of the products vegan-friendly - something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test out locations at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to everyday purchases of smaller quantities of food from local stores means that supermarkets must make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores in a bid to counter the supermarket's blow with big discounts from Aldi and Lidl, with more service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of its stores, and has also introduced Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has increased food sales and purchasing profitability.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments ended in disgrace.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmacies in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skincare products to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location mean that we are now an unavoidable destination for a beauty market that sets new standards over the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones angry after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Dragon's Day star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal with his personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household goods and accessories Truly.
This couple's company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons star Peter Jones by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute to focus on her lucrative new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the golden girl of television admitted, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to their Truly brand of home and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced his departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain for one of his weekends.
The source said Holly has put Truly at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would secure her income for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The headquarters in Marlow has a warehouse full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and possible additional delays to the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in March as CEO.
Couples are going on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Anna McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we would not comment on his business".
♪ Hard words, and then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he might get from the media for comments that could be characterized as "un-presidential" and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his funny news reader voice.
I didn't give in at all.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump had declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "adequate response" by the United States to North Korea's initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the US continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of lives would be lost.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to mend ties with Kim have yielded positive results - a halt to missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood up to defend his unusual approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, no national disaster status has been declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it will be quite difficult", said Ms Sumbung.
As Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, they're still unsure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on Palu Island to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it's sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often seen in other parts of the coast.
There were no tsunami sirens on Palu Island, although the warning was in effect, so that too contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, traveling between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to provide assistance to earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's ageing infrastructure and spared no money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration as he looks forward to new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge scoring a deep-lying equaliser against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri some 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left side, and then he kicked it into the outfield.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, heading towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally, it fell over Cape Arrizabalaga who was jumping and fell into the net.
"It was just positioning, getting the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker added a fifth on that attack to Matthew Kovacic before running from midfield into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick touch and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near the stumps by putting his left foot in the net past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool are facing Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videotron in the Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that raised waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is covered in the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people who saw or heard something nearby to report it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said the investigation is in the early stages, but I'm calling on anyone who's been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who's seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something with the cameras on the car's control panels, to contact us as they may have information that is relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cabbie who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents have now been told they will have to wait for hours before being allowed back inside.
They heard a cop tell one man that the whole area was considered a crime scene.
One woman came to the scene of the crime in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so terrible".
At 2pm, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next door.
Most of the officers were inside the police cordon guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers hotline anonymously on 0800 555 111 stating case 247 as of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monument amid the debate over the revision of history.
Its removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that were carried out in the manner of the Taliban by his puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would also become a target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted iconic raids during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The majestic depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as the protector of Parliament from outside pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a distinctive figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and mention.
The pig killer has inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
A man, known only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pig market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A piggy bank was preparing to inject pigs with pig vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with a cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piggy bank with blood all over his mouth.
Forensic investigation has confirmed that a 550-pound pig inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered", said a cousin who identified himself as Wu, Guiyang Evening News reports.
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market's owners are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, suffocating the man to critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had grabbed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared her away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an "offender".
They're just playing.
They like to prick, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing widespread splashes to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flash floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosie's Category 1 hurricane winds reached 85 miles per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and it was located 385 miles southwest of the town of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rift is forming in the Pacific Ocean and moving east and west along the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture along with the coming chasm will create widespread splashes in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in flooding, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will result in rainfall that will occasionally reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical dispersal of tropical rainfall.
A desert hike would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms could result in occasional high winds and sandstorms.
The coming rift will bring tidal surges to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation of over half an inch is possible, which could cause landslides and avalanches.
This will be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
A calm, scattered tropical storm will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more widespread later Monday and Tuesday.
The surge will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, there could be major temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a great example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try to buy back and spread.
The beginning of October will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast predicts a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony before the Supreme Court on Thursday, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political unrest continues, with broadcasters cutting regular broadcasts over the latest plot Friday: the deal Arizona Senator Jeff Blake made with the FBI for a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching and trying to undress at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has computed the viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the people who watch the broadcast from the office.
To put it more plainly, it's a crowd similar to the one that watches a football playoff or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose editors backed Kavanaugh's nomination, led the way with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras from CNN and CBS caught a protester screaming at him after he tried to get into the elevator to attend a judicial commission hearing.
He stood staring down for a few minutes as he was insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and TV networks had a live broadcast hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the nominee next week, which is what the Democratic minority is calling for.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that is next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson went on to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU take tariffs on each other is "totally absurd".
Police have arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video footage of Sims and Simpson arguing, and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have recovered the glasses from the scene of the crime and say they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB network CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said the credit goes to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement agency for its diligence and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we're always worried about", Wade declared.
The volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity at the crater increased and after 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been following more tremors and rumblings.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering wind-driven cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit as thousands joined counter-demonstrations marking the anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police unit, shot at them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, they had a run-in with police who used a pendre to put down the fight.
The pro-independence protesters chanted "No Forget, No Forgiveness" for hours and clashed with the pro-union protesters who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that has pledged independence a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists are celebrating.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession mounted a boycott of the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to prevent demonstrations and give support to the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a mess, he said.
Despite a crucial but narrow victory in local elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep pace as some of their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a phone call to police support, said politicians on both sides were supporting the conflict.
"It's getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities", he said.
Londonderry: male persons arrested after driving into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after multiple car crashes into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7:30 PM UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from a machine gun.
Meng's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Meng's first goal secured the victory for Livingston
The upgraded Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games for the Ibrox club.
Golly Mang was the key, while Gary Holt's club is tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club have not recorded a single away win in the Premier League this season and will play top-seeded Hearts, eight points behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his league win streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to experience a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against guests who lacked sharpness.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored because their direct play was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt passed by, then Alan Lithgrove's attempt passed by after he slipped to receive a ball that Craig Halkett headed towards the goal.
The hosts were right to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the visitors from free kicks.
And that way, the key goal is achieved.
A free-kick was awarded against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mango, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but the home defense remained untouched and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free kick for Livingston.
The Crosses were constantly coming into Livingston's penalty area and were constantly defended, while the two penalties they sought  one after a foul against substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for a hand play  were not awarded.
The phenomenal play of Livingston
Alasdair Lamont, the BBC Scotland correspondent, is at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal game and a score by Livingston.
All but one were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but great credit goes to Holt who has been energizing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral in line throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
As good as they were from time to time under Gerrard's stick, they never reached that level.
They've missed the playoffs, they've only broken through the home line once, and this is a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) was marked by smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
They split on issues like human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were also out loud, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The double protests reflect the divided opinion of the guest, who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the Deptford Highway, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance was called in, but the man was killed on the spot.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist was killed in a crash in which the driver left the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, which is about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses are diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison, six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, on Sunday at around 0930 British time and are still ongoing.
A special unit of officers Tornado has been called in to quell a riot involving eight prisoners in one wing of the prison.
The officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison administration said, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison".
Six crew members received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may be given extended prison sentences.
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a special unit was called to the prison for a serious riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City.
It's rare for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy passes through the desert southwest, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will signal rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest forecast is 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon, Arizona, up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it will likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In parts where there is no fear of flooding, Rosie's rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be useful because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which will still be a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and will therefore begin to subside.
So it's expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
The surges in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a major flood risk.
"Total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and possibly as high as 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico in the force of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat from Rose or its remnants is expected to be large splashes in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the American southwest desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These splashes are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack, four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4am UK time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials are urging anyone with any cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has endured the meanness and rage of the Democratic Party"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's cruel and unprecedented tactics", Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the viciousness and rage of the Democratic Party during the nomination process".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted them decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said Saturday that Americans had seen Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record in public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president has indirectly touched on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican outcomes in the midterm elections.
Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
"Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running", he said.
That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to "strengthen resistance and disruption".
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was announced yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they died", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, in a speech in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it carried cars, boats, houses, it hit everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's possible that the geographic position of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, increased the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications have been completely cut off with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on an upper floor panicking the people on the street below about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communications around Palo, hampering authorities' rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
City Airport has reopened to humanitarian flights only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision staff safely arrived from Donggala in Palu, where employees were housed in tents erected in the office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction en route, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began to take the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign highly skilled humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says "okay, this is a national disaster", we'll be open to international assistance, but that status has not been declared yet.
As Palu falls into the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing are still hoping that their loved ones will be miraculously rescued and that their heartbreaking story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior member of the paragliding team I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to paraglider circles, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants in Palouse who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray button instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during a cash-filling at the Newport on the Levee complex
On Friday morning, the robbers reportedly stole $26,750 from a Brinks employee who was loading an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the statement said, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He will be known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's what we are.
It's evolved from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without a dash and in capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday that he would never use the military to subdue the Mexican people.
The military opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities pushed young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government issued announcements about artificial intelligence, although the United States generally has no official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the world's leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the AI budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the AI domain", Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to the top-ranked American Othello player, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they plan the next competitions where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to put in enormous effort to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"China is not taking away our academic leaders, it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant individuals from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States consolidate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to AI PhDs", he said.
China's State Council released its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation gives grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense formed the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Legislature, which has been trying to form a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence for months, is doing nothing.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of their northern neighbor represents an appropriation of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority in Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised questions about whether the referendum will yield the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely in the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have stated that they will be guided by the outcome of the vote and that the result will be decisive.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when a total of 66 percent of voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe", said Dzhose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a Macedonian referendum on changing the name, which could pave the way for them to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tent that was being hung by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not at the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor but proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote for it because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the ballot.
He said the result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll released Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it requires a turnout of 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to a pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Watch Manchester City player Sergio Aguero go through the whole Brighton defence and score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have got rid of Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win for Manchester City against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before he found himself in the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He got around one of the defenders and was faster than a few others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right hook overcame Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a goal to the right of the net.
Aguero had some foot problems, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the skyscrapers the initial edge in the Premier League storm.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's side of the field.
He's got Leroy Sane on the left flank.
He touched Sane a few times before he sent Sterling towards the goal.
The blue-eyed striker put the ball in the net before he slipped off the field.
City are facing Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a non-competitive game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated in the playoffs, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the field Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in the playoffs.
The Rockies at least have a direct pass to win the National 5-2 on Friday, but they're still trying to win their first league title.
Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team is probably going to be at the highest level of anything this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?
The Nationals still have to announce their starting lineup for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be starting a game for the 34th time, has been training Thursday and will pitch on Sunday when he's usually off.
The Washington right-hander leads the league at 18-7 this season for a 2.53 earned run average, 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president briefly reviewed the situation surrounding the election of his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican primary in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be on the line in November.
We're five weeks into the most important decisions of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones. Although I didn't run, I actually did run because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump went on, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using every means possible, you see, malice, dirty play.
They don't care who they hurt, who they trample to get power and control, power and control is what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission of resistance and disruption.
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, evil and dishonest".
He named Democratic Senator and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, a name that prompted a loud protest from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Ugh, uh, what?
No, no, wait. That was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
It's intolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local branch of the party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censors for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Party branch meeting held on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years I've spent as a local Labour MP, the Friday night meetings have been mostly just like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that, and the promise of a kinder, gentler policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues who I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to make 180-degree turns and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was on national security or the European Union's single market.
Every time I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, it's accompanied by a flurry of social media insults, calls for removal from the party, criticism of centre politics and being told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political in nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but don't back down.
One of the things that disappointed me most in this political age is how these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and every vote of no confidence or change in the party selection rules narrows it down.
I've been getting a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to keep my head down, be less vocal, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, which had literally collapsed my primary school classroom, I have striven to stand up for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would say that with the country on the verge of a Brexit that will threaten our households, jobs and public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political trickery will prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr took a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the home team won thanks to superior defense, as well as more chances taken, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"So far we've been tested in matches and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ay, with all due respect, they've taken their chances better than we have".
Grant Naderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors had allowed to play, allowed Melrose to take the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot caught the untamed attempt.
Climo had a penalty to increase Ayr's lead before, just before half-time, he scored a solo shot to turn it into a 17-5 half-time goal for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on stretchers, and Ayr then increased the lead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned the Climo.
Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again used his numerical superiority with an unadulterated attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts bounced back when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a foul on Clim without a ball.
Climo turned, as he's done almost since the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up a kick from David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent Greg Henry's wing for the fifth home run.

Still game star Ford Kieran is preparing to make the transition to the hospitality industry after learning he's been named CEO of a company that owns licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series for which he writes and stars alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters at La Paz.
Ocean-shaped flags are waving on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were rallied with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea".
Bringing the sea back is our duty.
Throughout mainland Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century war over natural resources and the desire to reclaim the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has caught the wind, in a spirit of unity and vigour, and of course it expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia and claim that after decades of heated negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election bid next year, also has a big stake in the verdict that will be handed down on Monday.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was handed down only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of making progress on the Bolivian case, the last four years may have set it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian authorities", Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has killed the rest of Chile's goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement to mutual satisfaction", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the issue of going to sea as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is a chance to realize that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea says it won't disarm until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will not denuclearize until they trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between the warring leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening stalled nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's just a wild dream that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not prepared to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which the country likely sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, the latest line of giant hats are on display, which you will soon see in the nearby shopping street.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shade yourself from the sun, you've come to the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of unwrapped giant hats on the runways of their 2019 spring and summer shows, shadowing everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unconventional hats have taken Instagram by storm this summer, and these designers have been showing off their impressive creations on the runways.
Valentine's most prominent piece was an over-the-top hat with a wide feathered rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other bulky additions include watermelons with gemstones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but they are not meant to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature resembled diving gear with a discharge and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're one of those people who's following the trend of attracting attention, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The giant hats came after La Bombe, the two-foot-wide straw hat seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that created this very unpractical hat that flooded social media has sent another huge creation to the track -- a straw bag that's almost as big as the model who wore it.
A bright orange raffia bag with stripes and a white leather lunch was a highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to hit stores in time for next summer, since the designer has left such a huge impression it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized fashion accessories".
Knowledge of language is crucial for citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland boast of outstanding academic achievement, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding exam results, further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, career choices and a place in the society of world citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable subject of choice for pupils in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it pleases his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the test scores this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A's on their high school final exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored A in Mandarin in the final high school exam, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electives, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in both independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of foreign language proficiency as the reason for their difficulty filling jobs.
So, foreign language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing number of potential jobs requiring foreign language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, knowing a second language will have a real advantage in the future because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a second language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in learning foreign languages is important for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to the language being taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages deemed more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a skilled teaching staff in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At this time, there is no denying that in the global business environment, languages are crucial for the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in a preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still unclear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games during the Lakers' preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of pre-election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings next week including visits to friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court is awaited, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, which have been fraught with sexual harassment allegations, and the anticipated Senate vote has been postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the overriding goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans get a better result in the November election.
So the Trump campaign said this week's rallies are being held to energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so key to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be identified told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to a report by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican nominee for the Senate from West Virginia, who's not doing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president came to try to raise his ranking in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed a fighting spirit to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's individual matches
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome on Saturday afternoon may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing is a completely invented concept in sports, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got the momentum?
"They're six points up, now four, so you could say the swing is on our side", Jordan Spieth said on the way out.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points up, with 12 more in play.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of a possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last shot and he's leading by example.
The roar of celebration grew louder during his round, until he finally played the decisive knock for the draw in the fourth match when he and Thomas were two behind by two.
His final blow to win the 15-hole match was met with a similar outcry, one that reflected the belief that there was hope for the American team.
"You just have to give it your best and take care of your game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that could bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but irresistible European pair won all four matches and played without a mistake.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't play bogey punches on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far and the way they exchange energy with the buzzing crowd have cemented their position as the main favourites on Sunday and no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari could deliver a potential European victory as the sun sets over the grounds of Le Golf National.
It'd be best if we both were in different holes at the same time.
However, it's too early to talk about a European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he was playing pair with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't even get out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
Four-ball and four-ball games are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead before the final day, but this four-man session also showed that the US team has a desire to fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe lead 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final Ryder Cup with a significant lead, having won the four-ball and foursome on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead with two wins over the restless Tiger Woods, increasing the previous record at Le Golf National to four points.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn, in their fight to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in a four-ball morning game and won the series 3-1.
The United States put up a stronger fight in the four-man tournament, winning two matches, but they couldn't close the gap.
Jim Fury's team must win eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they combined brilliantly to overcome the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5-4 victory.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, was a flash in the pan, but he's now lost 19 of 29 games in a four-ball, four-and-a-seven series.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning's four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four-ball tournament and suffered a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - first and third in the world.
Europe, however, did not go as planned on this pleasant sunny day southwest of Paris.
Triple-Major League champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point field goal for the Americans on Saturday.
They fought hard to beat John Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in a four-ball game, only to come back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the quarters, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points down in individual matches, although Fury's defending champions have a sufficient score to retain the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems they cannot make a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says there's no talk of unilateral disarmament unless there is trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances there is no way the country will unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures in the past year to show goodwill", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there has been no adequate response from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm".
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not dismiss unilateral denuclearization out of the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader held on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned a deaf ear to calls for international sanctions relief against North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up on denuclearization first and foremost" and is increasing the level of pressure with sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the wildest dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader had talked about at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we were negotiating this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill".
Yet the tone of Rio's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US ground-based missile strike on North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea carried out denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and uncompromisingly enforced until complete, final, verified denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions against North Korea, which have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riyadh outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, and North Korea convicted him of making "gangster demands" just hours later.
North Korea has promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile test site as well as its nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" required the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students to sleep more in an effort to root out the increasingly popular mačo culture of learning to sleep through the night with the help of caffeine.
One academic observed that students at the world's leading universities are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after a talk he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This year's first course will teach students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was noticed that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a room in the dorm, and students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In the second part, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We're aware that this won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what the health effects of your decision to smoke are", said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "night sweats" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Adequate sleep, and quality sleep, should be the secret weapon of students in fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, even against overweight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a starvation mode, so they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He says this course has opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for its maintenance on a campus-wide basis.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all postgraduates to undertake a similar programme of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider setting alarms at bedtime and waking time and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Meng's goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing defeat on the road when Dolly Mango sent a disastrous kick to Steven Gerrard's team in a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to pick up their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard as manager with just their second defeat in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premier League leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' uninspired lineup never came close to a tie.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth, Livingston have climbed to third and are behind Hibernian by only a goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to be assisted when he was hit by a side object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt is committed to the same 11 Livingston players who took the Hearts' point last week and would be delighted by the way his well-trained team has pressed their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
They were just two minutes away from scoring after Mengo's first over in the empty space sent Scott Pittman to score for Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a big chance and kicked a goal in the side.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to kick past the goal, near the stump.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their play in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have got a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers only conceded two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly defended Lassana Coulibaly's head shot without much trouble and managed to take the shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true power ratio of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if for nothing else, then for the effort put in.
The Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep free throw again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Mengo for the easy finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement was almost immediately effective when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to make the guests play just as they pleased, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor held on well and defended Jacobs' attack, only to have Lithgow head the ball from the corner to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for another penalty late in the game when he got caught with Jacobs, but Thomson again did not react.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a station from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become the device known as the Geiger counter.
As well as being one of the mainstays of science, the Geiger counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bell of the Coronade", starring seemingly incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms in your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.
Yeah, that's a lot of crap.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells as part of the therapy.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then see the protein that's common to many types of cancer and then re-inject it.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman's ovarian cancer, treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, has been gone for over 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient, re-engineering them in the lab so they can see the HER2 protein, and then re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute of Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "supports the growth of several types of cancer" including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and learning how to target malignant cells has been effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a fierce speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was interviewed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a heated performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night, wearing a "Make America Great" cap, he insulted the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to white people so many times, and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
So if I cared about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, a recording of West's speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes with the hat.
They made fun of me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on".
They were teasing me!
And then they say I'm a freak, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that he's going to wear Superman's cape because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and the SNL crew members were visibly affected, Variety reported, while one person present said: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West has confused many with his rendition of "I Love It" disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West was endorsed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU for NOT STOPING AGAINST THE RAPERS".
But the host Karen Hunt tweeted that West simply "did what he really is and it's absolutely beautiful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe has embraced and spread an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free to go.
And we are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder after a person was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in the Ballyhackamore neighborhood, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear in Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the state's attorney.
The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harington has condemned the toxic macho culture
Keith Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the swordsmith in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has lashed out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles mean that boys very often feel they have to be rude to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of a toxic macho culture in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Leslie Rose, 31, admitted he had a "strong need" to address the issue.
"I'm personally quite concerned at the moment with the question, 'What did we do wrong with the representation of manhood?' " he said.
What are we teaching men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we're seeing now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of the toxic macho culture by depicting characters who portray themselves as male.
He continued: "What is birth, and what is the matter of education?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that's actually one of the main questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because something obviously went wrong for the young man.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to any previews or sequels of the Game of Thrones series after its conclusion next summer, saying that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's play True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing that has ever happened in the Game of Thrones franchise.
"I met my wife on this show, so you could say she gave me a future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's parents' estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse, which is a change from the previous state.
Usually in the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative views in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The transmission of the virus is often also due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that any of her staff had released information on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that any of her staffers had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democratic congresswoman claims that these claims are being spread by experts and right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information leaked online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is linked to Waters' office and has posted information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely inaccurate and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"Any member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information".
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement soon sparked condemnation on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is breathing with rage", wrote Fleischer.
This leads to the conclusion that she lacks the temperament required for a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He can't be rude.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to criticism of Democratic Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also made the announcement via Twitter.
"Great thing if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the relevant institutions and judicial authorities" to these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and held accountable to the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English back in action, a soft spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to ask for a Brexit subtitle in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the Johnny English satirical action comedy franchise that began back in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to the screens in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Is the ironic auto satire about how useless we are going to be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the bulky, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face got another chance to blow something up, and his name more than anything implies that it's a general comic creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose native language is not English.
It's, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a Mr. Bean tray and a crumb of that guy who played just one note as part of the theme tune to the achievement "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It was also originally based on the traveller and international man shrouded in secrecy that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest J.E. venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing medieval knightly armor and the rotor blades briefly glared over his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor seems weak and very strangely redundant, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible are confidently adding comedic elements.
I'm assuming it's a children's comedy, not an adult one, and to me, Johnny English's wild adventures aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's Mr. Bean silent-film-style gags.
Now it's a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the horror of the agent on duty - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and arrogant character already experiencing complete collapse due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this character modeled after Theresa May, but the script is rather meager.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and that they will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the messy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but informally gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English holds a spy academy in the style of the movie "The School".
English is quickly sent back to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to reunite with his former immensely patient partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role as Vicki Pepperdine is little spent.
So Batman and Robin for Ruining Things are back in the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and luckily the beautiful and fateful wife of Opel Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comedic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, they create chaos by stealthily boarding Volta's luxury yacht, and English sets off a veritable anarchy by trying to get inside Volta's house using virtual reality headphones.
Obviously, a lot of effort was put into that last sequence, but as cute and fun as it was, the whole movie was like it was made for kids.
Pretty mediocre quality, you know.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry devise a role for Rowan Atkinson that really shows his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to make a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the bosses to pass on the time saved by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend but still receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to set out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of the shoddy CEOs and the profiteers in the utilities.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their full investments because Labour could impose "debt" based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy talking to 60 Minutes about whether an FBI investigation might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and withdraws the question of whether the bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think so, of course", said Kennedy.
Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unambiguous.
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be cemented.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is formed and a strong indictment would be required", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has energetically denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever she's naming can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the World Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars performing, and an equally impressive goal of ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together on the vast Central Park lawn to not only enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Anti-Poverty Project, an international group that advocates for ending poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "things", such as volunteer, send an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call, and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizen of the World project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to get people to do something, or just another form of so-called "cliqueism" where people believe they've done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizen of the World initiative claims to have recorded more than 19 million shares of its supporters who have championed a range of causes.
They say these actions have prompted world leaders to issue pledges and policy directives worth more than $37 billion and affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 pledges and announcements stemming from its shares, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly impacted 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are Power of Food, a partnership of UK investors and developers who pledged to help children grow to their full potential, pledging to allocate $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historic event", said Ambassador for Food Power, Tracey Ullman, to a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund the Power of Food project, whose interventions will save the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, which is, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world replies: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russia's energy exports.
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, revealed Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of the Interior, and reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian involvement in Syria - namely, at the invitation of the legitimate government there - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and central southern Europe", he is reported to have said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has this ability to work with our Navy to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or blockade them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared the approach of Washington to relations with Russia and Iran, concluding that they are the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels", he said, saying that Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The comments come after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, which presents a far more favorable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to the project are purely economic in nature and that it represents an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose their suppliers", Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, said Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the next midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren called out President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was called in because of criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet released Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, poll results released Thursday showed that a majority of the electorate that voted for Warren did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters who are "likely" to vote in Massachusetts said that a senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent backed the nomination.
The poll showed there was greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
Other big names from the Democratic Party that have been discussed in terms of their potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD to a Trump supporter.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident that occurred Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he returns, I can relate to what's happening to other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and the vulnerability that our troops are coming back with", she told an audience at a rally in support of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "hot topic", and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, she added, "They're coming back a little different, they're coming back stronger, they're coming back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assaulting a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of opium, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenging the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a review of the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friendly brief in Washington on Friday to provide support for asylum seekers who challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full names of the plaintiffs in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal law enforcement have not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and violent members of his gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She's being held in a Texas detention center.
State attorneys for Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are home to large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, are facing a growing problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
"District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claims, and in doing so the Chamber is violating that principle", the friendly report states.
Lawyers further argue in the report that police who block immigrants from entering the United States are harming the economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and secure the necessary labor force.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered judges in immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available only to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or social group, or because of their political opinion", Sessions said in a June 11 statement about the policy.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even the serious ones, that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the death toll doubles in the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance is bringing bodies.
The government's shortage of clean water".
Residents are returning to their destroyed homes, searching for flooded things trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals have been devastated by the 7.5 magnitude quake, which is overwhelming.
Some of the injured, like Dwy Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, are being housed outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the continuing strong aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he tells how he felt a powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of "propaganda violence"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid addition of the Chinese newspaper China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marks, US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
And while it's common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war where each other raises tariffs on imports.
As a countermeasure, previous Chinese tariffs in this trade war have targeted exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime mayor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary published in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling down on that violence by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's precious traditions of free speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, at the kiosk located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's troubled economic path, given that the Chinese media is under the tight grip of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are discouraging women from voting ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
Analysts have warned that many of the most prominent Republicans defending and supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, will experience negative reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and a majority of Republicans are already showing interest in casting their votes.
There's no going back on these things", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in a magazine article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute request by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to pursue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news.
People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 who, although they don't like the president, don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed the alleged sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts were of the opinion that there could be a backlash if the Republicans pressed for the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also the way Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the Democratic nomination, told the news channel.
Still, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, slightly leaning towards Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who has made the accusation, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was world domination.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of them available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about a personal online data store is that it's completely dependent on the user who can access what kinds of information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of employed development engineers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology engineers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
While running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter has been staged in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29th, 1918 for his attack on the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was shot by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military award.
At a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a very dense fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine gun fire".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest heroism" led the squad forward before he, without any help, rushed to the Polish cannon and slaughtered three of the military detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that challenges obedience".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead got Pepa Pig
Imagine that, staying up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches, only to end up unable to watch the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and was broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the broadcast of Pepa Pig was interrupted.
Many were not impressed at all by the fact that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning precisely because of the fight.
One fan on Twitter described this cartoon interruption as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government regulation that says at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a program for kids", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig", that's what.
Bellator president Scott Coker said he's working on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about re-enactment, I think we can probably work it out", Coker said.
But the transmission is there at six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday, when it's Monday at their place.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the breakup happened, there was correspondence and everyone was hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't. It was a matter for the government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're gonna cut the number of fights from six to five, like we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that everyone was like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presentation by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the program, Kirsty Young, has been out of the house for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on the first episode of Laverne, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because it was "no longer socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and the feeling of being different have been the real things that have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was a "Neko", he said, so people wouldn't be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a very important advocate for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "had taken him by surprise".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, and he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age" - he first appeared in the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about winning the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie".
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't gonna be there to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It served as the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him as he prepared for the Olympics and from which he still gets his winkles.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson off the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid this unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial for a record 12th time, has been sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S., the five-time major winner spent the day cheering and improving the game's range, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding terrain of Le Golf Nationala, where a long, uneven course regularly punishes stray shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is up against British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 games out, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk said he had faith in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of faith in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine he was playing two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's the way it was, and we thought that's the way it had to be.
He wants to be there, just like everybody else".
Mickelson is set to surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team", he explained.
I think it was fun for the younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a puck game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his first appearance in a match played in Valderrama in 1997, when the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished the competition with a close 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won", Bjorn said, reflecting on watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win this trophy and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side of the road - the greatest players in the world".
Enthusiastic about his players' performance in a tough golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this get me down.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's the singles game, and that's another thing.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you test your ultimate potential as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he's got to do his best too".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will be asking his players to play better singles than they did in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Suryk himself was on both ends of those big turns on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as the loser after Europe performed the "miracle" in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, cheered his players up before his final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the start of the match like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When he starts with a rush like that, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've formed our lineup accordingly and we've prepared the guys so we can try to perform a little magic tomorrow, you know.
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half.
"I went out with this group of guys in this outfit because I think she can cover all the way", Bjorn said of choosing singles players.
New German warship on standby again
The new German Navy frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system failures and overhead, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the class of all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class Navy ships ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to deploy for up to two years without returning to home ports.
Yet, continuing delays mean that the most advanced warships, which were supposed to enable Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125's unfortunate fate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to allow the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the recall, but German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make the ship unusable if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half the number of men who operated the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship turned out to be considerably overweight which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary committee on defence, admitted that the navy is in fact running out of ships that can be deployed".
The official said that the problem has grown over time, as old ships have been scrapped and no replacement ships have been purchased.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
A new study conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of solitary flying mammals and serve as a guide for future conservation activities.
A study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bat and the soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long-tailed bat and the Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be set up at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A professional analysis of the recordings of all the records will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what they do and what species.
Then a habitat map and report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which negatively affects spawning and habitat loss.
Ventilators and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct checks, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a large bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good living quarters.
But there's so much more unknown about bats, so what we're doing here and on other farms is going to help us better understand what they need to move forward.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats on the property, since accidental destruction of one moth's nest may kill up to 400 females and young, likely to lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass, harass or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the populations of most of our species are evolving".
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers in a video on Instagram Live, hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they said today, that's fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's the way it is.
They want to make a name for themselves by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
"Counsel Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for non-material damage "in an amount commensurate with the severity of the injury, "probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 99% good guy who was let down by those 1%
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital photographed her injuries, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retribution" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she's now seeking a plea deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
The UK will "ever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" what Toyota UK had told the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement it would temporarily halt production at its Burnston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnston plant that makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a halt in production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers call the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "Right-On-Time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be a disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan Theresa May is offering for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border.
"We want to make the best deal that will allow us to, as I say, not only enjoy the success we have now, but also to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of continuing what has been a highly successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and is president of the Unite union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this are closed, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We must come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
"A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week "as the fight continues over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the case of Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mr. Mueller's independence, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, amid rumors that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting was called with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh within a week, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The date is not set yet, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I like the press to be kept informed.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not given a brief press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lower number of briefings was not due to disgust with the "theatrical behavior" of TV reporters, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they exaggerate".
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be intensified.
"The president has held more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, without citing evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
The briefings will continue, Sanders said, but since the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that as much as we can, and you've seen us do that over the last couple of weeks, and these interviews with the president of the United States will replace the brief press conferences".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during official visits.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, by behaving before a gathering of reporters with an unrestrained and occasionally bizarre demeanor.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about the concerns surrounding Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimbursement of the costs of resolving the status requirements of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The UK-EU withdrawal talks have continued over the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very, very turbulent time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and advance the work of health services, to the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He got to the line of scrimmage and just just crashed right there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before they put him on a stretcher and took him away for further questioning.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the nature/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being taken out of the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher fees when buying property in the UK, with the extra funds going to help the homeless under the new Conservative plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in trying to lure young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing care and target those earning more.
Higher taxes will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money to strengthen the government's intention to fight outdoor sleeping.
The additional charge, which is in addition to the existing tax, including several levels, introduced two years ago on second property and purchases for rent, could amount to as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to raise revenues to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to become homeowners.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people get to their first homes.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land they don't use at the first opportunity, and urged Mrs May to give up her quota for affordable housing as soon as possible to end Britain's "shameful housing policy".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including a rental control and a halt to unnecessary evictions.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - that life for every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life in it.
However, it cannot be right that non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes as easily as the British.
The dream of owning a home has become too distant for many people, and the inhumanity of sleeping outdoors remains very real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to be manager of the Scottish national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of bringing back the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I was in the B-team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always brought me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be offered if I was successful in running the club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Cano.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel uneasy coming from such a big name to such a big club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of my success at this point will be 'do I manage to get this club back into the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back where it belongs.
Ross is only in his third year of managing, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and St Mirren pulled off the brink of relegation to the Championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he's feeling more comfortable than he's ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, remembering the takeover of the Alloa Club.
I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living and enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
So much to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and I'm doing it now, and I've never felt more comfortable in my whole adult life".
The full interview can be heard on the Sportsound programme on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland from 12pm to 1pm UK summer time.
The perfect time for a drink is Saturday at 5:30, research shows.
The summer heat wave has boosted the traffic of Britain's struggling pubs, but it has added pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw sales increase by 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic fell by 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, from the consultancy CGA, which collected the data, said: "The continued sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern to the previous June, when pubs grew by 2.8%, and restaurants had an even bigger decline.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant traffic in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved by far the best result with a higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than was the decline in restaurant traffic.
Food-focused pubs have also been hit by the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
Pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in drink sales in one month, with food sales down 3%.
Paul Newman, of the entertainment and hospitality analytics agency RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the impact of the measures on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant groups continue to struggle hard, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful with the already present price pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little over-needed relief.
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower growth in the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry-leading sales tracking service for the UK bar, pub and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an accepted industry benchmark.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they're hiding from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers, a study reveals.
A study of over 20,000 elementary school seniors found a rise in the number of fake Instagram sites
This news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "master account" that showed their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social networking accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 elementary school seniors found a surge in fake Instagram accounts, which refers to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had clean main accounts that they showed to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenage girl who calls others "rape me".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her rich experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys the highest regard in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her membership of the board", Beattie said.

The American, who won a total of four Olympic golds, including victories in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and is now a regular expert on the BBC, has been left immobile after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time could tell if I'd recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!

An ad for a traitor comparing mothers to cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that makes the traitor shares its views on the Internet with an advertisement comparing the millers to the slaughter cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as the "first silent milk vendor", consumer technology firm Elvie has released an ad inspired by a hilarious music video that shows the freedom the new pump provides mothers who give milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn amongst the hay and cows to a song that says, "Yes, I'm getting married but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a whim, it's my breasts".
The chorus is: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, husband myself".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it shed light on the dairy industry's shadows.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth like we do to produce milk, but they're deprived of their babies a few days after birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's delivery pump is discreetly placed in the breast-feeding bra.
Someone else commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use it to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "The ads were pointless".
Others stood in defense of the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "urnebes" (or "crazy").
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy this if I was still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel like a cow.
The commercial was a little silly, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous advertisement aimed at mothers who give milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
This is not an ad that praises or flatters the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of the ad is based on the knowledge that many mothers who give milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely inert, has no wires or pipes, and stands in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they're feeding.
Anna Ballin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between a suckler and a cow mussel, we wanted to focus on the milk supply and all the challenges that come with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway in a Martha Jakubowska design using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most caregivers and themselves have been undocumented migrants who are afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping out to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to give fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior convictions.
About 80% of the people who are either caregivers or members of the household of a caregiver are in this country illegally, and a good portion of them are foreigners who have committed criminal offenses.
So we're going to continue to search for these people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, said the shelter workers.
Many will respond by video call rather than in person, to seek legal status from an immigration judge.
Those found to be unqualified will be deported quickly.
The longer children are kept in the shelter, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempted escape, shelter workers and reports from the system over the past few months have pointed out.
Lawyers say such risks are heightened in larger institutions like the one in the city of Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook signs that a child is in trouble.
They add that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say hello to friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria is demanding the immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in that country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they will be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said at the hearing.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, the War on Terror is almost over, where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue its "scientific struggle" until we eliminate all Syrian terrorists, including terrorist groups and any foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, tasked primarily with training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be exterminated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, saying that the body's work should be limited to "consideration of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of outside interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal terminate his term earlier.
That would undoubtedly represent the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!
So far, there's no sign of any spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings on the hit-date have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers on the air, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show topped cable's ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the air in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama "The Chosen Survivors", about the secretary of state who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of Just Funny Parts: And Some Raw Truths About Getting In the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was voting for Trump.
She asked why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs Scovell told me.
Chaos has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington can decide the future of the Roe v. Wade abortion laws, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and what the state of the global economy will be.
Shutting down is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you've gone a little further than the general information when you realize that you've spent six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used deep-backed sources for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket, and the implications of pictorial descriptions, this one, of Mr. Trump's anatomy, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what it does to make you feel like a reality show is to feed you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of The Zagat Room, commenting on the rotation of the cast and the daily plot of the Trump show (criticising the American Football League, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' house this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of the island of Kauai, with temperatures of about 80 degrees, but he locked himself in and watched MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and while his future on the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember back in the day when we did all these crazy shows, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' " Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

A huge influx of money from the outside in the most uncertain midterm race for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a cash flow, thanks to congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
The recent redrawing of the Pittsburgh suburb's county boundaries led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who came to lead the second district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally formed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the party's main fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a widely watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then backs down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties are only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be hard to hit in this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a continuation of a similar meeting last year that represented a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and had effectively stopped any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Mr. Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The story
Next up could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible Trump obstruction of justice, which now has substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly focused his investigation on uncovering a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attacks on the election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body just as he prepares to stand before the voters again, and perhaps a jury.
There are many such "like" and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump, or those in Europe like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only to be opposed by the West and backed by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing multiple such tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a precarious position since this paper reported last year that he had proposed secretly filming the president and made speculations that he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' testimony is inaccurate.
How do we react if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite compelling sexual assault and perjury charges?
And on top of that, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that Mr. Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we won't fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the cork cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing Rapid from Vienna
Rangers are on Thursday hosting Rapida from Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented striker Graham Dorrance from making his debut this season until the draw with Villarreal, which ended 2-2, but he is confident the Rangers can use that as a springboard for the rest of the season.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something done and we went with a point.
Maybe we could have taken them all the way, but all in all, the unresolved outcome is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second and we were better.
We're back to the big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result last game, although, with the support of the crowd, we can definitely push and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one, from everything that happened with my injuries to the changes at the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have.
The team is in good shape and the guys are really enjoying themselves; we're training well.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep worrying about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their kids about it.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation about it", says Holly Snyder, senior vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care for you unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to consider where and how you can get it, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy that would help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own savings  provided you have enough money.
Fix your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Make a decision-making authority on medical care so that you have an authorized person of trust who will oversee the medical care that is provided to you and ensure that health care professionals act according to your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also entering into a financial power of attorney agreement.
It means you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and see to it that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aging parent is in an emergency and needs to be taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please include details in your written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it out.
Man shot multiple times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times by an air rifle as he walked home from an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. British time, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As the communication was cut off, emergency officials could not get any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively lower ranked than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the deadly devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su detention unit and has been granted a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated related to the incident.
His girlfriend testified that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There have been power outages and power outages, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was just off the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare execution for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists who had crossed his path in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points are possible for the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferrucci, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca", the motion for a writ of certiorari states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment states.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag raised in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting life in prison without the possibility of parole for a guilty plea, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must have felt the displeasure of Eurosceptics, as one of MEPs, Theresa May, had suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May has faced in trying to unite her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by the Remain Conservatives, who have joined a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to hold on to her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks from both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted that she continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the meeting that leaving means going to Solihull to get rid of the Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out Chequers".
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and voted for us.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening.
In a strong message, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told the audience that politicians must be forced to feel dissatisfied if they are prepared to defy the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people and our political elite", he said.
They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that you're not going to get away with it.
In a message to the delighted audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel dissatisfied.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory anti-Brexit banners after forming a group this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they had with the party's app at the opening of the conference.
"These are people telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plus plan, for unimpeded border conditions, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a complete sham.
A good Brexit is not possible, he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a participatory meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican House Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using a participatory meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren has said it's time for women to come to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge.
Arrest after LSU's Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. at a press conference.
A video of the shooting was released Friday, asking for help in finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closing in on the world title after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the lineup of teams would play a big part in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton behind to join the traffic at the start, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel by wheel which made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the interior free at the risk of being left behind after a double move in the third-turn defence.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race relying on his tyres to get to the fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the pits on lap 44, but failed to pick up pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Waltery spent the whole weekend doing a fantastic job and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did a really great job of getting one or two formations", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinsten at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, disobedient and liars".
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disobedient and lying", he said.
When you look at the ads and information that's been leaked to the public, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information to the public?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document to the public- but what?
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't release it.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - yet Feinstein denied that information had leaked from her office.
I didn't withhold the allegations from Dr. Ford, I didn't release her story to the public. " Feinstein told the board, reports Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, as she asked.
But her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual assault, the president implied that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see the anger, the spite, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get to power and control,
The elite league, Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants, 3 to 1.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have made up for their defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win in a replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead early on with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lucas Lunwald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwayer opened the scoring in the fourth minute, 3:35, with Kendall McFaul's assist, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the initial rush, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead by the first break with his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard led them once again to a goal-scoring draw in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored a fifth goal in the middle of the final period to secure his team's victory.

An air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board the plane escaped the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller declared a hero after he died securing a safe take-off for a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu Airport which was rocking violently.
He stayed to ensure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reports.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"Our hearts are broken over this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the state disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to be still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many are inaccessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached heights of up to 20 feet devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She was driving an ambulance every minute the body was brought in.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working in a hurry to provide assistance to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reporting.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one face is reported missing.
The airline whose plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that they have not been able to track the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane overran the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane was very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through to the emergency exit through water that sucked up to their waist in a sinking plane.
He said the crew were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby repairing the harbor also helped rescue passengers by using inflatable boats to get them ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that none of these have involved Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office on Saturday concluded a re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified before the jury that he used cell phone data to piece together a picture of the movements of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod stated that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was Tellis's assertion that he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett is that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life", Halle declared.
The defense should begin with the closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to follow later in the day.

Another black person?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing them after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "just another black person".
The couple denies being racist, calling the lawsuit "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016 to find that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"Never a single black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job and was expecting a Filipino instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work and sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay, as well as compensation of $350 a day for six months, which is what she was originally hired to live with her family, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you can't do things like that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism by saying that cancelling Mauric's engagement was reasonable because they were afraid that after they had insulted her they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists", he told the Post husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you trust your children to someone you have offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you know what?
Describing the lawsuit as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice, he added, an investment banker.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not identify with the talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
Saying that her father, who, before he was inspired to write a children's book by a little teddy bear, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with both happiness and sadness following his death last year.
She also said that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of it, even though it wasn't really your credit.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was in bad shape, and that they did not expect him to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that and everything went out.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be collected.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of the agony she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I nodded and tears flowed down my face.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Sad women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes are on the Welsh Bridge, putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with an infectious laugh.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
However, before his death he left the job because he was in a "very dark phase".
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I keep worrying about the consequences.
Mrs. Davis designed these cards so people would know there's someone you can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit and be silent - talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was moody or depressed or anything", she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the bottom of the Christmas tree - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: "It leaves a huge void in the family.
It divides us.
But we're going to keep going and fight.

With the opening of the FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
"I thought that if we could really get something out of what he was asking for - an investigation of limited duration and scope - maybe it would bring us together somewhat", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the board was "disintegrating" because of irreconcilable partisan attitudes.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their distress is caused by the choice of the moment.
Congressional elections are in just five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans do badly, as expected, their attempts to get their man elected to the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush on Saturday telephoned the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast his vote to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is declining under Kim.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug said that 1,127 escapees were recorded last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often sends them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where a broad consensus was reached to work on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress so far on US sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm first", RI said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called "hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and coughing when he talked about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, considering the allegations against him a "grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself by his statements and the way he's gone about it against the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she'd try to impeach Kavanaugh if he's confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about the possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roe v. Wade, because they consider him a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would alter certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to stand in court and be expected to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?' " Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justified anger, a rage that's been building up for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without paying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, what are you saying?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere a CEO, and she said that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique that she re-imagined that when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great.
Tears are a permissible way to vent anger in part because they're fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my earlier work, in an office that was mostly male, was that one day, as I was crying in an indescribable rage, an older woman - a cold boss whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"I never let them see me cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Moneky Business in 1987 and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had already moved on, she was behind on fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger at chauvinism - that it went right down her throat.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled, "how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my headstone?
"Did she cry?"
How a U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first cannonade of the US-China trade war has been deafening, and while the end of the battle is not yet in sight, the rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest blow came this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion worth of items, taxing virtually half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated with the same measure each time, most recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed that the US will respond with the same measure, and the world's second largest economy doesn't seem to be going to a standstill anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means complying with demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, the US's entrance into the trade war could in the long run positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of a major economic downturn in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have believed", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister says.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Six million more people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had helped the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish team captained by Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling throughout the tournament, kicked the ball into the water on the 16th par 3 hole, giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in this format in 1997.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked player on a European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England for whom this may have been his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the all-time European tournament winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
"It's a big team here and I'm glad I could be of help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the relay to his countryman John Ram who beat legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 major titles and is trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find their way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there were moments when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're out of business.
