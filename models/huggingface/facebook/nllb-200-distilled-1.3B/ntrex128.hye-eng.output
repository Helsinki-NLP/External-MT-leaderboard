Members of the Welsh Assembly were worried about being seen as puppets.
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposed renaming of the MWPs.
This proposal was prompted by a change in plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that he may be ridiculed in the political arena.
One of the assembly workers said that his group was worried because the name change was due to Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means crazy.
One member of the Welsh Assembly Party (Plaid Cymru) says the group is not happy and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative says his group is biased about the name change, but notes that the puppeting of Welsh MPs was a short leap of oral thought.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing to introduce legislation on name changes, said: "The final decision on any attribution of the names of the members of the Assembly should of course be the responsibility of the members.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received wide support to name the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
The Assembly's (AMs) naming committee supported the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but from the open consultation the MWP received the most support.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presiding official, Ellen Jones, who is likely to introduce a bill on the amendment in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on legislative amendments will also include other changes to the Assembly's working methods, including the rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will get a final vote on what to call them when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians have launched a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was supposed to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has repeatedly applied to the EU and NATO for membership.
President of Macedonia Georgi Ivanov, the opponent of the name change referendum, said he would cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the renaming is merely a rent for joining the EU and NATO.
As tensions between churches in Harlem mounted, the bells of St. Martin's fell silent
"The adults I spoke to said that historically, every corner had a café and a church", said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them exist.
He said the disappearance of coffee shops was understandable.
"In our time, people communicate in different ways", he said.
Cafes are no longer the neighborhood living room where people go on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the profits from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that sooner or later they will return to where they started.
"Churches", he added, "can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who won't help the shrines in their neighborhood".
"The vast majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who move into these properties will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregants before the Metropolitan community became the black capital of Harlem in 1870, and a decade later, St. Martin's was built.
In the 1930s, the real white Methodist Conference was kicked out.
The black congregation that worshiped in the neighborhood became the name of the building.
St. Martin was captured by black conventionists led by the saintly John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the retail boycott on 125 Main Street in Harlem, himself opposed to hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but since Father Johnson's smokers were planning to rebuild it, they were commissioned to purchase bells.
St. David Jones, son of Father Johnson and rector of St. Martin's, proudly calls the bells the bells of the poor.
The expert who rang the bells in July called them "cultural treasures" and "replaceable historical tools".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be rung by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who replaced the bell with a larger one 18 years ago in a Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin wasn't going to replace him.
What's happened around St. Martin's over the past few months has been a tangled story between architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, some by the Episcopal team.
The Council of Elders, the church's governing body, wrote to the church in July, concerned that it would try to avoid spending, despite the fact that the Council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the jury.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who was diving to catch a shark
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving on the opening day of the California shark season, the official statement said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Bacon Coast of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I've been bitten".
- I got bit.
"His arm was completely torn", said Hamel, "and he didn't notice it until he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water". "There's a shark in the water", added Hamel.
He was flown to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
The type of shark that was attacked was unknown.
At a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said the shark had been in the area for weeks, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the face.
Officials have closed the entrance to the coast of Etnia from Casablanca Ponto to Swamy for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are being introduced to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is the beauty salon for the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams brands, along with professional assistants.
As part of a significant £2.8 billion investment in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and homewares sales decline, large beauty salons will be piloted in 11 stores across the country, with more stores moving in next year if successful.
The investment in beauty came about when supermarkets started looking for ways to make better use of the space for TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double in size, offering up to 3,000 beauty products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more branded space, as is the case with Boots.
The supermarket is also re-releasing its makeup line of boutiques so that most of the products are plant-based, which is a growing demand among young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Craydon, South London, and the other last year at Sale Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping, and the shift to buying small amounts of food at local convenience stores on a daily basis, means that supermarkets have a lot of work to do to convince people to visit.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coop said the stores would be seen as a "universal" as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and no groceries.
Sainsbury's set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and also introduced a number of Habitats brands, until two years ago it bought both chains, which, in its own words, boosted sales of groceries and made its acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
In early 2000, Sainsbury's tried to form a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended in a dispute over how to divide the revenues from their supermarket drug stores.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125 million to Selesio, who owned the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyd was expected to play a major role in this programme, adding luxury skincare to its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hick, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said, "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty salons, and we've added a different flavor to enhance the aesthetics for our customers.
We also invested and trained special partners who would be able to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every demand, and the attractive environment, along with the convenient location, means that we are now a glamorous beauty center, which in turn challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is outraged after Holly Wilba's £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, was furious when TV presenter Holly Wilby walked out of her lifestyle business for £11 million to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wilby had no time to deal with Truly, a brand of homewear and accessories.
The couples business has become similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old news anchor posted on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Wilby left the lucrative lifestyle business with Peter Jones of Dragons Den at the last minute to focus on her new, larger-scale contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the television golden girl announced her new £1.5 million deal at their Buckinghamshire business headquarters in Marlow on Tuesday, meaning she no longer has enough time to supply their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was modelled on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aimed to double Wilba's £11 million in future.
When 37-year-old Wilby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK and headed to one of his summer camps.
"Truly was the top priority for Holly.
That's going to be his long-term future, which will ensure he sees through the next few dozen seconds.
His decision to leave was obviously a shock.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's head full of goods ready to go.
Experts believe the This Morning presenter, who is considered one of Britain's richest stars, will cost the company millions in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homeware, as well as delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
The Wilbains' mother of three and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about a decade.
Wilby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, became chairman in March.
The husbands are resting together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Wilby was to become the M&S brand ambassador and was to replace Ant McPartley as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We're not going to comment on any business matters".
After a difficult conversation, we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news for a comment that many would consider presidential and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in his typical sarcastic news anchor voice:
- I didn't give anything away.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting when, after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, Trump considered North Korea's denuclearization a big step.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "serious response" from the United States to North Korea's rushed denuclearization.
Instead, he noted that the US continued to apply sanctions to maintain the tension.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
- We have a great relationship with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these great relationships", he said.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had paid off, ending missile tests, helping to free foreign hostages, and finally bringing American troops home.
And he kept his unusual approach when talking to Kim about relationships.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed space, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national pandemic was declared that would be a prerequisite for international humanitarian assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it's pretty clear that they won't ask for international assistance, so it's a little complicated", Ms. Sambog said.
While Save the Children is recruiting a team to travel to Palo, they are still not so sure that the foreign staff can work on site.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to ensure whether international agencies would be allowed to conduct relief efforts.
Given that Indonesia is constantly being shaken, however, the country remains unprepared for the elements.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning and even warning in Palou probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travel between Indonesia's many islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make the supply even more difficult.
A relief ship based in Lambo, which was providing aid to earthquake victims, is heading to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's fragile infrastructure a top priority of his election campaign, and also spent money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is a concern for Mr. Yoko's administration, as he is up for re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also has problems with inter-faith tensions in Indonesia, where most Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and over 10,000 people were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using guns, arrows, bows and other heavy weapons.
Look, Daniel Starridge of Liverpool has tied the game against Chelsea.
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from relegation in the 89th minute of a Premier League match against Chelsea.
Sturridge received the ball from Hedran Shakir 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before it hit the goal.
The test shot was a little bit higher than the gate because it went through the top right of the gate.
Finally the ball came down the side of the bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the goal.
"I was just trying to get to that position to get to the ball, but players like Shaq always get there as fast as possible, so I tried to buy as much time as possible for myself", Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I noticed as I approached Kante, I touched the ball a little bit, without thinking too much about it, and I just hit it.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 when Belgian star Eden Hazard opened the scoring in the 25th minute.
In that game, before the Blues striker reached the centre of the field and caught Liverpool's goal from a short distance, he sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic.
The quarterback made a quick pass back and forth in the center of the field.
Then he scored a great goal for the goal, towards Hazard.
Hazard came out of the backfield and completed the attack on the left wing, passing the ball to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
On Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage.
On Thursday at 15:00 in London, Chelsea will play Videotone in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The country's disaster relief agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
At a press conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugroho said that many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Friday with waves as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palo, with a population of over 380,000, was left in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing and killing a woman
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was discovered at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people who saw or heard anything in the area to report it.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to urge anyone who has witnessed or heard anything suspicious about the incident in John Street Brickenhead to contact us.
I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on video cameras, to contact us if they have information that is very important to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the identity of the woman whose body was found at her home in Birkenhead.
Friends of the woman who knew her arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where the body was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are in the process of notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose was trying to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take hours before they were allowed back into their homes.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, crying.
He kept saying how terrible it was.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the cordon, and another outside.
There were a few policemen standing inside the cordon, guarding the apartments.
Please contact anyone with information about the incident by personal email @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crime Prevention Center anonymously on 080055111 with the number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's half-way house in Parliament, rewriting history for debate, becomes the historic final hit
His exile would be a poetic justification for the Taliban's destruction of Britain's cultural and spiritual artworks by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Union described Mr. Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The discussion of the removal of the statues now outside the Palace of Westminster is bound to become a half-hearted goal of Oliver Cromwell.
The ideas behind the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor instigated by Cromwell.
Perhaps, in the last century, the wrong Cromwel was sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tronicroft is proof of a figure that is still held in high esteem by many in 19th century opinion and historical review.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by many, certainly more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate reproduction is still subject to ongoing historical debate.
It's remarkable that the mid-17th century confrontation shaped the course of our nation, and Cromwell is a personally recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as a master-keeper are also worthy of appreciation and mention.
A murderous pig brutally kills a Chinese farmer
Local Chinese media reports say a farmer in a southwest market was attacked and killed by a pig.
A man named Yuan was found dead near the Liupangshi market in the Gichou suburb of Liang on Sunday, his breathing was cut off and he was covered in blood, reports the South China Morning Post.
A farmer was about to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, in the Qinghai suburb of Xinjiang, China.
On Wednesday, he went with his cousin to the neighboring suburb of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the neighbor's pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
According to the report, the coroner's report confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My nephew's knees were bloody and broken", said the nephew, whose last name is Wu.
Security cameras caught Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan was neither his own nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking it until police gathered evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are negotiating compensation for his death.
In the past, there have been rare cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was fed his own pigs. A farmer in Manitoba told CBC News: "Pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can make them stop".
They just like to play.
They're like babies, very curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of attention.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest United States
As predicted, moving over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico, Storm Rosa is receding.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa was at 85 miles, a Category 1 storm, located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a current is forming over the Pacific Ocean, and it's moving from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. Because on Monday, Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula as a tropical wind, it will bring moisture from the north to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, interacting with the waterfall, will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest in the coming days.
On a local scale, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause flooding, landslides and possible landslides.
The deep tropical humidity will cause two to three inches of rainfall per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible in severe weather conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely bad advice to walk in the desert in the face of impending tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canals into rivers, and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust.
The approaching waterfall will cause heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
A half-inch of rain could be the cause of small debris flows and road slides.
This will be the first heavy rainfall in the region this wet season.
Some tropical drizzle will begin to move into Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before rains become more common on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Tuesday's heavy rain will spread to the four corners of the country and continue until Wednesday.
In the United States, you can see some intense temperature fluctuations in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay quite warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, we have a good example of temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to spread again.
In October, mild temperatures (about 80 degrees) are expected in the central and eastern United States from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
Tuesday night in New York City, temperatures could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there's a good chance that by the first half of October, the eastern United States will have above-average weather.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh auditions
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television networks the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued when broadcasters stopped regular broadcasts at the last minute on Friday, with Arizona Senator Jeff Blake agreeing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) should conduct a week-long audit of spending.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had drunkenly attacked him and tried to take off his shirts at his high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh testified that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it was probably watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that were showing it, the ratings were not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the statistics of people watching from their office.
In this sense, the audience is the same as the number of people watching a football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose public opinion guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, leads all networks with an average daily audience of 5.9 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained high.
Flake was central to Friday's tragedy.
After the Republican office announced its vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras turned on the protesters on Friday morning as he tried to climb the elevator into the Judiciary Committee hearing room.
During a live CNN broadcast, he stood there for a few minutes with his eyes on the ground because he felt a little bit annoyed.
- I'm standing right in front of you.
- Do you think he's telling the world the truth?
They said, "You have power where many women have no power", said one woman.
Flake said his office had spread the word, and before the elevator doors closed, he said he had a lot more to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks later did live coverage when the Judiciary Committee had to notify the Senate of the vote on Kavanaugh's nomination.
But Flake said he would only do so if he understood the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partially convinced after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and later many other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have a vote to confirm Kavanaugh without investigations.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit on the criticism of politicians
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times blames her plans to leave the European Union on criticism from politicians who say it is a blow to national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham, UK to attend the Conservative Party conference.
On the front page of the paper, in another interview with him, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his displeasure with his so-called Brexit inspectors' plan, presenting his proposal that Britain and the EU should join forces to be more prosperous.
Police have arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a baseball player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
According to a news release from the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
The official video of the confrontation between Simpson and Sims has been released, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a CBS enterprise WAFB report, police recovered the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he had confessed to the crime.
According to the attorney's statement, his share was $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a preliminary statement saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern Police University and the community for their assistance in the investigation of the arrest.
Joe Aleva, the athletic director at LSU, thanked law enforcement for their hard work and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was very tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "terrified and shocked" by the news of Wade's death.
"That's what's always bothering you", said Wade.
The volcano has released a cloud of gray smoke over Mexico.
Smoke from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
On Saturday, after recording increased activity in the volcano's crater and 183 gas leaks in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The center was in control of multiple explosions and tremors.
Social media images from the neighboring Mexican city of Choshimilco show thin layers of smoke covering the windshields of cars.
Since the magnitude 7.1 quake that struck central Mexico in September 2017, geologists have been detecting activity near the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The Don Gio volcano has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters clashed with police as thousands of people joined opposing protesters to mark Catalonia's first anniversary of independence.
A group of masked secessionists were blown back by police, who sprayed eggs and paint on them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that constantly bothered tourists.
Later in the day, clashes resumed with police, who used police batons to try to stop the fight.
Within hours, independence groups chanting "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" clashed with conservative Democrats chanting "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people with minor injuries were treated during the protest.
Tensions in the region had risen a year ago when the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters will vote for independence, although there was a small presence among those who voted against the coup and many boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to disrupt the polling stations.
On Friday night pro-independence groups came out to stop a demonstration, under the auspices of the National Police.
Progress was being made, but the demonstration had to take a different direction.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer saw any prospects for Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're screwed", she said.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia were struggling to maintain momentum this year, along with their top leaders who were imprisoned or detained as a result of the independence referendum and subsequent declaration.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is heating up", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Juncker, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been on trial since last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of popular values and the pressure that the Spanish government has seen from the Commune", he said.
London: Men arrested after car crash at home
A man aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7:30 pm local time in Belynagard Crescent.
Superintendent Bob Blemings said damage was done to the house's doors and the building itself.
It's possible that the car hit a crossbar and partially damaged it.
In a match against Rangers, Menga's shot 1-0 won the game for Livington
Dolly Mangan's first goal ensured Livington's victory
Livington's promotion confused Rangers, transferring Steven Gerrard, the manager of Ibrox, causing their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mangan's shot seems to have been different for Gary Holt, reaching Hibernian in the second round.
In this Premier League season, Gerrard's side have been denied a win, and on Sunday they face the leaders Hart, who are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, Rapid Vienna hosted Rangers in the Europa League.
Livingston, who with head coach Holt continued his unbeaten run of six games while suffering a losing record until he was replaced by Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chances in front of the confused visitors.
Before scoring, Holt's team had to be ahead, immediately causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson took the lead, sparing no effort to score, then Alan Lithgow was able to direct all his efforts to a wide kick, meeting Craig Holcort's head kick.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the visitors in the designated areas.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston worked to open the scoring, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson trying to block Meng, who took the ball and hit it from the centre.
At this point, the Rangers were in a dominant position and their goalie defense was unbeatable, while goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unbeatable.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos broke Kelly's safety.
Scott Pittman was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Ligon by another Livingston player.
After two penalties, one of which was Holkitt's replacement for Glam Middleton, the other a hand-off for the game, the cross-attacks in Livingston's goal continued with a continuous push back.
"It was phenomenal", said Livingston.
Alasdair Lamont for the BBC Scotland programme from the Tony MacArthur Arena
It was a great game and a great result for Livingston.
One person said they were great, continuing to exceed their expectations.
Since moving up the ladder, their playing style and lineup have changed considerably, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for the team's revival since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett did a great job of building a strong defense, and in the process, Manga kept a close eye on Conor Goldson and Joe Warhol.
However, the Rangers' inspiration was short-lived.
As good as they played Gerard, they still didn't live up to the standards.
Their lack of a last ball and their side's one-off miss was a wake-up call for Rangers to emerge in the middle of the pitch.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
Smiles and blue clouds were on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at normalizing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed a range of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Keul to attend the opening of a huge mosque.
This city is home to a large Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police had taken security measures to block the entrance to the mosque from a crowd of 25,000, but many supporters were able to get a close look at their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to admit him into the country.
The fierce protests reflected the disapproval of some German Turks for treating the visitor as a hero and vilifying him as a self-proclaimed tyrant.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash on Deptford Road.
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 local time on a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets.
The driver of the car stopped, and according to witnesses, the man died at the scene.
The accident happened on Childress Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday crash, a month after another cyclist was killed.
Metropolitan police say they are working to identify the man and notify his family.
The road is closed and bus traffic has been redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Larin Prison Six officers injured in riot
Six officers were injured in the riots that followed the trial of a man in a maximum security prison for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at the Long Larton Prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 local time on Sunday and continue to this day.
A specialised team of tornado killers was brought in to quell the riots, involving eight prisoners from the same ward.
The killers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Long Lart has been brought in by specially trained prison staff to deal with the ongoing incident.
Six crew members were treated.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be arrested and spend a long time behind bars.
Long Lartein has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called to the prison to address a major riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (plains may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical cyclone to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Rosa hits the southwest desert, potentially causing flooding.
The National Weather Service has already considered the possibility of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the Phoenix cities of Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday in the rainy evening.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical winds.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was moving at 40 miles per hour toward the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict two to four inches of heavy rain, up to six inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Rocky and Great Basin, are likely to get one to two inches of water, possibly four inches each.
For flood-prone areas, Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is in danger of drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, these rains are likely to be beneficial for the Southwest, which is currently under threat of drought.
According to a report on the weather.com website, "More than 40 percent of Arizona is at risk of a major Category 8 drought, according to storm monitoring".
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads from the Baja Peninsula of Mexico to the coast.
Rosa, still strong Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is moving 385 miles south from Ponta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The wind is blowing over the cold waters of the Pacific, and so its power is increasing.
So, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening, due to the intensification of tropical winds.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rains could cause severe flooding.
As reported by weather.com, 3-6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches.
Then Rosa will blow north through Mexico as a tropical storm until it reaches the Arizona border Tuesday morning, and then late Tuesday night it will blow through Arizona and reach southern Utah.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is torrential rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern desert", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountains.
Four people arrested in connection with the attack on the Mithsomer Norton.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
At approximately 0400 hours local time on Saturday, the boy was found in a badly injured condition on the Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer North area.
He was taken to a hospital, where his condition was assessed as stable.
Avon and Somerset Police say two teenagers aged 17 and 18 and a man in his 20s were arrested in the Redstock area on the same night.
Police have called on anyone who may have a recording of the incident to contact them immediately.
Trump says Kavanaugh has become a victim of the Democratic Party's power, its anger.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party's reckless and dishonorable tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been a victim of the Democratic Party's power and anger throughout his run.
On Thursday, Kavanagh testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying the baseless allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her years ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial after hearing his accusation.
On Saturday, the president said, "The American people witnessed that day the intelligence, the character and the courage of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to elect Judge Cavanagh is the vote to elect one of the most brilliant legal thinkers of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant knowledge of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
During the midterm elections, the president alluded to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of the Republican convention.
- Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running.
That's why I'm fighting so hard for good candidates", he said.
Trump insisted that the Democrats have a mandate to "resist and oppose".
A spokesman for the leadership of the big old Republican Party told CNN that Kavanaugh's first general election nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have been affected by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, along with their poor eyesight
Authorities say at least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, many of them washed up on beaches by huge waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on a beach in Palo on Friday for a festival when a six-meter (18-foot) wave hit the beach, carrying bodies of people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
During a press conference in Jakarta, a representative of BNPB, the Indonesian disaster relief company, said that yesterday, when the tsunami warning was raised, people continued to do their thing on the beach and instead did not flee, resulting in their deaths.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it took cars, prisoners, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that before it hit the shore, the tsunami was moving at 800 kph (497 mph) over the open sea.
Some people climbed trees to protect themselves from the tsunami and survived", he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palo.
The aerial photographs released by the Aerial Photography Organization show many destroyed houses and shops, destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Tremors continued to hit coastal areas on Saturday.
Tremors were also felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Organization for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
It is said that the city's geographic location, lying on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have made the tsunami even bigger.
The damage to Nugroho was estimated to be "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies were found under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater in the flood plain, 300 kilometers north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications were in Dongola, "with no communication", said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that staff and volunteers were being directed to the affected areas.
They say this is already a tragedy, but it could have been worse.
On Sunday, the organization was heavily criticized for not keeping up with the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had reached the surface before the warning was due.
In an amateur recording that has surfaced online, a man in the upper deck is heard shouting a tsunami warning to people down the street.
Within minutes, the water collides with the shore, taking buildings and vehicles with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge power surge, making communication impossible in the area around Palu, which in turn made it difficult for authorities and rescue forces to send coordinates.
Authorities say the army has also started sending aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened to auxiliary forces only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
- The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
This is bad.
"Before the World Vision staff from Dongala reached Palou safely, where workers were sheltering in algae shelters in the backyard of their offices, they witnessed devastating scenes on their way", Mr Dosheba said.
They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
This is bad.
Even as aid groups began the brutal process of installing disaster recovery equipment, some complained that foreign aid workers, who were better informed, were prevented from traveling to Palou.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, aid and staffing can only begin if a disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered a provincial-level disaster", said Olia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "This is a national disaster", we can get international help, but we don't have the right to it yet.
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palo, families and friends of the missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the wonders that had been so painfully lost to the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Jendral Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, trained two of the missing parachutists ahead of the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The others at the Roa Roa Hotel, except for Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a paraplanner, I have my own emotional burden", she said.
Mr. Jenden recounts how he, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread in the paraglider community, desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach party.
But his messages received only one gray checkmark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it's a sign that the messages didn't get through", he said.
In Newport Levi, thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM while charging.
According to a news release from Newport Police, thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee filling an ATM in Newport Levi.
"The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at an amusement park and was about to deliver more cash to Detroit", wrote Dennis McCarty in the release.
While he was doing this, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a bag full of money that was to be delivered.
According to the witness, he saw several suspects fleeing, but the police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about their identities can contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been using the Ye alias for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes on Saturday night during a live broadcast of her new album, Yandy.
"She's replacing Ariana Grande, who canceled her speech for emotional reasons", said the show's organizer.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current name, West has noted that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think that ε is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means του", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Bo.
- So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It spread from the kanji, which means just Yi, and became a reflection of our good, bad, confused, everything.
The album is more about who we really are.
He is on the list of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was largely known as Puff Daddy, P. Didd or Didd, but this year he announced his preference for the names "Sister" and "Brotherly Love".
Jay-Z, who had previously worked with West, also wrote his name in capital letters or without.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody vendetta against students.
On Saturday, at the Tlatelolco compound, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force to oppress Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration on campus, troops opened fire, killing nearly 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were sweeping Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by giving a monthly stipend to those who study and by establishing more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education create opportunities for young people to become gang members.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
"While China is becoming more active in AI, the United States needs to double the amount it spends on AI research", says Kai-Fu Lin, an investor and AI business expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made statements about AI, while the US itself has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China unveiled its plan, and their goal is to be the leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good start, given that the US is way ahead of other countries, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI", said Li.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the next big thing the United States will achieve in artificial intelligence.
Li, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, whose book The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Field and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, invested in one of China's most powerful AI organizations, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence program at Carnegie Mellon University that beat out the highest-rated American actor, Othello. He later became the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee took on former U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next creators.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
"Academic leaders are not taken by China, but by corporations", said Lin.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired some of the most prominent academics in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changing immigration etiquette could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think we should immediately offer a green card to the PhDs in AI", he said.
The National Council of China presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"China's National Science Foundation funds academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", said Li.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Selection Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the legislation in the United States that seeks to create the National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward in months.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help resolve a years-long dispute with Greece that had been a barrier to its EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name means annexation of its territory and has banned it from NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov has announced that he will not participate in the vote, and there have been doubts among boycott campaigners whether the turnout will match the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Do you agree with NATO and EU membership and the adoption of the post-Greek agreement?"
Proponents of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price of becoming a full member of NATO or the European Union for Macedonia, which is one of the countries that has managed to survive the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the future of the youth of Macedonia, for a prosperous future under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgiouhskaya, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will oppose the vote to make it decisive.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority of the total vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there was no report of irregularities until 1:00 a.m.
However, turnout was 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the 2016 election, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gyose Tanevsky in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko filled out their ballots in a referendum to change Macedonia's name, thus paving the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarov, in front of the parliament, was setting up a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by people opposed to the referendum.
"We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join them proudly, not through the service door.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration", Kavarkarov said.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring great investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of NATO and the European Union", Zaev said after filling out his ballot.
He said that the answer would be to guarantee their prosperous future.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters voted in favor, which is less than the required number of votes.
According to another poll by Telma TV, 57 percent of Macedonians are still preparing to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the civility of a pro-Western government since May last year.
Look, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat all of Brighton's defence to hit the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were released from Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday in England at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made it look easy to score his goal in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in the middle of the field at the very beginning of the game.
He slid through Brighton's three defenders before going into the free-throw line.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greencoats.
He passed one, then passed a few more at the Brighton gate.
Then he made a pass to Sterling, who was to his left.
The English striker, reaching the goal, threw the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, pointing it at Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, and the ball slid into the right corner of the goal.
"Aguero has some problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that moment".
However, the Sky Blues were given an early lead in the Premier League by Sterling.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got the ball in that game in Brighton's half.
He made a beautiful pass to the left of Leroy Seine.
Seane made a few touches, then passed the ball to Sterling, who was on the other end of the field.
The Sky Blues put the ball in the goal before crossing the line.
City will play Hoffenheim in a Champions League friendly on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neugar Arena in the German city of Sinheim.
The Sharks want to take a surprise win against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, it was pointless to force them to start again.
But the competitive Shearer is hoping to go up against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if he can get a game against the Rockies, who are going to have a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least secured a spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they still hope to retain their division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, we can throw the ball, confident that the atmosphere and the crowd in Denver, as well as the opposing team, will be at the highest level that I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?"
The Nationals are yet to announce the start on Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to apply in the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was scheduled to make his 34th pitch, threw the ball Thursday and will return to his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2⁄3 innings this season.
Trump is at a rally in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the election of his top councillor, Brett Kavanagh, during a speech on the importance of the midterm elections in the Republican referendum.
Everything we've done will be on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, biggest elections. I'm not running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm fighting so hard for good candidates", she said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they're willing to take back power at any cost, you see the deceit and the disgust.
They don't care who they insult, who they have to go through to get power and government, that's what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
"Democrats", he says, "have a mission to 'resist and resist.'"
And you've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, rude, immoral, and deceitful people".
He was referring to the naming of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat Sen. Diane Feinstein, who was being booed by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you leak the document?
Oh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for someone... that was really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a big church.
It's very intolerant of people who express their opinions.
When the Movement activists at my local party voted me to run, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last person in the line of Labour MPs to be told they are not happy to see us here... and all because of our voices.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she has been a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
As for me, I've been criticized by the dancers for contradicting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironically, fate on issues like that that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders on.
The notice for Friday's East Nottingham Labour Party meeting said: "We want the meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour Party MP, Friday GC meetings were just like that.
Sadly, many congregations today do not celebrate this, and the kind and honest politics have long since been forgotten, if at all.
It has become even more apparent that there is no tolerance of differences of opinion in the Labour Party and everyone's opinion is considered in terms of whether or not it is acceptable to the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when my colleagues, with whom I thought I shared similar political views, began to expect me to change my views and have views that I would never otherwise agree with... whether it was national security or the EU single market.
As soon as I make a public speech (and it doesn't matter what I say), it's followed by a flurry of insults on social media, calling for and postponing elections, condemning central politics and telling me that I have no right to be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are political in nature.
I'm amazed at the skill and determination of my colleagues who endure sexual or racist abuse every day, but never get away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how the levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that enlarged church, and every vote of no confidence or change in election rules makes the party even more fragile.
I've been told many times over the last two years to keep my head down, not talk so much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, angered by being ignored by the Thatcher government, which had literally brought down my comprehensive school classroom, I have been driven to provide even better public services to those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, and the recent election was no exception.
No one in East Nottingham is confused by my political views and my disagreements with current leaders.
All I'm going to say to those who are moving on Friday is this: when the country is moving towards Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, my only statement is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether Labour or not, and I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of re-election or political expectation will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for East Nottingham.
Air 38-17 Melrose, the Invincible Air is now in the air.
The last two attempts could have changed the outcome in some way, but Ayr certainly deserved to win on this great and fun day in the Tennessean Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side in the top 10.
In the end, it was their excellent defense and their success that won the game for the home side, and coach Peter Myrch had every right to be happy.
"We were tested in these games, but we have not won yet, so I should be happy", he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said, "Upper Air, they made better use of their opportunities than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute pass from Frazier Hughes gave Ayr a boost, but during the Scottish Cup, Rory Hughes' yellow card against the Warriors gave Melrose the opportunity to add to the score, and Jason Beggott made an irreversible punch.
Climo had previously extended Ayr's lead on penalties: after half time, he scored a point, then attempted a solo stroke to make the score 17-5 at half-time for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well and a pass from Patrick Anderson, delivered by Beggott, reduced the gap to five points.
After a long break, caused by a serious injury to Ruairid Nott, he was sent off and after the resumption, Ayr went further through a shot by Stafford McDowell with a climbing delivery.
Air Force acting captain Blair McPherson was given a yellow card at the time, and again Melrose delivered an extra hit thanks to Bruce Colvin's fierce pressure at the end.
The hosts, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for throwing Clymo out of the line without a ball, McPherson landed on a ball in front of Air.
Clembo struck again as he started almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe stopped a shot from David Armstrong and sent flanker Gregor Henry away to stop the home side's second-stroke.
The star of Still Game is ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Chiara is set to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he became the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six plays Jack Gervais in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hampill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the show's final series, and it was revealed that Kiernan was planning her life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Eddyftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving Glasgow restaurant business.
"The sea is ours", Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean.
The Marines are guarding the naval base at La Paz.
Public buildings have been designated an ocean blue flag.
It's the slogan of the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "The sea is ours by law".
It is our duty to restore it".
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the watershed lost to Chile in the 19th century resource conflict with Chile is still vivid, as is the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades as Bolivia awaits a landmark decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has a determination, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it wants a good ending", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Most Bolivians will watch the ICC ruling, which will be shown on all the big screens in the country, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will back Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia and give it free access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is now fighting a decisive battle to be re-elected next year, was also instrumental in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe the court's decision will not be in favor of Bolivia, and it would make little difference if it were.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no control over Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
"The decision of the ICC comes six months after the final hearing of the case shows that the case was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And apart from the further progress of the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed that.
"The issue of Bolivia's permission to sail has been ignored by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric was the reason that the last vestiges of goodwill left by Chile were wiped out.
Eventually, Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate one day, but after that, the discussions will get very complicated.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
In The Hague, Bolivian representative and former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velcense rejected the idea that the court had ruled unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement in the interests of both countries, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most famous presidents, used the maritime issue as a political platform.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to free access to the Pacific", he added.
"Decision is the opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization until the U.S. instills confidence.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never give up nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Sunday.
He urged the United States to follow through on the promises he made at the Singapore Leaders' Summit.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months after the Singapore summit.
Ri said it was a dream of a teenager who continued to impose sanctions, and U.S. objections to the Korean War's declaration of an end would never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington has warned that it will not agree to the declaration without a major step of disarmament in Pyongyang.
And Kim, and US President Donald Trump, they want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons, which the country sees as probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
A new collection of hats has been launched at the Paris Fashion Show, and will soon be available on the High Street in your area.
If you want to expand your collection of hats and completely protect yourself from the sun, this is what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browney unveiled their new SS19 big-shoe collection during Paris Fashion Week, and the collection stunned everyone.
A lot of inefficient hats have been trending on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the podium.
The most striking feature of Valentino's collection was the huge purple hat with a wide edge of decorated feathers wrapped around the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include ornate snowflakes, wizard's hat, and even a monarch apple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Broney also showed off a selection of special masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the many colorful masks had lipstick that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than a high-end cutout.
One piece resembled a scuba diver with its tube and goggles, while the other was like a molten butterfly cone.
And if you keep making the high fashion statement, you'll be successful.
Fashion observers predict that giant street lights could soon appear on your main streets.
The larger-than-usual hats followed La Bombay, the two-foot-thick, fringe-rimmed hat that was seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hugely uncomfortable hat cult tag, which was spread all over social media, sent another great piece to the podium: a muddy beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a white leather handle with raffia edges and covered with white leather, was the most popular item from Jacques La Rivera's SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Star designer Luke Hermitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags on the headlines next summer, because the designers have made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are incredibly important for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain records of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another stunning run of test scores, only enhanced by individual and group successes in sport, the arts, music and other community work.
In Scotland, with over 30,000 pupils, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a pre-arranged curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a widespread and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it will go into their head.
If you speak to a person in his language, it will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the current results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
68 percent of foreign language students got A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of students received high A's in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are embracing languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly be required of children and young people in the future.
Now, in independent schools, language as an elective is treated the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math).
In 2014, the UK Commission on Employment and Skills identified the reasons employers have difficulty filling job vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing opportunities for promising jobs that require language skills, these skills have become important in a global world.
Whatever career they choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, by mastering a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate face-to-face with foreigners will mechanically put a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, 75 percent of the 4,000 British adults surveyed were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for kids today.
Knowing several languages, especially in developing economies, can help children find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will have its own language of instruction.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while the rest will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK from 2020 onwards, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what you choose for your child, schools will always have a variety of languages to choose from, and the staff at those schools are experts in the field.
The aim of Scottish Independent Schools is to provide an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
Now, in this global business environment, we cannot deny that languages remain essential to the future of a country, and so this needs to be reflected in education.
And yet, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young Scots this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Welton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be decided.
"It's going to be more than a minute, but less than 48", said Welton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
Following a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need a preseason game to get ready", he said.
Trump's time at the West Virginia rally on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five rallies Trump has planned for next week, including stops at friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote to confirm his nomination to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat has been delayed as Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing control of Congress, with the vote counting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online, live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become a hot topic over sexual misconduct allegations, bringing with it a delay of a Senate confirmation vote for a week until the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans who are facing the November election gain momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are aimed at rallying volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", said a Trump campaign spokesman who was reluctant to give his name, according to Reuters.
Today's rally at the Weisbank Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Last month, on Saturday, it was the second time Trump visited West Virginia, where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president is here to try to promote himself in the election", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup U.S. team was confidently fighting to keep hope alive until Sunday's game.
After three one-on-one sessions on a Sunday afternoon, the four could just be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The power-up swing is a completely invented sporting concept that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
So, where do they think the driving force is now?
"They had a six-point lead, which is now four, and I think we're keeping that as a small driving force", Jordan Speight said as he walked that day.
Europe has a clear four-point lead and 12 more to play.
Americans, as Speight says, feel there's little wind in their sails, even though they have a lot to be inspired by, no less than the way Speight and Justin Thomas played each other all day and each of them added three points to four.
Spit was lethal in the tee to green and leads by example.
The throat roars of celebration intensified as his round continued, and he made the decisive shot to earn a four-field field goal as he and Thomas lost two to two.
His shot that gave them a 15-point lead was coupled with a similar bang, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of this.
"You have to work harder and just worry about your game", Spit said.
This is what each of these players left behind now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champion.
The odd but attractive couple from Europe is 4 out of 4 and can't be wrong.
Hollywood was the only couple who didn't have a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning golf.
That run and the way their energy seemed to flow into that angry crowd and back, confirms that they are the players who should win on Friday, and there would be no more famous players than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European victory before sunset at Le Golf National.
It's best to have both at the same time in different holes.
But the talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short paper about Sergio Garcia, a morning golf hero when he was Alex Noren's partner.
One bogie and two doubles on the first nine pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into the hole, never to be pulled out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the squares are so fascinating to watch, because of the relationships between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the tactics can change in an instant.
Europe as a team has been playing better and made a significant improvement until the final day, but the quarter-final session showed that Team USA showed a level of enthusiasm that no one, especially Stateside, expected.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe had a 10-6 lead.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe will have a big advantage with a 10-6 lead over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-quarter game.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari pair turned the score around with two victories over the resistant Tiger Wood to take their talisman to La Golf Nacional by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who were trying to win back their trophy they lost two years ago at Hazelton, took a 3-1 lead over the American side in the morning game.
The United States put up more resistance during the game, but they failed to win.
Jim Furke's side needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to get the trophy back.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were named the Hollywood of the Week after a stunning weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in a four-ball game, they worked hard to defeat Woods and American player Bryce DeCambeau, by a larger score of 5-4.
Woods, who had been pushing through two games on Saturday, put on a great performance, but he had already lost 19 of his 29 games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, resting from the morning game, returned to his teammate Henry Stenson in the quarter-final and lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopcan, who are world number one and third respectively.
Europe, however, did not have it the way it wanted it on that pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas were two points ahead of the Americans on Saturday.
They beat Spain's John Rami and Jan Polter 2-1 on four balls during the game and later returned to beat Pochter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 by missing the opening two holes in the quarterfinals.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history that a team came back from a four-point deficit and went to a singles match, even though the Fury side only needed one to keep the trophy.
After two days of second best, after Sunday's counter-hit, however, it seems that the Huda is ahead of them.
North Korea says that under no circumstances will it disarm completely without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions were fueling mistrust of the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's nations that North Korea had taken "significant charitable measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and anti-missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and taking responsibility for non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot guarantee our nation's security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm.
While Ri echoed North Korea's familiar grievances about Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps gradually, his statement was important because it did not deny that unilateral denuclearization had come under control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump at their first joint summit in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has always wanted to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls for easing tough international sanctions on South Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization is a priority and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective, and even objects to the declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a direct dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are only deepening our mistrust.
Ri said nothing about plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If South Korea, not the United States, had been on this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock.
Even if that were the case, Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that the US targeting of the North Korean mainland with missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "suicide missile man".
At the UN this year, Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim for his bold move to denuclearize, but said there was still more work to be done, and sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame, saying it didn't matter if it took two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia have demanded that the UN Security Council compensate Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and without fail until the complete, final, affirmative renunciation of nuclear weapons".
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea to disrupt Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rai at the United Nations General Assembly and said he would travel again next month to prepare for the second summit in Pyongyang.
Pompeo has been to Pyongyang three times this year, but the last visit didn't go so well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made and that North Korea could within hours accuse him of making a series of alarmist demands.
At a meeting this month, North Korea promised to dismantle its missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He told Kim that the "appropriate measures" in Singapore were Trump's promised guarantees of security and were aimed at improving relations with Washington.
Harvard University students are taking a special training course on getting enough rest.
The new course gave her graduate students the opportunity to sleep more to combat the growing macho culture of caffeinated all-nighter studying.
The academic found that students at the world's top universities often lack the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
This course was designed by Charles Kessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who claims it is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was excited to start her course on the impact of insomnia on education.
Finally, a girl came up to him and said, "Why am I only learning about this now, in high school?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised her", she told the Telegraph.
This year's first course explains to students how getting a good night's sleep can affect academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to start classes as soon as it became clear that students had not actually slept that week.
The one-hour course includes a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a hall where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how poor sleep can affect athletic performance, and the importance of sleep.
Another section shows participants how prolonged insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
We know that this isn't going to change student behavior overnight.
"But we believe they have a right to know about it, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of tobacco use", added Professor Kessler.
He said the proud culture of "all-nighter" still exists, adding that modern technology and its ever-increasing pressure on students means insomnia is a growing problem.
Quality and adequate sleep should be the secret weapon of students to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, even prevent weight gain, because insomnia turns on the brain's starvation mode and they're always hungry.
Raymond, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, is helping Professor Keisler organize the course, having taught one last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired courses across the university.
Next, he expects applicants to ask to participate in this educational program before entering the competition.
Professor Keisler recommends that students memorize their sleep schedules and wake up to learn about the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers Menga defeated Gerrards
The Rangers were once again knocked out as Dolly Mangan's strike led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's team at Livingston.
After a 4-1 defeat at Johnstone on 4 February, Ibbrooks were keen to record their first win, but Gerrard's side were disappointed by Gary Holtz's second defeat in the eighteenth game, leaving them eight points behind in the Premier League.
Menga came out seven minutes before halftime and it looked like the Rangers would never be ready to play.
While Rangers are sixth in the table, Livingston go into third place with a few goals to spare behind Hibernian.
Later, the Rangers had another problem, as linebacker Calum Spence suffered a head injury from an object thrown.
Gerrard's eight-point margin was also due to Erin's substitution for Bethfred in the semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, joined Livingston on points last week, and he was amazed at how his opponents were upset by his good form.
The Rangers may have been dominant, but Livingston was more of a price tag.
They used the two minutes when Megan was first dismissed, giving Scott Pittman an opportunity to attack Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder stopped the ball.
Cagan Jacobs' shot went to Craig Halkett, but midfielder Alan Lithgow was only able to bounce the ball back.
The Rangers took the game into their own hands, but in the last third of the game, their game was more hopeful than believable.
Alfredo Morelos was scheduled to take a penalty kick after a collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombians' calls.
The Rangers had two shots in the first half, but former Inbrook goalkeeper Liam Kelly was restless from the shots of Lasana Colby and Ovi Ijaria.
Livingston's 34th-minute opening was against the rules of the game, but no one could deny it was a worthy shot.
The Rangers were again unable to resist Jacobs's attack.
Scott Arfield didn't react to Declan Callaghan passing the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed it to Megan to finish.
Gerard replaced Calibali with Ren Kent at half-time, after which the striker attacked Morelles, but Kiley stopped the ball immediately.
Livingston continued to cheer the crowd with his play as Lithgow and Halkitt kept the ball with them.
Holt's teammates were able to play in their favour at some points, but McGregor was able to push Jacobs back before Lithgow was hit from the corner.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton was again due for a ticket for a collision with Jacobs, but Thompson ignored him again.
The inventor of the almanac Geiger's Calculator
And now a little bit of our Sunday morning almanac. On this day, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Giger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the Geiger counter.
Once a cornerstone of science, the Geiger counter has also become a pop culture landmark, as in The Bell of Coronado, starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What is it?
Roger: This is a Giger counter that helps detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you hear the presence of atoms in the radioactive minerals.
Evans: Tell me, this really works now.
Hans Giger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on today.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see foreign cells.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells.
The idea is to take immune cells from a patient and replicate them in a lab bag.
They'll find proteins that are specific to many types of cancer and then they'll inject the patient back.
The vaccine is showing promise in cancer patients.
One woman who received a vaccine that recognizes rogue cells found that her ovarian cancer had disappeared after more than 18 months.
The idea is to take immune cells from a patient and engineer them in a lab to detect a protein called HER2 that is native to many types of cancer and then inject those cells back into the patients.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the vaccine is promising.
The HER2 gene is linked to several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer, explains Professor Berzowski.
Taking immune cells from a patient and training them to detect cancer cells has also helped to treat a form of leukemia.
Kanye West's "Make America Great Again" headline on Saturday Night Live (SNL) has started the debate against Trump.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was humiliated on SNL when he began praising the United States, and President Donald Trump announced that he would be sworn in in 2020.
With the "Make America Great Again" hat, she sang the third song of the night, "City of the Wild Ones".
When I talk to white people, they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist.
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began its show with a Matt DeNone impersonation, where the Hollywood star played a scene from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about Christina Blaise Ford's sexual assault before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although it was not shown, West's video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock did it to get West or not.
West also complained to the audience that the hat she was wearing made it difficult for her to stand.
They slandered me.
They told me not to go out in that hat.
They did it to my head.
According to the Washington Examiner, I'm in heaven.
He went on, "Do you want to see heaven?" He said that as if he wanted to wear his Superman hat, as if that meant no one could tell him what to do.
Try to love.
His comments caused outrage in the audience twice. SNL members were also upset at the show. Variety reports that one person even said, "The whole studio was rocked".
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by singing "I Love" as Perrier Bottle.
West was endorsed by Conservative Party leader Candace Thorn, who wrote: "To one of the bravest souls. Thank you for your support in front of the crowd".
Host Karen Hunter wrote that the West was just what it was, and that's definitely great.
"But I don't want to praise someone by buying their songs or their clothes or supporting their art when their ideology is dangerous to my community".
He's free.
"We are too", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He follows Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P-Dee.
And indeed, the legendary Prince of Music changed his name as a symbol and that's how he stayed Prince.
There was an attempted stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of stabbing a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihakamori.
On Monday, the defendant will appear in Belfast County Court.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Harrington, the star of Game of Thrones, is the personification of a poisonous man.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as the sharp-tongued Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has broken the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles make boys think that they need to be treated with respect to enjoy them.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, 31, confirmed that he is very determined to address the issue.
"I'm very much thinking about where we went wrong with masculinity", he said.
"The way we trained men, the way they grew up, and now we see this problem".
Keith believes that television should be partly responsible for teaching toxic masculinity with its many masculine characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is acquired?"
What do they learn from TV and the streets that makes young boys become that kind of man?
I think this is one of the top issues of our time. How do we change this?
Because it's definitely bad for young boys.
In an interview, he admitted that when all of the Game of Thrones movies were completed next summer, he would not play in any more seasons because he was tired of the battlefields and the horses.
In November, Keith is set to play Sam Shepard's The West Wing in a film about a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor recently confirmed that the first good thing about Game of Thrones is meeting his wife, Leslie.
"I met my wife in this film, and that was the beginning of my future family, and then my life", he said.
In the Emmy-nominated fantasy television series, Rosie played Igrid, the love interest of Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's father's home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS China reports a 14 percent increase in cases.
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 cases were reported.
Unlike in the past, most cases were sexually transmitted.
In some parts of China, HIV was normally spread rapidly through infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health authorities reported that HIV transmission had been reduced to zero.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing by 100,000 a year.
Sexually transmitted AIDS has become a major issue for China's LGBT community.
1997 China outlawed homosexuality, but discrimination against the LGBT community is considered unjust.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is said that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had relationships with men will marry women.
Unprotected sex is the leading cause of disease transmission.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV treatment more accessible to address the problem.
Maxime Voltaire denies that the data of the senators of the Grand Old Party was leaked, claiming that it is a dangerous lie and a conspiracy.
Maxim Voltaire of the United States on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of his staff posted the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrats have confirmed that the complaints were from far-right pundits and hackers.
"Lies, lies and insulting lies", he said in a tweet.
The leaked information included home addresses and cell phone numbers belonging to United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mickey Leane and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online by an anonymous person on Thursday on Capitol Hill during the Supreme Court hearing on Brett Kavanaugh's sexual abuse case.
The leak came after three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the messages matched the address of Waters' office, and that this was the address from which Waters' personnel information was leaked.
Waters went on to say that these baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were exposed as a result of these false and misleading allegations is not responsible in any way for the leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is anger-denial", wrote the Flash.
This means he has no desire to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't object.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
He needs to stay calm and peaceful.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics blamed for angry behavior during Tuesday's hearings.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro was trying to oust Waters in the midterm elections and shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Well, if it's true", he wrote with a smile.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant law enforcement and regulatory authorities to these allegations.
"We will be keen to see the culprits identified", he continued, "They will be held fully accountable for their actions, which have a devastating and devastating impact on any member of my staff.
The film is about Johnny English Strikes Again.
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit meaning in a new British language film. This seems to be acceptable in the case of the Johnny English action-comedy revival, which began as early as 2003 and was revived again in 2011 with the Johnny English revival.
It would be ridiculous to think what a waste we are to have a domestic export capability.
Anyway, the unmistakable, small-eyed, uncomfortable Johnny English has been licensed a second time, which means he's a comedic face for non-English-speaking communities.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his oddities, looked a bit like Clouseau, Mr. Bean, with his contribution to the fire chariot song played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the character of Atticus, a mysterious traveller and international man who played a forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, creating chaos behind him.
There's a beautiful moment or two in the last Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter in a medieval military uniform and a helmet with the helicopter's tail spinning around it.
Atticus's physical comedic gift is shown, but the humor has lost its power and is considered redundant, as it is already a staple of serious films like 007 and Mission: Impossible.
Humor is more appealing to children than it is to adults, and to me, Johnny English is not as artistic and fixed as Atkinson's Beanie.
The UK is in real danger right now.
Cyber hackers have hacked into the online data of British spies, revealing the identities of secret agents, replacing the agent who is a bit of a role model for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a confused and persecuted prime minister who suffers from a sense of political uncertainty.
The advisors say that since all the spies are exposed, one should bring back one of the retired.
This means bringing back Johnny English, who now teaches at a number of institutions, but also teaches how to be a secret agent.
The Englishman returned to Whitehall for a quick chat and reunited with his former partner Buffy, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and a submarine captain, playing the happy hockey players, where Vicky Pepperdine is a little loose.
So Batman and Robin make a big mistake and return to the Secret Service, meeting the beautiful wife of Olga Kurlenko's character, Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has fallen for billiard technicians who believe they can solve Britain's computer problems, Jack Lacy, who played the villain Jason Volta.
English and Buff start their series of pranks. As waiters, they burn down a French restaurant, riot on the Volta ship. English sets up anarchy using virtual reality headphones to see what's going on at Voltaire's house.
In the end, all the action was revealed, but because it was fun and interesting, there was a whole children's TV show about it.
It's pretty moderate.
And I always wonder, considering the other English films, if it's possible for British filmmaking to give Roman Atkinson a role that's really fair to his talent.
Labour insists they are working on a plan to make British workers work four days a week but get paid instead of five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is proposing a plan to make British people work four days a week, but get paid instead of five.
The party wants companies to give their employees one extra day off thanks to the availability of artificial intelligence.
It would be nice if workers had three days off, but they get paid for the day they stay home.
Sources say the idea has been put on the economic agenda and the country is set to be transformed for the benefit of workers.
The idea of a four-day workweek was endorsed by the World Trade Center. It is a good way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party spokesman told the Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, the proposal will be approved.
This is not a problem to solve in a day, but the idea of a four-day workweek is in line with the Party's approach to balancing the economy as well as the Party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea is not yet fully considered by the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy of the party, and is not being considered by the party.
John McDonnell had organized a conference for Labour to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to re-evaluate the distribution of power in the utilities between the poor executives and the poor.
The shadow chancellor also plans that water company shareholders will not receive their healthy share, as the Labour Party may make cuts given a number of shortcomings.
He also confirmed that they plan to withhold 10 percent from companies and pass it on to employees who cheat up to 500 euros in utility bills.
Lindsey Gramm, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that the FBI is going to change its mind about Kavanaugh.
The FBI's investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week.
In a Sunday interview, a reporter for 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more unassuming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
I said I'd be at the hearing, I said I talked to Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed, and I said, "You did it?"
He was determined, without hesitation.
The gram is still as silent as a fish.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's an unfounded accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett is in complete denial", Graham added, addressing Christina Leslie Ford.
And not everyone he points to can confirm that.
This is a 36-year story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is Global Citizen Action and will it reduce poverty?
This week, New York City is hosting the Global Citizen Event, an annual music event featuring amazing star bands with a wonderful mission to reduce poverty.
This is the seventh year that tens of thousands of people have gathered in the park to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardy Bee and Shawn Mendes, but also to speak out about the event's ultimate goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, Global Citizen is a continuation of the Global Poverty Initiative. It is an international advocacy group that aims to increase the number of active activists fighting to end poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event, unless you want VIP tickets, you have to do a few things, like volunteer, email the governing bodies, make phone calls and a number of other activities aimed at eradicating poverty.
How much has Global Citizen accomplished?
Is it a good idea to hire people with free admission, or do they just feel good about the idea that just sending emails can make a difference?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, 19 million actions have been taken by its supporters for various causes.
These actions are said to have helped to rally world leaders and raise more than $37 billion, which could change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group received 390 calls and applications, raising nearly $10 billion.
The group says the fund's funds could directly reach some 659 million people worldwide.
The calls were mainly directed to Nutrition Power, a UK-based investment company whose ideology is to develop children to their full potential. After receiving 4,700 submissions from Global Citizen, it pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda.
"We can, with the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, including you, make history on social injustice against malnutrition", said Tracey Ullman, Food Force Ambassador, at her live concert in London in 2018.
The group also announced that following more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government has decided to fund the Food Power programme, which will help feed 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the Web is, "What makes you believe we can end poverty?"
Global Citizen says, "It's a long and difficult road, with ups and downs and failures.
Like the civil rights and anti-propaganda movements before us, we will succeed because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are among the stars who came to participate in the New York event, which is hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to disrupt Russian energy exports.
"Washington could use its navy to block Russian energy supplies, including to the 'Near East,' if it so chooses", said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
The military added that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is a legitimate invitation from the government, is a new prerequisite for finding new markets.
"I believe they will sell their energy to the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, with the help of our navy, has the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, it can block them to make sure that their energy doesn't get to the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the event, which was hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit organization that bills itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to working with Russia and Iran, noting that they are basically the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more or less a substitute for and maximum use of fuel", he said, portraying Russia as a one-trick pony with a fossil fuel economy.
According to the announcements, the Trump administration was fulfilling its mission to increase LNG exports to Europe by replacing Russia, offering a cheaper option to European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have been trying to convince Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a "spook" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, built to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 square meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply economically justified and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was met with a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Confederation of Industry (GAF), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply", said German Federation of Industry (GAF) president Daenerys Kemp after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be making a strong case for the 2020 presidential election, said a Massachusetts senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she would be looking hard to run for president after the midterm elections on Saturday.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in charge", she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will be very careful to run for president".
In a public meeting, Warren expressed his opinion of President Donald Trump, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was candid in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavin.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll conducted on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe he should not run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of the nomination.
The poll showed former governor Deval Patrick had more supporters, with 38 percent in favor of his likely candidacy versus 48 percent against.
Other key Democratic names touched on the list of possible 2020 nominees include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, reports The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at a rally for Donald Trump about Palin's PTSD
Trac Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after registering in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and fined for domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he comes back, I can address to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the scars that our soldiers come back with", she told a crowd at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest in a locked room and said of his friend and other war veterans that they come back a little changed, they come back tense, they come back wondering if they'll find respect for all that their fellow soldiers and pilots and other members of the military have given to this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and fined for domestic violence against a woman, according to a report on domestic violence and the use of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, Washington, supporting the challenge of a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to people fleeing criminal gangs or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories briefly appeared in Washington on Friday as court counsel to support policies against asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name is Grace W. Augustus. The hearings of the lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy were not disclosed.
She told her partner and the boys in her powerful gang that they had insulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace cited El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which host a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that have ongoing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was in conflict with a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who had experienced domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rass said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, state and international law".
"State law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the clear facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban does not uphold that principle", the court counsel said briefly.
The lawyers then briefly argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry was hurting the U.S. economy, saying they were potential entrepreneurs and suppliers of essential labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of gangs and domestic violence.
"The refuge is for those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
The shelter was never meant to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palu, as the number of deaths on the way to find fighters has doubled.
For the fighters, it was pretty scary.
"It was very hard", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, caring for her feverish little boy in a devastated evacuation center in Palo.
Every minute, the ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
They saw residents return to their destroyed homes, picking up their belongings from wet places, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who had torn his back and shoulders, were lying in Palus Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for continuous severe concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt when a powerful earthquake shook the five-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was crushed under the rubble, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of using propaganda to intimidate.
A week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in the US praising the daily advantages of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda through the US media.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the Chinese subscription of the Des Moines Register, Iowa's biggest-selling newspaper, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election showed what US officials told Reuters, that this is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a worsening trade war, and they've evened the score by imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
The counter-tariffs imposed by China in the earlier phase of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, American and Chinese experts say.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Brentstead, a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Brantsted wrote in his Sunday column in the Des Moines Register, by placing propaganda ads in our own free press, China is now doubling down on the persecution.
"By placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging America's tradition of dedication to free speech and the press", Brentsted wrote.
"However, given that the media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, a limited number of conflicting views can be found on the cover of a newspaper down the street in Beijing and it is impossible to see a true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic path", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers" had avoided his offer to publish the article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans in Kavanaugh's camp are pushing women out of the polls ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
While many senior Republicans are sticking to their position and supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned they will face opposition in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around this was extremely heated, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue the vote.
"These things can't be undone", said Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Riehr said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona's last-minute insistence on the need for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, they will not forget it in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, when the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate aisle.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be enormous", nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among the unbiased voters in the suburbs, and among young voters between 18 and 29 who don't like the president, but don't often vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony on allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts speculated that if Republicans decided to confirm his nomination, there might be a backlash.
"It's been a mess for the Republican Party", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele earlier this week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be on the court, but also how the Republicans approached it and how they treated him", Guy Cecil, who heads the Priorities USA group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, Americans seem to be a little bit divided on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either probably or confidently believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent probably or confidently believe Kavanaugh.
What's more, 38 percent believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, and 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's claim, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had drunkenly attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party at Yale University in 1980.
The creator of World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the world's first sardine, is launching a startup that will aim to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online data warehouse.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The thing about a personal online repository is that the user decides who can access the information.
The company calls it empowering people with data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company will provide the resources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform offered by IBM, a few amateur programmers who were hired to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team aren't talking to Facebook or Google about whether to make a complete change in places where their business models are completely changing in a second.
We don't ask them for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based grid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann, a clergyman who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured 100 years later in his home town.
Lieutenant General, Father Bernard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Benghazi and Lecour.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said, "It's very symbolic that the memorial will be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning deed".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-General Bernard Vann led his battalion through the thick fog of St Quentin and under the fire of field guns and machine guns.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and, with the utmost courtesy, pushed the line forward, then single-handedly quickly took out a field gun and slaughtered the three members of the squad.
The lieutenant general was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that I knew I would never deserve, but that I respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor to be part of the parade", adding that the dignity of a true hero is reflected in the support of so many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 but instead saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 in a crowded auditorium only to be blocked from seeing the main event.
There were 13 bouts scheduled in San Jose, including six majors, to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, just as Gerard Moussa and Rory McDonald were about to fight, TV viewers in the UK were surprised to see Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed, for they were left until morning for a special fight.
One fan described the switch from children's cartoons to "a cruel joke" on Twitter.
"It's a government policy that at 6pm, this kind of content is not appropriate, so they had to switch from children's shows", Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, told Bellator in response to a question about the switch.
"Yes, Peppa Pig", he said.
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think we can do it", Coker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning there, and we can't do it until 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, which is Monday on their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when the message was changed there, there were a lot of messages, none of which were pretty.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a state-level problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're gonna cut the number of six fights down to five, like we usually do, we tried to give the fans more, but we failed.
This is a surprising situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that everyone was like him until high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, first hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out about gay rights to give others hope.
She also said that after becoming a parent, she was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The two-year-old regular host Kirsty Young took a few months off due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up, he felt inferior to others because it was not acceptable in society to love boys and girls.
He said, "Today, that feeling of inferiority and being different actually gives me the strength to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove she was something so people wouldn't be disappointed to find out about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he was lucky enough to live an open life, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire hope in others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, in 2013 was a dream come true for her.
Last year, she married an Oscar-winning director 20 years her senior, but she says the age difference was never an issue.
He said that when you go through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- it was hard to find a teammate who had gone through the same wild things.
The couple had a son in June named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale says the whole outlook changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said the whole point is to win a gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from cancer.
Dale said that his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if they won a ticket to the London 2012 Games, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be there to sit in the front row,'" he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and it was only when she stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that she wasn't invulnerable", she said.
The following year, Dale competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, diving in front of an Olympic crowd at home, it couldn't have felt better", she said.
It also influenced her choice of first song, Heather Small's "Proud", which accompanied her throughout her Olympic training, and which she still fondles.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor shape, is on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to work on his fitness if he doesn't want it to be an unfortunate episode.
He's playing in his 12th tournament, but coach Jim Furyk has left him on the bench for Sunday's game.
Instead of being the center of attention, as has so often happened, the five-time winner spent half his day as a fan and the other half working on his game on the court, trying to fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old, who was not even one of the best first-strikers at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where indiscretions usually punish wrong-hitters.
And even if the champion himself isn't so scared, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with young Tommy Fitwood to win every game this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their 12 individual games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk was confident in his boys, not that he had anything more to say.
"He fully understood his role today, he put his hand on my shoulder, he hugged me and he said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has great confidence in his own strength.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's given so much to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was planning more, but it worked out, and I think that's the way we should have gone.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really matched his individual highs.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence adds something incredible to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic and clever, likes to play tricks on people's heads, and he's a great team player", she explained.
I think the young players had fun playing against him this week, too, and it was fun to watch.
He's giving away a lot more than he's playing.
Europe's senior Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon be gone
European captain Thomas Byrne knows from experience that a significant lead before the Ryder Cup finals can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where the Black Ballesteros team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with a slight difference of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, where we lost, and also in Valderrama, where we won, but with a small advantage", Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 overall at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will be at your best.
Come out and do it right.
Nothing's over as long as you have points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to try to win this award, and that's what we're focused on.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also recognize who's on the other side, the best players in the world.
Reflecting on how his players performed on a hard course, Bjorn added: "I could never have outdone myself in this.
Tomorrow is a whole story.
Tomorrow is the one-on-one, and that's a whole different thing.
It's nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, you're going through a whole new test as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give to the players, make the most of tomorrow.
Now, let's leave it to your teammate, who also has to do his best tomorrow.
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored 3 out of 4 points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these turning points of the last day, he was a member of the winning Brooklyn team, then he was on the losing side, so Europe was out of the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 senior, got his players together before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want us to go right from the start, like we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When that drive somehow starts to work, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We pick our lineup accordingly and we give the guys the promise that tomorrow we're going to try to do a miracle.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight, he will face Rory McIlroy in the main event, the other first-half Europeans are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Poulter.
"I picked the guys in this order because I think it's the right lineup from start to finish", Bjorn said of the players he picked.
The launch of Germany's new battleship has been delayed once again
The German Navy's new frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but will not be until at least the end of the year due to broken systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates Rheinland-Pfalz has been delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman said, according to Die Zeit.
The ship was to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but concerns over post-delivery issues prevented the ambitious project from being completed.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some secret technologies such as reduced radio detection, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service lives; it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from local ports for up to two years.
But the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to expand its influence abroad, will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigates made headlines last year when the German Navy declined to operate the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilding company after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German press points to a number of key programming and technical flaws that would have made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of 120 sailors, which is half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be significantly heavy, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to make further improvements.
They say the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the equipment, the total cost of the project, including the training of the staff, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have gone from an initial €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems with the new frigates are even more important in light of recent warnings about the weakening of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the German military was actually "consuming ships that could be deployed".
The official said the problem has grown over time as older ships have been retired but not replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to replenish the Navy's strength.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new study in a wooded area in the Scottish Highlands aims to understand how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the unique behaviour of these flying mammals and contribute to their future conservation.
The research, led by scientists at the National Trust in Scotland, will follow the common and crawling bats, as well as the brown long-tailed bat and Dobenton's bat at Inverewe Gardens in Worcester-Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the nest to monitor the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
An expert analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' vocal signals, and determine what species are doing.
Then we'll map the environment and report back to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS environmental consultant Rob Duar hopes the results will reveal which natural habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to understand the benefits of environmental management practices, such as the creation of forestry gardens, and help to understand how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the number of bats has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affect their natural habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a threat, as can fly-stick papers and chemical processing of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
The girls aren't really blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes time to hunt.
They use sophisticated voice-tracking techniques to locate insects and block their runways.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the living quarters, and occasionally perform rescue operations.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at Threave Reservoir in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
The manager of the camp, David Thompson, says the camp is an ideal place for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a huge area for bats", she says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, all of which are good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other colonies will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stressed that it was important to check for bats and to do new conservation work inside the nest, because the accidental destruction of one habitat can kill up to 400 males and young bats, thus possibly wiping out the entire population.
The girls are protected, and killing them, harassing them, disturbing them, or destroying their belongings is illegal.
Elizabeth Farrell, of the Scottish Girls' Trust, urged the community to come together to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we still don't know a lot about how many species live.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people want to use his name to promote themselves.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Major, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It was confirmed that he then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, called the claims "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just saying,
"What they're saying today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be recognized by saying my name, but that's part of it.
I'm a happy man and everything is going very well", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on what they call "personal unacceptable statements".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "psychological damage in proportion to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years".
They say the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the player's room, where he most likely raped her.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, fell at his feet and told him that he was a 99% good guy who was wrong to act because of the 1%.
The documents show that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but it was mutual consent.
Mayorgan also claims that he went to the police and had pictures of his wounds taken at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the matter out of court because he "feared retaliation" and did not want to embarrass himself in public.
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to cancel the decision because she is still suffering the consequences of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged allegations, Ronaldo had almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England, forever regretting the loss of its car manufacturers.
Britain will forever regret losing its reputation as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Economy Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was worrying when Toyota, England, told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Brunton plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that a no-deal Brexit could cause delays at the border and job losses.
The Branniston plant, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our plant", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Branson.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about how cross-border trade would play out if they leave the European Union without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
According to car companies, their main concern is with supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production is based on the "on time" principle, whereby parts for cars to order are received from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the European Union on March 29 without a deal, there will be disruptions at the border, which manufacturers say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus stop production.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union is "clearly weighted to exclude border checks".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not just to have the current success, but to take advantage of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The facts, not just from Toyota, but from other car manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to continue to have highly efficient supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately, reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvaleris, who has worked at Brynston for 24 years and is the head of the mass union at the factory, said that his members are very worried: "In my experience, if this kind of work goes, it never comes back".
The government spokesman said: 'We have developed a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, says White House
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavinach continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump aid and Russia ties, and possible miscarriages of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would remove the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a source of heated speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about wearing wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, with a pretext to announce his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he preferred not to remove Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Judiciary Committee, which was reviewing the testimony of Kavinah and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the Kavinah allegations, delaying a vote in the full Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was speaking on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "The date hasn't been set yet, it could be this week, I think it will be pushed back another week, given everything that's going on at the Supreme Court.
But, we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed of updates.
Some journalists disagree with the statement, Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Vallance asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press briefings was not due to a dislike of the show's behavior by television journalists, however, he said, "I don't deny the fact that it's show behavior".
Then he said that there would be more direct communication between Trump and the media.
"The president attends more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, without providing any evidence.
The press conference will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it would be better than talking to me.
We've tried very hard to do this, and you've seen that we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and it's going to happen again at a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with top officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why he behaves so reluctantly and sometimes strangely in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland's EU staff about concerns over Brexit.
The Health Secretary has written to NHS Scotland's EU staff to express the country's gratitude and their desire to remain in terms of Brexit.
MSP Jane Freeman has sent a letter saying she will leave within six months of Britain leaving the European Union.
The Scottish Government is already willing to accept the costs of residence status applications from EU citizens who have taken up employment in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU negotiations on leaving over the summer have continued, leading to the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a very unfortunate time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you again and again how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Partners in Europe and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare practices, and benefit patients and communities we threaten.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercombe is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christian Abercombe underwent emergency surgery for a head injury after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly after the semifinals.
"He crossed the sideline and it looked like he hit it", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercombe oxygen on the sidelines before moving him to the bench for further examination.
State official Chris Harris told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercomb is undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercombe, who was a two-year starter, is in his first season at Tennessee State since moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five power plays before he retired on Saturday, which added up to a total of 18 power plays for him this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for stamp duty when buying property in England.
Foreign buyers will pay more for stamp duty when buying property in England, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under the Tory plan.
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in pensions will be for those who do not pay taxes in England.
The Treasury is planning to increase the annual amount of aid to the homeless by up to £120 million.
Foreign buyers will pay more in stamp duty when buying property in England, with the extra money earmarked for homelessness, Theresa May announced today.
The move would be seen as an attempt to neutralize Corbyn's success in winning over young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting higher-income earners.
The increase in the tax rate will remain for individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes in England, providing additional money for the government to tackle the homeless problem.
The premium added to the current stamp price, including the high-end second home and rental purchases introduced two years ago, can be as much as 3 percent.
The Treasury estimates that the move will bring in £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the city.
A week after Boris Johnson approved a stamp duty cut, a new policy will be put in place to allow more young people to buy their first home.
He accused the big building companies of seizing land but not using it to keep house prices high and convinced Ms. May to make houses affordable to solve England's shameful housing problem.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reforms, including rate controls and an end to wrongful dispossession.
He also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Miss May said, "Last year I said that I would work to help revive the English dream that life would be better for any new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-UK based organisations to buy a home as it is for highly employed UK citizens.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership is becoming more elusive, and the contempt of homelessness is becoming more real.
Jack Ross: My main goal is to govern Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland's first ever manager.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenge of rebuilding North-East, who are now third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having recalled St Mirren from the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B hat and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up seeing Scotland as a child with my dad in Hambden, and that was something that always stuck with me.
That opportunity would only come if I was a successful club manager.
As manager of Sunderland, Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alordi, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has no qualms about following such stable people at such a big club who have previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be measured by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
With the structure and capabilities of this club, it is definitely in the Premier League.
"It's not an easy task to achieve, but I will probably only see my success if I can get the club back there".
Ross is just three years into his managerial career, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from relegation to the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now than he ever did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his playing career.
"It was probably a real dilemma", he said of taking over Alloa.
I truly believe that management was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was playing well, and making a good living from it, as well as enjoying some important highs.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through during the week.
I'm still going through all this work stress and pressure, but management is more soulful.
I've always wanted to be in charge, and now that I'm doing it, I feel much more comfortable than I've ever done in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full Sportsound interview on Saturday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland, from 12:00 to 13:00 (BST).
According to research, the best time to drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat is providing a revenue stream for struggling bars in England, but it's also putting even more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the indicators, the bar groups have a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but the restaurant revenue is down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, the business consultancy that released the data, said: "Continuing hot weather and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance meant that July also followed the pattern of June, when bar revenues rose 2.8 percent, except for restaurants, which were hit hardest".
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June was worse in July.
Alcohol has made bars and pubs work better than it has made restaurants work worse.
Food also slowed down pubs in the summer, although not as bad as restaurants.
It's like people just go out to drink.
Pubs and bars saw sales of drinks rise 6.6 percent in one month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM's entertainment and hospitality analysis, said, "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the biggest factors when it comes to outdoor market sales.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-over-year decline in sales will particularly affect current maximum spending.
A long hot summer could not be a worse time for food producers, and it will be seen over time whether the milder temperatures in August will provide some of the rest they have been waiting for.
The overall sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting declines in brand investment.
Coffer Peach Tracker's monitoring of sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector in England gathered and analysed the performance of 47 operating groups, which had a combined £9 in revenue, and is a benchmark for the sector.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
According to a study, one in five 11-year-olds has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 middle school students found a rise in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears that sexual information is spreading
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account to show their parents.
One in five 11-year-olds has a social media account that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 middle school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts, citing the photo sharing site Instagram.
This news has fueled fears that sexual information is spreading.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "basic" account to show their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who exposed her 13-year-old daughter's secret website exposed a young man who was persuading others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Private Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, half of whom admit to having a personal account.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many young people are being tempted to create an online platform where parents and teachers can't find them.
Ellie Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Ellie Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected athlete and President Ian Beady said the move was a good opportunity for sporting authorities to benefit from his vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Ellie is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, England and around the world, and we are confident that advising her will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland", said Beedie.
Doyle said, "I would love to be the voice of the athletes and hopefully really have a voice and help govern sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted, "This is the day a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a tough job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing some movement.
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows is making online opinions.
The Breast Pump Association has a viral online ad that compares nursing mothers to milk cows.
To promote what it calls the world's first silent wearable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a light-hearted music video, a commercial that shows the freedom that the new breast pump gives mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a herd of grass-fed cows to a song that goes something like this: "Yes, I'm lying, but you don't see a tail", and in case you haven't noticed, these aren't anyone else's, these are my boobs.
The band goes on. "Push them out, push them out, I feel it, baby, push them out, push them out, I'm going to hit my gums.
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has been the subject of controversy on the online platform.
With 77,000 comments and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it mocks the dairy industry's horrors.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows for this product.
They have to get pregnant and give birth to get milk, except that their babies aren't stolen from them a few days after they're born", one person wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is inserted into the feeding tube (Elvie/Mother) without being noticed.
Another commented, "Obviously traumatic for mother and child".
But, yeah, why not use them as a breast pump to advertise to mothers who buy them to keep their babies.
Another added, "What kind of unreality ad?"
Others defended the ad, one woman admitted that she thought the song was very funny.
I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it was presented.
"This is a great product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad that targets mothers who are sleeping (often in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like a pussy".
This is not an ad that praises or criticizes dairy production.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with pumps hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who suck their breasts feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubing, and seamlessly fits into the feeding tube, allowing the woman to move freely, hold the baby, and even leave the house during the feeding.
Anna Ballarin, ECD and partner at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a lively and provocative launch.
By doing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all the challenges that come with it, in a fun and relational way, showing the indescribable sense of freedom that comes with the pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, two mothers appeared on stage with designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children on the Texas border slowly moved into the tent camp.
While monthly border crossings have remained relatively flat, the number of detected immigrant children has risen rapidly, in part because of the strict policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it harder to provide sponsors for children.
Usually, many of the sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when state authorities announced that prospective sponsors and adult household members would be required to provide their fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are criminal aliens.
So we're still looking for these individuals", said Mr. Albenz.
To speed up the investigation of the children, officials introduced a new law that would require them to appear in court within a month of being discovered, instead of the 60 days that, according to the court, were the previous standard for the workers.
Many will use videoconferencing instead of going in person to petition immigration court to legalize their case.
Those who do not meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer these children are in detention, the more likely they are to become violent or depressed, which can lead to explosions and escape attempts.
Lawyers say that this concern is greater in large areas like Tornillo, where, because of the size of the area, it is easier to see children suffering.
They added that moving children to a city of refuge without preparing them psychologically or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can leave them with the trauma that many already suffer.
Syria is asking the US, France and Turkey to withdraw their occupation forces.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister of International Affairs Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Muallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and should be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Muallem claimed that the "war on terror" is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue this holy fight until all Syrian territory was cleared of both terrorist groups and the presence of foreigners.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training or advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the country at war.
Speaking about refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and accused some Western countries of spreading "anti-Semitic fears" that keep refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement to end the war between Assad and his opposition forces.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, has provided an opportunity to push forward political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of 3 million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military operations would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be called up.
UN Ambassador Stéphane de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition representatives to draft a constitution for post-war Syria, paving the way for elections.
Muallem presented the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee's activities, saying that the committee's activities should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal television viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency.
This will be, without a doubt, the most tragic end of your presidency ever.
So far, we're not seeing any fatigue among the television audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million, and tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox New has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up 1.7 million from four years ago, Nielsen says, while MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers during prime-time news nights.
"This is the fire that people are reaching for, because it's something we don't understand", said Neil Byers, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", a movie about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack collapses the Capitol.
Neil Scovel, the veteran comedy writer who wrote "Only the Laughing Episodes: A Few Cruel Truths About Breaking into a Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why, he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scowell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike what's on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe v. Wayne, regardless of whether immigrant families can reunite and regardless of the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it's beyond being an informed citizen when you watch for six hours as a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of unsolicited sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket -- a garment covered in a thick layer of fur, as the Washington Post put it -- and Storm Daniels's indecent description of Trump's, well, anatomy.
I, for example, will never watch Super Mario the way I used to.
Speaking about the changing cast and daily plot twists of Trump's show (going up against the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, said, "To make it look like a reality show, he specifically orders you to do something every day".
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
When I called Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his house on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and CNN on tape.
He couldn't push himself away because Brett Kavanaugh was going to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing these crazy shows, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" said Flea.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money out there is flowing into the House of Representatives hot midterm elections
It's no surprise that there's a huge cash flow into Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District thanks to redistricting, which has two current members of the House of Representatives running for one seat.
This recently reorganized Pittsburgh suburb is contested by Democrat, current House member Conor Lamb, who was elected from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another Republican Congressman, Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the current 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled last January that the old districts were unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of the Republicans.
In the newly formed 17th district, the race led to a campaign financing competition between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning Pennsylvania's 18th district in a March primary.
For 10 years, the seat was held by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States took the opportunity to punish El Salvador for its support of China seriously, and then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and also had a hotel in Panama before his partners dismissed the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only intended against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US sales in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and crime rates.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any intentions to punish El Salvador.
Vice President Michael Pence is now expected to address the conference in mid-October, in a sign of the administration's emphasis on the meeting, diplomats said.
Three American diplomats have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further stiff stimulus or sanctions from Washington.
Mr Bolton's spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussions, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their estimates were backed up by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next step could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice, which has very strong evidence in public records.
It is said that Mr. Mueller is conducting his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to attack our election.
If there is a change in leadership in Congress, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and possibly his peers in social standing.
So there are a number of assumptions, and I'm not going to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support the Czechoslovakian representatives in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
These are turning points in history, and the development of the brutal events of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Now Americans are living through these turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's intelligence?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this document revealed that last year he offered to wiretap the president and questioned his fitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
"How will we proceed if the FBI investigation into the newly interrogated Brad Kevinah is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
But first, we're going to vote for Congress in a midterm election, which Mr. Trump will be accountable to.
If we fail these tests, democracy will survive a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He was saved by immigrating to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light a candle on this table on Saturday with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?
Norman Eisner, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chairman of Ethics and Responsibility at Citizens in Washington, and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and a Legendary House.
Ranger Graham Dorrance was optimistic before the Rapid Vienna crash.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria, which followed an impressive performance by Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, would put them high on their way to qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury in the semi-final, Graham Dorrance was unable to play in his first match of the season before a 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are on a good side", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game believing that we would get there, and we did.
Maybe we could catch it at the end, generally, the draw was probably fair.
They probably played better in the first round and we played better in the second round.
Thursday is another important European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good shot in the last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push forward and have a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but I'm very happy with the situation.
The team is really good, and the guys really enjoy it, and the training is good.
Hopefully, now we can move on, leave the past season behind and be successful.
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be buried, few of them talked to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the people in a nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their kids about it.
"People want their family members to be cared for, but they don't take steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them about your wishes ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss when and where you want to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor, who can also help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your sources of funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-and-value life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money as long as you have the money.
Get your legal papers. Stay out of legal wrangling.
Get your health care professional so you have someone you trust to take care of your health care and make sure that the specialist meets your needs in case you can't communicate.
Also, remember the importance of a lawyer for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your payments are made if you are unable to work.

In Ilfracombe, a man fired several rounds from an air rifle.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home from a night walk.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the shooter.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, with deaths still expected to rise.
Due to the loss of communications, rescue workers were unable to get any information from the Dongalla area, the area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palou, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the islands of Sulawesi, Pali and Donggala.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a region over 300 km (180 mi) long on the northwest coast of Sulawesi island.
The region, which is an administrative region, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the cornerstones of the economy in the Central Sulawesi region, especially for the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also very important to the region, but it's mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and injured hundreds in Dongala.
The tsunami also damaged the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific ring of volcanoes, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years.
2004: A major earthquake in the Aceh region on the west coast of Indonesia struck northern Sumatra on December 26, affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal area, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coastal region of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook northern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami in the southern region, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the region near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly and devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, the tsunami failed, but more than 100 people died because of collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed hundreds of buildings and temporarily put thousands of tourists on the alert.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
Treacy Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Peeling, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Palin is in pre-trial detention at Man-Su Isolation and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he stood in front of the courtroom, where, when asked to accept the plea, he declared that he was "absolutely not guilty", the network reports.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is now pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claims he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups heavily criticized Sarah Palin after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of serving in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video that's circulating on social media shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered in the city of Palo to attend a beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack, which is rare.
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saifov, a suspect in a terrorist attack that killed eight people.
Saipov, 30, allegedly drove a truck rented from Home Depot into a bike lane on the Inner Manhattan Side of the Highway, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm", according to a notice of intent filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both articles carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, jurors bribed Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, extortion, which prosecutors typically use in organized crime, as well as violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "immediate planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's handling of the baking as "abhorrent, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habybulievich Saipov has caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lore Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time the death penalty was used in the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of conscience for days and months.
The police say he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for an Islamic State flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that using the death penalty instead of life without parole with a guilty plea would only prolong the traumatic events that these events have caused for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says the responsibility for Brexit negotiations should be placed on the UK's top brass.
At a protest at the Tory Conference today, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize an army of people.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the warmth of Eurosceptics because one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, told a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been out of the war if Mr Farage had been a Brexit minister.
But Theresa May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been heightened by the Tories' joining the anti-Brexit rally.
Amid attacks from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU, the prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan, dubbed "The Skin", alive.
Allies insisted that he continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his proposed package and Brexit.
Mr. Ben in Solihull said during a protest that "Leaving means leaving" and he wanted to "give up the hat".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a partner and put in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
The member for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must forgo the gamble".
Presenting his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight the world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
And the pro-Brexit Conservative, Andrea Jennings, who was also in the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chess is not popular, the opposition is not encouraged to vote for it, it is not supported by our party, and it is not supported by the activists who are the first to go out and vote for us.
Please stop playing chess and start listening.
In a tough statement to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that the politicians marching in must be made to feel the heat if they are to reverse the decision they made in 2016.
"Today, it's a question of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you digest that.
In a speech to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to warm up our political class on the brink of betraying Brexit.
We are mobilizing an army of the people of this country who have dedicated to us our victory over Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
Several activists have been waving Tory flags against Brexit flags since the group was formed this week.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Tories at the opening of the conference over security concerns with their party's mobile app.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have all the IT technology to have a Canada plus plus, a free trade border with Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he said.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about his future at a town hall rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and will face Republican Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There are speculations that he may challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood on Saturday afternoon was Trump's 36th town hall meeting with voters since he became president.
One of the people asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and rebuild the broken government, including the highest office.
LSU Sims was arrested for the shooting.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m. today at an ET news conference.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed outside the Southern University student neighborhood Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died, " Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and took a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene and being armed and admitted to shooting Wade Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-1.98-inch third-year player from Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship when team tactics give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Walter Bottas took the lead on Saturday over Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that team tactics would play a big part in the race.
Bottas started well and nearly knocked Hamilton out, holding his ground for the first two turns and calling on Bethel to attack his teammate.
Bethel was the first to get in a bad situation, and he let Hamilton hit the tail of the jam, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later entered and exited the circuit behind Bethel, but Hamilton took the lead with a sharp step, with the Ferrari reluctantly exiting the inner track to defend himself in the third corner after a double-step to the danger of a collision.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then first for most of the race and aimed to get to the finish quickly and pass Kimmy Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He eventually reached the point in lap 44, but failed to gain speed in the remaining eight laps, while Rykkonen entered fourth.
It's a tough day because Walter's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and being a gentleman, he let me in.
"The team did such an extraordinary job, one by two", Hamilton said.
The body language was a very unsuccessful expression
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during the campaign when she claimed that Christine Blaise Ford did not distribute a letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
In his speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony of Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were evil and vicious and liars.
"The only thing that could have happened, and the only wonderful thing that's happened in the Senate over the last two days, is when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and evil and lying", he said.
When you read the news and the news reports, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread the word?
Remember his answer -- did you distribute the document?
Oh, no, not really.
I'm not going to spread it.
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we spread it? "No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford alleging Kavanaugh, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that his office had leaked it.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not spread his story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did".
But his denial did not sit well with the president, who commented at the race Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a very unfortunate display of body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen such a bad sign of body language.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are ready to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the malevolence, they don't care who they hurt, who they go through to gain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars took a rematch from their Elite League opponent on Friday, winning 5-3 in a replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were given a two-goal lead early on the clock with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier hitting.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied the score, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee, then Lucas Lanvalde Nilsen's goals ensured the victory for them.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's side, who had moved into first place by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
The first goal of the duel came in the 3:35 minute from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford giving the pass and Bouvier doubling the lead four minutes later.
In the first half, Sullivan turned the game around for the home side at 13:10 and then tied the score with Matt Marquardt at 15:16.
Due to the duels, the Giants team got lucky considering when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The owners of the field reorganized and Bouchard again tied their score with a majority lead in the 27th minute and 37th minute.
Crowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the second half, and he did everything he could to help his side win the fifth and final game of the season.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, are back home in Milton Keynes, preparing for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies after saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after taking all necessary measures to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake continues to erupt in the area, leaving many people in the city of Palous under rubble.
Twenty-one-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agung refused to leave his checkpoint at the heavily shaken control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in the city of Palo despite his colleagues fleeing.
He stayed in his position and did everything he could to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from a traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
According to ABC News in Australia, Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Siret said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"Our hearts sank when we found out about it", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities say the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's Disaster Management Agency says that entry to Donggala, Siji and Butong is restricted.
"The death toll may rise as there are still many bodies under the rubble, and some are still not being removed", said agency spokesman Soutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
The head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: "The International Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will encounter there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to accomplish any evacuation task".
Are you ready? CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Micronesia now says one person is missing. Earlier it had reported that all 47 passengers and crew on board had been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a man was missing as of noon Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for further details (age or nationality) about the passenger.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Truk Island Airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the bay not far from the runway.
Some of the mines believe the plane has gone off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed too low.
"That's too good", said Janez.
Janes said that he and others managed to reach the sinking plane's emergency exits in the water as far as the belt.
He said the dispatchers were screaming in panic and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing the nearby harbor also helped rescue people in a steamboat before the ship sank about 100 feet (30 m) into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belonging to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timeline of the night of the woman's murder
On Saturday, a court reopened a trial of a man who burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said she received a location call from several cellphones that showed Tallis was with her the night Chambers died, contradicting her earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was next to Chambers's phone when Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified from the witness stand that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tallis was right about spending the night in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Tallis said she knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Roulette said that some time after Chambers died, Tallis deleted his texts, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"She erased him from her life", Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative attitudes toward hip-hop by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently enjoyed a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a racist message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discrimination in her dismissal after receiving a text message to the wrong address saying she's just another black person.
The husbands deny being racist and liken the lawsuit to embezzlement.
A mother of two, Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, was alarmed to learn that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she started her first day in 2016.
"I am a self-made man", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After realizing his mistake, "uncomfortable", Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying their current nanny, an African-American, had done a poor job and that he was a Filipino waitress, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home by Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple, demanding compensation for the dismissal and expecting $350 for each day of the six months he was hired to live in the workplace, even though they had no contract.
"I want to show them that you see, don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discrimination".
The husbands responded to the accusations of racism against them by saying that it was wise to fire Morris because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't going to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children with someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn child.
Stop it.
Comparing the lawsuit to a "deficit", Plasco said his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
And you're going to go after someone like that?
"That's not a good thing", the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to criticize the husbands on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not be drawn to the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself as someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting today to know what we know about the enormous success of Paddington.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book about the little bear, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had caused conflicting feelings since his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she considered an important member of the family, she added that her father was quietly proud of his potential success.
"He was a very quiet person, and he was not a boastful person", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to her, it's almost like having a child who's accomplished something, you're proud of it, even though it's not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington in a way.
Although it was his invention and his imagination, he had a habit of giving Paddington credit.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the crash, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Ned kept calling to say that things were really bad, that he couldn't handle it", said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Ned, who said he was going to die in a few minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart functioning were slowly losing their power and leaving his system.
He died some time before that, and that was the end of it.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that it wasn't going to work out.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep my cool.
Finally, Miss Edna Laperouse, still mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, forgetting the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knows", he said.
I hung my head and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I had this feeling of unlimited sympathy for Ned.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The grieving women wrote an open letter to prevent suicide on the bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to stop other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys wrote open letters on Welsh Bridge with encouraging calls and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Miss Davis' son Taylor was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew her for her laugh.
They always said her smile lights up the room.
However, he had left his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have devastating consequences".
Miss Davis made the cards to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent, you need to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who was a friend of Miss Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"She didn't say she was feeling bad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was in a terrible state at Christmas, when the kids opened their cups, he didn't look them in the eye, etc.
She said that her death was a big shock to them, but they had to deal with it.
It just destroys us.
But we all have to face it and fight it.

Brad Kevinah's fate hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, intelligence has a limited time, a limited framework, we could reach unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was being divided under the military's stated constraints.
Why do Mr. Kevinah and his Republican supporters want FBI intelligence?
Their complaints are all about time.
With only five weeks left until the midterm elections, which are on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans fail, their chances of electing anyone they want to the nation's highest court will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush would pick up the phone to call the senators, lobby them to support Mr. Kevinah, who worked for the Bush White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the Fed report comes out?
The Senate is going to be a hotly contested election, with 51% Republicans and 49% Democrats.
It's not clear if Mr. Kevinah will be able to get 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence a chance to level the playing field and establish himself on the Supreme Court.
North Korean lawlessness has declined under Kim.
North Korea's crime rate has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the North Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the Northern United Ministry, said there were 1,127 violations last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high tariffs on smugglers were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean outlaws eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the well-defended demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China treats asylum seekers as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them home.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss a nuclear arms freeze.
This followed a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US sanctions of being less successful since they were imposed.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and under these circumstances, it is impossible to unilaterally declare a ceasefire", Mr. Rin said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brad Kevinahi "hysterical", says he is not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brad Kevinah "hysterical" and said he was not behaviorally qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, during an interview on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acts like this, she's called hysterical", Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday about her reaction to Kevinah's testimony.
Kevinah emotionally denied the allegations that he allegedly sexually assaulted Christine Blaise Ford when they were both young.
In her opening remarks, Kevinah was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and yelling, when talking about her family and school years.
He also blamed the committee's Republicans, calling the accusations against him "ridiculous nonsense" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Kevinah's testimony proved that she couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that she was anti-Republican.
"I think he's disqualified himself by his testimony and his behavior toward Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to impeach Kevinah if her nomination was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House.
"I'll say this, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit for the Supreme Court, but the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kevin is now a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the Affordable Care Act or Kevinah's possible decisions against the Roe v. Wade controversy because she is considered a conservative justice.
During his confirmation hearings, Kevinah avoided questions about whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's clear rulings.
"Now is not the time for a rowdy and biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman has to master that.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of anger pouring out, and she can't get over it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinman told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, is it?
He continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere who said she cried when she was angry, but she developed a trick that suggests that when she's angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "That's great".
Tears are allowed, in particular, to release resentment, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid working memories in a male-dominated office was one day when I was caught in a rage of tears, and a woman older than me, a cold manager who I was always a little bit scared of, grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the steps.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with presidential candidate Gary Hart on the campaign trail.
In 1987, when she was arrested with a woman on board the Monkey Business and accused of having an extramarital affair, she came to my door from a campaign. Deeply disappointed, Mrs. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not consider running in person.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they wanted.
Some people called it "The White Rabbit and the Seven Gables".
Because it was late in the campaign, he was behind in fundraising, and he vowed not to get into the fight unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that his followers, who were supposed to give him $1000, were only giving him $250.
"What, they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she made the speech announcing that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed with emotions (gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, anger at sexism) that she was choking.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown", said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling the reaction to her by the press.
You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what my tombstone would say.
She was crying.
How a US-China trade war can be good for China.
The first U.S.-China trade border clashes were a disaster, and the struggle between the two countries could benefit China in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued a warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, which include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week when new tariffs were imposed, affecting a total of $200 million (£150 million) worth of goods - in fact, half of all US imports from China were taxed.
Beijing has responded appropriately each time, most recently imposing a 5-10% tariff on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to the US, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down from its demands would be a sign of compliance, but publicly humiliating the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing can use its cards right, U.S. trade pressure could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that hasty policy decisions in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for economic stalemate in both countries is actually more dangerous than observers previously admitted", said Abigail Regress, a researcher at the New America Security Analysis Center who works on Asia.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, with the progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation is more stable and secure on the ground", he said.
To restore normal life, the government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorism.
Today, all the conditions are in place to ensure that refugees return to the countries they left behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he noted that it would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe celebrates its victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States now has six consecutive losses on the European field and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title after Denmark's Thomas Björn's team scored 14.5 points, which was needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Nicholson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, sent the ball into the water after the third shot, losing the game to Francesco Molinari in the 16th inning.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since 1979.
American Jordan Spitzer was eliminated 5-4 by Denmark's Torbjörn Olsen, the lowest rated player on the European team.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Paulter, who may have been playing his last Ryder Cup.
With 25.5 points, Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I was able to be useful", said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
He congratulates his compatriot John Ramey, who on Sunday defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods in the singles.
"I feel incredible pride after beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who all played at a high level throughout the tournament, the entire U.S. team struggled to find ways to make ends meet.
US captain Jim Furyk, speaking after a disappointing game for the team, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought hard.
This morning, we put pressure on the Europeans.
We are broken.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a brilliant senior.
His 12 players did very well.
We're gonna get back together, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to deliver value.
We were outnumbered.
Red wave update: concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission is warning that the Tampa Bay area is seeing a general decline in red tide concentrations.
According to the regional agreement, active blooms are being reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier regions, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The red wave blooms about 130 miles (208 kilometers) from Pinellas in the north to Lee's southern regions.
Areas can be found within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the coastline of Hillsborough County, but less frequently than last week.
Pasco County also saw a Red Wave.
Last week, there were medium concentrations in or near Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in the coastal areas of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Mantee County and Sarasota and coastal areas, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in the coastal areas of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee counties, there are still reports of respiratory infections.
No reports of respiratory infections in the last week.
